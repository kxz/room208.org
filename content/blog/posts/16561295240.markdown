I’ve always tended to make configuration changes first and messily back
them out later when they end up not working. Since I probably won’t lose
that bad habit any time soon, the next best thing I can do is make the
second half of this process easy. Enter etckeeper, which puts /etc under
version control. In addition to wrapping your favorite DVCS, etckeeper
also keeps track of file permissions for sensitive data and integrates
with common package managers. The way it uses the user’s “real” login
name instead of root for commits is a nice touch, useful for keeping
track of who did what on servers with multiple admins.
