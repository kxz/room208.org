FFmpeg’s animated GIF encoder seems to use a predetermined palette
instead of picking one based on the input frames. It’s pretty tragic. On
the other hand, trying to do resize operations with ImageMagick is slow
as hell.

Most anime is drawn on twos, meaning that the content only actually
changes every two frames. Hence the `convert` invocation picks out just
the even-numbered images and halves the framerate. Arguably, you could
do this with FFmpeg’s `-r` parameter, but who cares.
