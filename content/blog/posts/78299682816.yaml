    \ of Hugger\u2019s provision of the Internet Hug, including, but not limited to,\
    \ emotional distress, physical injuries such as carpal tunnel, or failure to understand\
    \ that Enhugged is actually a hedgehog made out of lethal spikes.</p></li>\n \
    \ <li><p>Hugger acknowledges that Enhugged\u2019s acceptance of the Internet Hug\
    \ is not to be construed as an indication of romantic interest, friendly camaraderie,\
    \ possession of the basic literacy required to comprehend the Internet Hug, or\
    \ anything beyond acceptance of the Internet Hug itself.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Upon\
    \ receipt of the Internet Hug from Hugger, Enhugged may choose to reciprocate\
    \ with a Return Internet Hug of Enhugged\u2019s own. Hugger acknowledges that\
    \ many factors enter into the provision of any Return Internet Hug, and that the\
    \ presence or absence of a Return Internet Hug should not be construed as evidence\
    \ of a favorable or unfavorable view of the original Internet Hug on the part\
    \ of Enhugged. In particular, Hugger acknowledges that events such as walking\
    \ away from the keyboard to use the bathroom, computer crashes, and being devoured\
    \ whole by an invisible Burmese python that has been lurking in Enhugged\u2019\
    s room for years may adversely affect Enhugged\u2019s ability to deliver a Return\
    \ Internet Hug, regardless of Enhugged\u2019s desire to do so or lack thereof.</p></li>\n\
    \  <li><p>Should Hugger wish to provide Enhugged with further Internet Hugs, Hugger\
    \ must submit a separate application for each one.</p></li>\n  <li><p>IN THE EVENT\
    \ THAT HUGGER AND ENHUGGED REGULARLY MEET FACE-TO-FACE, HUGGER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT\
    \ IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE WEIRD SHOULD HUGGER REGULARLY DELIVER INTERNET HUGS TO\
    \ ENHUGGED, BUT NOT ACTUAL PHYSICAL HUGS WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ITSELF.\
    \ DOESN\u2019T HUGGER SEE HOW ENHUGGED MIGHT BE GETTING MIXED SIGNALS ABOUT THAT?</p></li>\n\
    \  <li><p>Hugger acknowledges that, should Hugger wish to change the terms of\
    \ this agreement at any time, Enhugged might not be ready for that sort of thing,\
    \ and is likely to use various stalling tactics in an attempt to avoid thinking\
    \ too hard about it, including but not limited to asking Enhugged\u2019s lawyers\
    \ for legal advice.</p></li>\n  </ol><ul><li><strong>Applicant\u2019s signature:</strong></li>\n\
