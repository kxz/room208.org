description: <p>I&rsquo;ve always tended to make configuration changes first and messily
  back them out later when they end up not working. Since I probably won&rsquo;t lose
  that bad habit any time soon, the next best thing I can do is make the second half
  of this process easy. Enter etckeeper, which puts /etc under version control. In
  addition to wrapping your favorite DVCS, etckeeper also keeps track of file permissions
  for sensitive data and integrates with common package managers. The way it uses
  the user&rsquo;s &ldquo;real&rdquo; login name instead of root for commits is a
  nice touch, useful for keeping track of who did what on servers with multiple admins.</p>
