body: '<p>So I had this idea for a visual novel mechanic, probably inspired by playing
  too many <cite>Infinity</cite> series games, where the player takes the role of
  a &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; who can&rsquo;t actually talk to any of the characters, but
  can interact with their environment when no one&rsquo;s looking. At the beginning
  and end of every scene, you would get a chance to either remove objects from the
  &ldquo;stage,&rdquo; or place things that you&rsquo;ve taken in previous scenes.
  One scene might be set in a kitchen, for instance, where you&rsquo;d get the opportunity
  to take a knife from the counter and later conveniently leave it at the scene of
  a particularly tense fight.</p>


  <p>I have a feeling this has been done before, but I can&rsquo;t recall where.</p>


  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> I suppose I should mention that the idea was to have the
  stage-setting replace choices as the primary plot branching mechanism. Going back
  to the knife example, let&rsquo;s say the climactic dust-up is between Alice, who
  is relatively weak physically, and Mallory, who&rsquo;s fairly strong. Leaving the
  knife for Alice in that scene would thus mean the difference between her getting
  overpowered almost immediately and her having a shot at fending for herself. (In
  fact, my biggest qualm with this concept is that it could quickly turn into a combinatorial
  tar pit given enough manipulable objects and scenes.) A few people have showed me
  adventure games with a &ldquo;ghost director&rdquo; mechanic at their core, but
  they all seemed fairly linear plot-wise.</p>'
