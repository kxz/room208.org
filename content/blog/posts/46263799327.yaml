  \n<p>I got a couple of responses to this effect, and I want to say that while the\
  \ concept of &ldquo;magical potential&rdquo; is a valid justification in-story,\
  \ it doesn&rsquo;t hold much water for me as a narrative device. This is largely\
  \ because we never see this constraint actually <em>restricting</em> anybody&rsquo;s\
  \ ability to make a wish, and as such it seems like an abstract limitation tossed\
  \ in at the last minute to satisfy a technical loophole instead of something that\
  \ must really be fought. This is in fact one of the things I was worried about almost\
  \ from the moment the concept of wishes came up in <em>Madoka</em>&rsquo;s early\
  \ episodes; without concrete boundaries on what is and isn&rsquo;t possible, boundaries\
  \ that are shown to be very much in effect from the outset, any story resolution\
  \ that involves such an open-ended mechanic is just asking for trouble. If we had\
  \ seen a character try and fail to make the same wish that Madoka eventually did,\
  \ Kyuubey&rsquo;s statement might have had a little more substance, but as it stands\
  \ it feels a bit like bringing up general relativity during a go-kart race.</p>"
