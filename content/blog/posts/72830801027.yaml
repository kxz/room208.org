  <p>Yes, yes, we all know you were acquired by Yahoo not too long ago. You don&rsquo;t
  have to shove it in our faces by adding a &ldquo;search the web&rdquo; option to
  the dashboard. I thought that died in the nineties.</p>


  <p>Come to think of it, Yahoo should be doing its best to avoid reminding us of
  things we thought died in the nineties.</p>
