Dear Tumblr,

It would be really nice if your [backup application for
Mac](http://www.tumblr.com/goodies) actually worked. You know, as in not
failing with a vague “API error” nine out of ten times I try to use it,
or claiming to succeed while silently failing to back up any of my
answer posts, or claiming to succeed while silently failing to back up
*anything at all*. Here’s a tip: If a hacked-together recursive wget is
easier and more convenient than your custom-built program, something is
very, very wrong. And don’t give me that “beta” garbage. Most betas are
at least functional.
