answer: '<p>I suspect that since the post type conversion doesn&rsquo;t have a value
  for the image field, Tumblr inserts a reference to a nonexistent image instead.
  (This isn&rsquo;t your fault; it&rsquo;s just a quirk of how the data is stored
  on the server.) Ordinarily, you&rsquo;d be able to delete it using the dashboard,
  but the button to do so only appears when you hover over the image. Since the image
  doesn&rsquo;t actually exist, it&rsquo;s displayed with a height of zero pixels.
  Can&rsquo;t really hover over that.</p>


  <p>What you can do, though, is simulate a click on the delete button. To do this,
  open up the broken post&rsquo;s edit page, and paste the following in the developer
  console:</p>


  <pre><code>$(''.remove-button'').first().click();

  </code></pre>


  <p>If you haven&rsquo;t added any other images yet, the standard <em>Upload photos</em>
  and <em>Add photo from web</em> options should appear inside the edit form, indicating
  that Tumblr thinks there are no longer any images attached to the post. In either
  case, save once you&rsquo;ve changed the images to your liking, and you should be
  on your merry way.</p>'

question: Hi! First off, thank you so much for the post about changing type of Tumblr
  post - I've managed to turn a couple of posts from text to photo. However, I'm a
  complete novice when it comes to codes, hacks, etc. and in both cases I end up with
  a blank ghost image at the beginning that I can't seem to get rid of. Do you have
  any idea what might be causing this? Thanks again!
