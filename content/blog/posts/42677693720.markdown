Cosmic spoilers:

> NGC 6357 is a nebula near NGC 6334 in the constellation Scorpius,
> given the name War and Peace Nebula by the Midcourse Space Experiment
> scientists because, in infrared images, the bright, western part
> resembles a dove, while the eastern part looks like a skull. Well,
> otaku stumbled on a pic of it and decided that it looks a whole lot
> like *Madoka Magica*’s Ultimate Madoka.

Someone even started [a Change.org
petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/international-astronomical-union-change-the-official-name-of-nebula-ngc-6357-to-the-madokami-nebula)
asking for NGC 6537 to be renamed the “Madokami Nebula.”
