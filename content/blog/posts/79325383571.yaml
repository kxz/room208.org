  \ <code>!important</code>. Tumblr defines all of <em>its</em> rules (namely <code>position</code>\
  \ and <code>top</code>) with <code>!important</code>, so unless we add that to our\

  \ up in here?) Until then, it&rsquo;s hack after hack after hack to &ldquo;fix&rdquo;\
  \ things that shouldn&rsquo;t be broken in the first place.</p>"
