Yasuhiro Yoshiura is back with another film, after running a victory lap
with the theatrical version of <cite>Time of Eve</cite>. This one looks
to be combining the endless underground aesthetic of <cite>Pale
Cocoon</cite> with a more expansive outside world; he talks about really
going outdoors for the first time, so to speak, in his director’s note.
It’s scheduled to hit Japanese theaters sometime this year.

Not many more details so far, but I love the promotional art.
