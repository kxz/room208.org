answer: '<p>My own personal conclusion on <em>From the New World</em> is that it&rsquo;s
  a visibly flawed series in many regards &ndash; in particular, it sets up a lot
  of questions in its first half that are pushed off to the side and never really
  answered in the second, which is unfortunate for a show that emphasizes its plot
  to such a degree. That being said, I&rsquo;m not going to deny that it was one of
  the year&rsquo;s most ambitious shows, particularly in its characterization, vocal
  performances (this is what put Risa Taneda on the map for a lot of people), and
  the breadth of its setting. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s worth seeing for those reasons
  alone, even if the whole package doesn&rsquo;t quite gel in the way some of my other
  picks do.</p>


  <p>(Incidentally, a somewhat harsher version of the previous paragraph would sum
  up my views on <em>Penguindrum</em>. I&rsquo;ve thought about writing a post on
  this commonality, but right now I&rsquo;ve concluded that I just don&rsquo;t have
  enough to say on the subject quite yet.)</p>'

question: Interesting that From the New World showed up on your best anime list, since
  I remember you complaining about it and IIRC it showed up as gray on the anime wall
  rather than green.
