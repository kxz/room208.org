  <p>One of my biggest frustrations with Makoto Shinkai&rsquo;s earlier work, <em>Voices
  of a Distant Star</em> especially, was how Shinkai always looked to be in some inexplicable
  hurry. With more emotionally resonant scenes, in particular, he tended to cut away
  before the images and words had gotten a chance to fully sink in. Even when he was
  at his most adept in <em>5 Centimeters Per Second</em>, I still found myself wishing
  that he would let his settings and characters breathe a little, especially given
  how stunning his visual depictions were.</p>


  <p><em>The Garden of Words</em> does not, strictly speaking, fix this problem. The
  first twenty minutes of its forty-five-minute run time positively fly by, really,
  as Takao Akizuki goes (or doesn&rsquo;t go) to school, watches his family drift
  apart, and strikes up a relationship with a mysterious older woman he meets in the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Gyoen">Shinjuku Gyoen</a> gardens.
  For the first time, though, this fast pace seems to be exactly what Shinkai is aiming
  for. Combined with the ever-impressive animation that is his trademark, the first
  half forms a tight yet beautiful expression of the whirlwind that is falling for
  someone else. Indeed, the whole film plays out as if Shinkai is developing his own
  peculiar art form, that of packing straightforward emotion into an ever more densely-written
  shorthand, and looked at from this angle, it&rsquo;s hard not to call <em>The Garden
  of Words</em> an unqualified success.</p>


  <p>This approach does, of course, have its downsides. Shinkai&rsquo;s aggressive
  distillation of his premise to its most basic elements will leave not a few viewers
  wanting for something more ambitious. However, after the mild disappointment of
  his previous feature-length, <em>Children Who Chase Lost Voices</em>, which consciously
  tried to reach for a epic scale, this may have been the movie that Shinkai needed
  to make. When it comes down to it, <em>The Garden of Words</em> is a powerfully
  concise assertion that no one else can beat Makoto Shinkai at his own game.</p>


  <p>P.S. Kana Hanazawa continues to impress as she expands into roles that I never
  would have thought could fit Nadeko Sengoku&rsquo;s voice actress.</p>'
