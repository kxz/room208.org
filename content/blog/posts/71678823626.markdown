My own personal conclusion on *From the New World* is that it’s a
visibly flawed series in many regards – in particular, it sets up a lot
of questions in its first half that are pushed off to the side and never
really answered in the second, which is unfortunate for a show that
emphasizes its plot to such a degree. That being said, I’m not going to
deny that it was one of the year’s most ambitious shows, particularly in
its characterization, vocal performances (this is what put Risa Taneda
on the map for a lot of people), and the breadth of its setting. I’d say
it’s worth seeing for those reasons alone, even if the whole package
doesn’t quite gel in the way some of my other picks do.

(Incidentally, a somewhat harsher version of the previous paragraph
would sum up my views on *Penguindrum*. I’ve thought about writing a
post on this commonality, but right now I’ve concluded that I just don’t
have enough to say on the subject quite yet.)
