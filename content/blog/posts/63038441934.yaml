  <p>I watched the first episode of <em>Beyond the Boundary</em> (<em>Kyoukai no Kanata</em>)
  today, and I liked what I saw. It&rsquo;s entirely too early for me to draw general
  judgments, of course, but so far director Taichi Ishidate has acquitted himself
  well in building a subdued, slightly off-kilter supernatural mood that draws the
  viewer in. But that&rsquo;s not what I really wanted to talk about &ndash; I really
  want to highlight Risa Taneda, who here lends her voice to Mirai. Most will know
  Taneda for playing <em>From the New World</em>&rsquo;s main protagonist Saki, where
  at points her vocal performance singlehandedly carried the show; she&rsquo;s also
  starred in a handful of comedy anime this year, <em>Yuyushiki</em> and <em>Kiniro
  Mosaic</em> among them. It&rsquo;s no mean feat that she sounds right at home no
  matter where she is, especially given that her characters seem to have very little
  in common with each other. The material she&rsquo;s been given in <em>Beyond the
  Boundary</em>&rsquo;s first episode isn&rsquo;t particularly strong, but it does
  serve as further evidence of how she can adapt to seemingly any role. I look forward
  to seeing what lies in store over the next few weeks, because it&rsquo;s looking
  good.</p>'
