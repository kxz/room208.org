Long story short: As user activity dwindles, the maintenance burden and
security risks are no longer worth it. Thus, come next April:

*   The EsperNet instance of Omnipresence will be shut down, along with
    the channel transcript viewer and [statistics](/stats/).

*   The [#yackfest QDB](https://qdb.room208.org/) and [the nightmare of
    fabrication](https://wiki.room208.org/), the Room 208 wiki, will be
    converted to read-only archives. Since static pages are cheap to
    serve, I plan to keep them online indefinitely, as with the existing
    [Omnibooru dumps](https://booru.room208.org/).

Since Omnipresence has not been under active development for some time,
I recommend chanops switch to a different bot instead of starting their
own Omnipresence instance, though I cannot suggest any particular bot as
a replacement.

Any further questions can be directed to me on IRC or
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/cdv2722). Cheers!
