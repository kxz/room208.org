  \ let&rsquo;s look at how adverbs are indicated instead. Here, Chinese uses the\
  \ affix character <span lang=\"zh\">\u5730</span>, while Japanese instead uses varying\

  >a large written vocabulary</a>. China and Japan&rsquo;s long shared histories make\
  \ tracing all this out rather complicated, but if you want a sloppy summary, there\
  \ were two large borrowings. First, way back in the single-digit centuries AD, Japanese\
  \ took a lot of existing Middle Chinese words. Then, in Japan&rsquo;s Meiji era,\
  \ a whole bunch of kanji neologisms were coined for imported concepts, and a lot\
  \ of these made their way back to China. You&rsquo;re not going to be able to figure\
  \ out even a majority of what&rsquo;s written in one language with only a knowledge\
  \ of the other, but some sentences will be pretty transparent.</p>\n\n<p>But then,\
  \ of course, there are the differing simplifications and preferred expressions for\
  \ certain phrases, which throws a wrench into the perhaps 20 percent (I made this\
  \ number up) mutual comprehensibility rate. At this point, it&rsquo;s getting late,\
  \ so I won&rsquo;t keep going.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: The original analogy is silly. Maybe\
