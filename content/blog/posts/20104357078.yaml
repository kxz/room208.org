  <p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t this stupid thing let me tab-complete commands, dammit?
  It&rsquo;s not seriously expecting me to type them all out, is it?&rdquo;</p>


  <hr><p>One of the things I enjoy about Christine Love&rsquo;s visual novels is that
  they expand the interface beyond the usual &ldquo;click through pages of text and
  occasionally make a choice&rdquo; paradigm. The command line above, for instance,
  is the way you first interact with a new game of <cite>Analogue</cite>, while the
  main story itself is explored (with the assistance of some AI helpers) through a
  graphical document browser that can be launched from the initial text-mode shell.
  Even if what you&rsquo;re doing is in some sense essentially the same as with a
  regular VN &ndash; reading long stretches of words on a screen &ndash; it feels
  like you&rsquo;re making some effort to discover the story on your own, rather than
  having it just presented to you.</p>


  <p>The layering of two different interfaces does an interesting job of both distancing
  you from and bringing you further into the game&rsquo;s plot. On the one hand, the
  presence of another environment external to the main archive reinforces your position
  as an outsider looking in on the characters&rsquo; past; appropriate, as you play
  the role of someone sent in to merely salvage the documents, not read them. On the
  other, though, it also makes the game seem more real &ndash; this is how you&rsquo;d
  actually be interacting with the story if you were in the player character&rsquo;s
  shoes, remotely interfacing with the computers of a starship floating dead in space.
  <cite>Analogue</cite> even explains why you can only give the AIs information in
  the form of binary choices. It&rsquo;s all impressively thought out.</p>


  <p>I&rsquo;m also a fan of <a href="http://isaacschankler.bandcamp.com/album/analogue-a-hate-story-ost">the
  soundtrack</a>, which plays a big role in setting the atmosphere: isolated, minimalistic,
  but not devoid of humanity.</p>


  <hr><p><cite>Analogue</cite> is, as with Love&rsquo;s other visual novels, fairly
  short; out of the five available endings, I&rsquo;ve already finished one, and that
  in just two and a half hours to boot. I&rsquo;ll probably come back here later with
  more detailed thoughts on the story proper once I&rsquo;ve tackled the other four.
  My initial impressions, though, are already very positive.</p>'
