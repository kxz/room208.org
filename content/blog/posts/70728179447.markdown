I was all ready to write a long post about my favorite anime of 2013,
but then I remembered that nobody actually reads anything longer than a
few paragraphs, so I’ve condensed it down into a few handy bulleted
lists. Shows continuing into January are not included; they’re on the
hypothetical list for next year. If you want more details on any of
these, feel free to fire a missive at [my
inbox](http://blog.room208.org/ask).

## New properties

-   *From the New World* (*Shinsekai Yori*)
