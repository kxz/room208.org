I’ve been a little short on things to do this holiday season, so I
decided to do the traditional thing and make a resource pack for
[0x40](http://0x40hues.blogspot.com/), everyone’s favorite Flash tool
for setting sampled music loops to shifting images of anime characters.
It currently has five songs, none of which has anything to do with the
others:

-   **OutKast**, “B.O.B.” (bad choice for a first song to transcribe)
-   **LCD Soundsystem**, “Us V Them” (by request of
    @[abandonedsteel](http://tmblr.co/msR8n9sluIH29761hmxMuTA){:.tumblelog})
-   **The Touch feat. Lina**, “Le Night Dominator”
-   **The Avalanches**, “Frontier Psychiatrist”
-   **Stereo Dive Foundation**, “Daisy”

Usage instructions:

1.  Download [the pack](https://room208.org/tmp/0100.zip).

2.  Open
    [0x40](https://googledrive.com/host/0B8QEardTLm8DQVItUFRpUXgyd3c/0x40%20Hues%20v5.0.swf)
    and press R when it’s loaded.

3.  Click “Load ZIP” and select `0100.zip`.

4.  Use the menus to select a song.

5.  …

6.  Yeah.

No points for figuring out why it’s called “0100.”
