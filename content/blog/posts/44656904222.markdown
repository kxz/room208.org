*Wolf Children* is simply breathtaking. I don’t know what to say about
it other than that director Mamoru Hosoda takes the best of his previous
film work – *The Girl Who Leapt Through Time*’s emotional resonance,
*Summer Wars*’ sense of discovery and adventure – and adds to that an
ambition and scale easily on the level of three or four lesser films. It
may be 160 minutes long, but the deftness and maturity on display make
the movie worth every minute. Go see it.
