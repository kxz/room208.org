answer: '<p>Have you ever had strychnine poisoning? Let me tell you, that&rsquo;s
  the last time I wander into some farmer&rsquo;s fields and treat them like an all-you-can-eat
  buffet. Fresh vegetables are <em>not</em> worth having those kinds of convulsions.
  I thought I was going to die, then I&rsquo;d wake up after I&rsquo;d thought that
  I was going to die, and think that I was going to die while I was dead. Even worse,
  I was fully conscious the whole time. It&rsquo;s like hell on earth.</p>


  <p>I&rsquo;ve <em>been</em> there.</p>'
