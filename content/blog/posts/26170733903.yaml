caption: <p>I was hoping for a beautiful marine goddess, but Urara&rsquo;s close enough.
  From <em>Tsuritama</em> episode 12, which by the way was a terrific ending to what
  is possibly the best series of the season. It&rsquo;s definitely a solid 8 in my
  books, maybe even a 9. I can&rsquo;t say I was expecting a show about four high
  school boys who fish together to have such a memorable cast or epic storytelling.
  Am I ever glad I was wrong.</p>
