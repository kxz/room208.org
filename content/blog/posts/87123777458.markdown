I’m getting ready to roll out a slew of changes as part of Dichotomy 4.0
(*four* point oh!), and they need to be run through their paces. New
features already implemented include support for background images and
avatar display using Tumblr’s new [global appearance
options](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes#global_appearance),
more streamlined layout settings, and hypoallergenic fairy dust. An
improved responsive design that better adjusts to varying screen sizes
is also on the cards. If you’d like to help out, visit
@[dichotomy-test](http://tmblr.co/mm2Cvq0gJ47fGByOThZhYbQ){:.tumblelog}
or slap the [raw
HTML](https://github.com/kxz/dichotomy/raw/develop/dichotomy.html) into
your theme editor, and report bugs either [on
GitHub](https://github.com/kxz/dichotomy/issues) or [by dropping them in
my ask box](http://blog.room208.org/ask). Thanks!
