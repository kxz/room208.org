This version of Dichotomy forces a fixed container width even for pages
with narrow content, adds support for Google Analytics’ Universal
Tracking snippet, and resolves a couple of other minor issues.

Who knows when this version will be available through the Tumblr Theme
Garden. I can apparently push changes through GitHub, but if I try to
update the theme description Tumblr complains about “invalid theme
HTML.” I’m guessing they don’t mean “invalid” the same way the W3C does,
because Tumblr mangles the markup so badly that [it’s literally
impossible to have a blog with valid
HTML](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fsafe.txmblr.com%2Ftheme%2Fpreview%2F38335).
Sigh.
