noitaminA has been on such a roll lately that I’ve been keeping my eye
on the remaining episode count, hoping that the brilliance doesn’t run
out before the season ends. It’s so weird to be simultaneously thinking
“Aw, we’re already two-thirds of the way done?” and “There are still
*four* whole weeks left?!”
