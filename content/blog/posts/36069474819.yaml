body: '<p><strong>EGOIST, &ldquo;Nameless Beasts&rdquo;</strong> (&ldquo;Namae no
  Nai Kaibutsu&rdquo;; <em>Psycho-Pass</em> ED). This is the first EGOIST song I&rsquo;ve
  heard where I&rsquo;ve felt Chelly&rsquo;s vocals really <em>click</em>; there&rsquo;s
  a sultriness to the chorus that was lacking in her previous outings and that fits
  well with <em>Psycho-Pass</em>&rsquo; darker atmosphere. The single will be out
  on December 5.</p>


  <p><strong>Suneohair, &ldquo;Slow Dance&rdquo;</strong> (<em>Say &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</em>
  ED). This one&rsquo;s already been released as a single; the guitar here is a bit
  reminiscent of &ldquo;Red Coat&rdquo; from the second season of <em>Arakawa Under
  the Bridge</em>.</p>


  <p><strong>Risa Taneda (as Saki Watanabe), &ldquo;Split Apple&rdquo;</strong> (&ldquo;Wareta
  Ringo&rdquo;; <em>From the New World</em> ED). There&rsquo;s no release date announced
  on this yet, which makes me think that a full version of the song won&rsquo;t show
  up until the soundtrack is released. Which is a shame, because its stuttering guitar
  line and overlapping vocals are a real treat.</p>'
