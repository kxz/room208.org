Remember when SHAFT was constantly running out of money because its
staff was seemingly constantly spending it on drugs? Ever since
*Madoka*, it’s been looking like that version of the studio was on its
way out. The first episode of *Sasami-san@Ganbaranai* tells us a
different story, though. Turns out the recent lack of
hallucination-grade trip material hasn’t been because SHAFT’s kicked its
habit – it’s just been saving its cash so that it can buy even more
drugs, at bulk prices.
