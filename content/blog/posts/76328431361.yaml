  <p>Have you considered allowing more than one file in a theme? Because as it stands
  now, you&rsquo;re basically forcing theme developers to inline several kilobytes
  of CSS and JavaScript for every page request. That&rsquo;s a pretty jaw-droppingly
  stupid waste of bandwidth.</p>


  <p>I mean, sure, it&rsquo;s <em>your</em> bandwidth. You can do what you want with
  it.</p>


  <p>I&rsquo;m just saying, it&rsquo;s pretty stupid.</p>
