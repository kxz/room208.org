  <p>Remember when SHAFT was constantly running out of money because its staff was
  seemingly constantly spending it on drugs? Ever since <em>Madoka</em>, it&rsquo;s
  been looking like that version of the studio was on its way out. The first episode
  of <em>Sasami-san@Ganbaranai</em> tells us a different story, though. Turns out
  the recent lack of hallucination-grade trip material hasn&rsquo;t been because SHAFT&rsquo;s
  kicked its habit &ndash; it&rsquo;s just been saving its cash so that it can buy
  even more drugs, at bulk prices.</p>'
