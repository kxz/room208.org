Shamus Young, on why EA’s business practices enrage customers, and how
blaming “greed” is ultimately an error of attribution:

> About twenty-five years ago, fast food places invented the idea of the
> value meal, combo meal, or whatever you call it when you order one
> item to get several. Before this, you had to order your burger, fries,
> and a drink individually. With a combo meal, you could just order a
> single item for a single price. Sure, maybe you used to get a small
> drink and now you get a medium and you didn’t usually get fries and
> now you do, but by gathering up the items under a single price point
> the restaurant can make things more convenient, get you to buy more
> food, and leave you with the impression that you somehow saved money.
> This was smart. This was a system devised by people who understood
> what consumers wanted and how they behaved.
>
> The stupid way around would be to make more money by charging people
> for small items. Charge for napkins. Charge for condiments. Charge for
> the cup, the ice, the tray, and the utensils. Charge people to enter
> the store, charge them to talk with other patrons, charge them for the
> bathroom, for window seats, for privacy, and for access to WiFi. This
> is how EA has been selling their games.
