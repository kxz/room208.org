*Kids on the Slope*, briefly: Started out well, hit some rough patches
around the ninth or tenth episode, never really recovered. **(Plot
details follow.)** There were some moments in the middle of the series
that recalled the swirling romantic complications of *Honey and Clover*,
but once Yurika and Junichi left the scene, things got a bit too rushed
and melodramatic for my taste. The school festival happened, Sentarou
got in a car accident, and then *eight years* passed by – and all the
while the main relationships between Kaoru, Sentarou, and Ritsuko seemed
to go virtually nowhere, or even regress. I do dislike “*x* years later”
endings in general, but this one in particular just seemed too easy. On
the positive side, the music was (of course) good, and coupled with the
best animation of “live” performances I’ve yet seen. Again, a series
that’s hard to fault on the technicals. Probably a solid 7.
