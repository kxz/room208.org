text: And we can even add weird things like <code>Array#forty_two</code>. You cannot
  read the comment here, but it says, &lsquo;Equal to <code>self[41]</code>. Also
  known as accessing &ldquo;the reddit&rdquo;.&rsquo; This sort of came out of a thread
  on reddit where somebody was complaining so loudly &ndash; why we would care to
  add <code>second</code> and <code>third</code> and <code>fourth</code> to <code>Array</code>.
  'This is redundant! There&rsquo;s already a mathematical approach to doing the same
  thing!&rsquo; It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to them. It was <em>weird</em>. Like,
  why would somebody care about this level of aesthetics? And just to spite them,
  I added <code>forty_two</code>.
