While we’re on the subject of noitaminA, the block’s been celebrating
its tenth anniversary with a few specials. This one’s a charming short
film called *Poulette’s Chair* (*Poulette no Isu*), directed by
independent filmmaker Hiroyasu Ishida. Ishida previously released the
one-man project *Rain Town* in 2011, and he’s also got [a Pixiv
page](http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=56398) if you’re into that kind
of thing.
