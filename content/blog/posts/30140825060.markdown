At this rate, Miyuki Sawashiro will be in every single show I’m watching
this season. She’s going to find *some* way to make it into *Natsuyuki
Rendezvous*. I just know it.

(Aside: What is it with noitaminA shows and running off to France?)

(Aside aside: Okay, maybe just *Nodame* and this. But still.)
