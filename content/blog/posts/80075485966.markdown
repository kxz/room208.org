It’s more than a little strange that Tumblr supports (well,
[“supports”](http://blog.room208.org/post/17756259414)) localization for
[theme content](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/localizing_themes), but
not for any [custom
variables](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes#appearance-options)
that you might define. I guess I just have to blindly hope that my
theme’s non-English-speaking users can all figure out what “Mobile
Styles Everywhere” means, instead of presenting the option text to them
in their own respective languages.

I guess those who cannot remember gettext are condemned to reimplement
it, poorly.
