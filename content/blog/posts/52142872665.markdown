[China Snuffs Out Discussion of
Tiananmen](http://kahimyang.info/kauswagan/history_current_events/1549-china_snuffs_out_discussion_of_tiananmen):
There’s a great symbolic irony in how, in trying to prevent netizens
from discussing the past, Chinese censors have blocked searches for
“today” and “tomorrow”. By preventing the public from looking back, they
are in essence clouding the present and future.

I’m sorry, that was accidentally serious.
