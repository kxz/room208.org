[Lies, damned lies, and
statistics](http://blog.room208.org/post/40124947004), part II.

This graph covers only anime with a regular TV airing, as defined by
AniDB, from which I pulled all of this data. Series are indexed by the
date of their premiere, naively sorted into season buckets in blocks of
three calendar months.

*Oreimo* aired in autumn 2010. Indeed, autumn has a pattern of having
longer titles in most years. What does that, or anything else about this
graph, tell us? You tell me.
