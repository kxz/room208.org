Multiple times this anime season, one quote has come to mind that I wish
the writers of even the best shows running would have kept closer to
their hearts. As Antoine de Saint Exupéry put it, “Perfection is finally
attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is
no longer anything to take away.”
