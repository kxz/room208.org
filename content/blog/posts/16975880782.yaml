description: <p>Kenji Nakamura&rsquo;s working on yet another noitaminA series. It&rsquo;s
  mildly surprising that he&rsquo;s back so soon, but what&rsquo;s even stranger is
  that this looks like a show about&hellip; high school boys who go fishing. Bet you
  weren&rsquo;t expecting that from the director of <cite>Mononoke</cite> &ndash;
  I suppose he&rsquo;s playing it safe after <cite>C</cite> ended up being too ambitious
  for its own good. Atsuya Uki of <cite>Cencoroll</cite> fame is doing the character
  designs. Now all that&rsquo;s left is to figure out what exactly that duck is all
  about.</p>
