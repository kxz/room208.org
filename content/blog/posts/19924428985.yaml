  for having a plot with the strength of wet tissue and characterization that takes
  more 180-degree turns than a mountain highway, but I can&rsquo;t justify the effort
  to myself. That&rsquo;s fine by me, because I think there&rsquo;s one image from
  the final episode&rsquo;s closing credits that adequately represents everything
  wrong with the series:</p>

  <p>Hare. She spends the first half of the series, like pretty much all of the characters,
  being mostly inconsequential to the plot. She wasn&rsquo;t fleshed out nearly enough
  to make her death have any emotional impact, but it still catalyzes Shu&rsquo;s
  over-the-top change into an unsubtle tyrant. Then she&rsquo;s mostly forgotten about
  until the end of the series, while Shu goes on and on about Inori having been the
  only person who was &ldquo;there&rdquo; for him through thick and thin. Her story
  gets wrapped up with a single shot of a birthday cake with her name on it, which
  screams &ldquo;token gesture from the writers to reassure you that we didn&rsquo;t
  forget about her, oh no!&rdquo; The sad thing is that I actually kind of liked her
  character. At least she died before she could get dragged through the mud like Arisa.
  Yes, let&rsquo;s go and turn our ineffectual but sympathetic leader into a star-struck
  traitor willing to sleep around for information. That makes total sense.</p>


  <p>I was hoping around the midpoint of the series that someone would throw a real
  wrench into the story and turn it into something less generic. After all, Hiroyuki
  Yoshino did the screenplay for <cite>Mai-HiME</cite>, too, and that started off
  as a mostly unremarkable show before it pulled off a masterful twist into dark character
  drama halfway through. I realize now that I should have been more specific in my
  wishes &ndash; while <cite>Guilty Crown</cite>&rsquo;s second half certainly isn&rsquo;t
  generic, that&rsquo;s only because it&rsquo;s its very own brand of terrible.</p>


  <p>(The animation <em>was</em> pretty. I&rsquo;ll give it that.)</p>'
