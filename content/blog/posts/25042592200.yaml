body: '<p>Dear Tumblr,</p>


  <p>It would be really nice if your <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/goodies">backup
  application for Mac</a> actually worked. You know, as in not failing with a vague
  &ldquo;API error&rdquo; nine out of ten times I try to use it, or claiming to succeed
  while silently failing to back up any of my answer posts, or claiming to succeed
  while silently failing to back up <em>anything at all</em>. Here&rsquo;s a tip:
  If a hacked-together recursive wget is easier and more convenient than your custom-built
  program, something is very, very wrong. And don&rsquo;t give me that &ldquo;beta&rdquo;
  garbage. Most betas are at least functional.</p>
