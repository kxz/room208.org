Takanori Aki of Good Smile Company and Hiroaki Matsuura of Sanzigen talk
about the 3D CG process used in <cite>Black Rock Shooter</cite> on last
week’s edition of the NHK World program
[<cite>imagine-nation</cite>](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/tv/imagine/archive201201270800.html).
The refinements shown here do seem blindingly obvious in hindsight, but
I’m glad to see them starting to make their way into the mainstream.
