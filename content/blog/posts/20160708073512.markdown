1.  As you might imagine, given that the game was primarily developed
    for the 3DS and Vita, the system requirements [listed on
    Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/311240/) are overkill. I
    mean, 8 GB RAM? A GTX 650 or HD 7700 with 1 GB VRAM at minimum? It
    was almost playable in a VirtualBox instance that requires software
    emulation of DirectX 11! I’d guess most any computer released in the
    past three years, and even some older ones, should be able to run
    *Zero Time Dilemma* with few issues. Just turn down the resolution
    and antialiasing if you run into problems.

2.  Speaking of settings, the game’s launcher is a Node.js app using the
    Electron framework. Seems like overkill for something that’ll only
    ever run on Windows, doesn’t it? Hmm.

3.  There are a few UI artifacts indicating the game’s origin as a
    handheld console port, most visibly the mentions of hardware buttons
    on the menu screens. Since the 3DS supports stylus input, which
    translates well to a mouse, the mildly lazy conversion doesn’t hurt
    gameplay that much. It’s a little irritating to have to use the
    on-screen keyboard for puzzles that require text input, though.

4.  Much hay has been made of *Zero Time Dilemma*’s introduction of
    random elements to the typical visual novel choice system, but I
    suspect that they’re not in fact all that random. I’d love to hear
    from anyone who doesn’t get the dice roll in exactly three attempts,
    for instance. Yeah, when you know what the odds would actually be,
    they sure *feel* awfully hopeless, but it’d be pretty stupid for the
    game to insist on adhering to them.

5.  Did somebody say something about Miyuki Sawashiro? No? Oh. I just
    thought… well. Another time, maybe. *clears throat*

6.  Really, the most jarring thing about *Zero Time Dilemma*, coming
    from the first two games in the *Zero Escape* series, is the shift
    to fully-3D cutscenes. It’s a far more demanding mode of
    presentation than the models of *Virtue’s Last Reward*, which
    animated a small palette of gestures and nothing else, let alone the
    visual novel–style 2D sprites from *Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine
    Doors*. Unfortunately, *Zero Time Dilemma*’s visuals hint that the
    budget wasn’t increased to match. This is especially noticeable in
    the PC version, where the low-resolution textures and plasticky
    character animations stick out like a sore thumb.

7.  Which is a real shame, because Rui Tomono did a great job with
    reinterpreting the character designs for this final game in the
    trilogy. They do lose the more baroque fluorishes of Kinu
    Nishimura’s work from the first two installments, but that’s in
    keeping with the generally more subdued mood of *Zero Time Dilemma*.
    Gone are the moments of calm that housed comedic bits like Junpei’s
    cat-related verbal tic. It shows that Koutarou Uchikoshi has learned
    how to preserve the sense of urgency throughout a story. Contrast
    this with the interludes of chicken sandwiches and kick-the-can
    games in *Ever17* — though the newfound seriousness can occasionally
    get rather suffocating.

8.  Between the replacement of visual novel narration with cutscenes and
    the leaner plot, *Zero Time Dilemma* cuts a third to a half off the
    playtime of *Virtue’s Last Reward*. It’s hard not to feel a little
    disappointed by how the game pulls back on throwing revelations out
    of left field, even though it makes sense for the last game in a
    series like this one — *especially* this one — to try and wrap up
    all of the loose ends it’s introduced. Still, the basic framework of
    an Uchikoshi story hasn’t changed: you get yourself very confused,
    and in doing so you manage to save the lives of all of the main
    characters. It doesn’t even merit a spoiler warning at this point,
    but I’m fine with that. The journey is what counts.
