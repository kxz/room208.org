This is a quick-and-dirty English translation of [a contemporary fantasy
setting idea](http://hanatuki.syoyu.net/Entry/1/) originally [posted to
Pixiv](http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?illust_id=33998060&mode=medium)
in Japanese by @[thykgn](https://twitter.com/thykgn). I’m doing this
because it’s necessary background for a separate Pixiv comic that I’m
looking to do a translation of on Danbooru.

I do apologize in advance for how stupid some of the phrasings sound;
that’s entirely my fault, not the original author’s.

## Setting

Contemporary fantasy.

The world has a little more greenery than it does now. This is a story
of the flowers who seek *the best fertilizer*, so that flowers more
beautiful than any other may blossom; and the people who abandon their
remaining lives in order to obtain something greater.

After tree-planting was instituted into law, “enhanced” plants began to
appear, and competition for survival among the various flowers turned
fierce. At that point, the powerful abilities that the flowers held
inside them began to manifest – the flowers tempted humans in despair
with this exchange: In return for *allowing one’s remaining human life
and body to be taken*, they would receive *the power to satisfy one
final wish through their connection to the flowers*. The world’s flowers
became ever more brilliant and beautiful, but people thought of it as
merely the result of the earlier “enhancements.” Nor did anyone realize
what was causing the increased number of human disappearances.

The title mentions “spring,” but this setting can be used in any place
or season.

If you upload drawings or other images to Pixiv, I’d be happy if you
could tag them with “Spring and the Flower Possessions”
(<span lang="ja">春と花憑き</span>).

Please send anything else to @[thykgn](https://twitter.com/thykgn).

The logo’s not all that fancy, but feel free to use it as you wish.

I got some questions about this: I don’t plan on doing further work on
this on Pixiv for the time being (neither for a project, nor for the
characters and setting), so feel free to put up character and setting
drafts and contributions!

## Character types

-   *Possessed:* Those who have been taken by the flowers. In exchange
    for offering their remaining lives and their bodies, they have been
    given one exceptional ability. Their bodies crumble like ash after
    their sacrifice, and become nourishment for the flowers, while the
    possessed themselves become like ghosts. A flower either grows from,
    or replaces a part of, their body. The flower starts out as
    something foreign, but after a short time can become like part of
    the body. The possessed cannot stray more than a few meters from the
    plant that has power over them, and should the plant wither they too
    will die. Flowers of annuals are short-lived, and therefore grant
    extraordinarily strong powers; if the possessor is a perennial, the
    possessed may hibernate during the winter, thereby extending their
    lives. Flowers of trees are longer-lived, and therefore only grant
    weaker powers.

-   *Protectors:* Those who protect flowers. Each has his or her own
    reason for doing so. There is no penalty for allowing a flower under
    one’s protection to die. On the other hand, there is no real benefit
    to protectors, even if they accompany a possessed person until his
    or her wish can be granted. They may borrow powers from possessed
    people with deeply-rooted greenery. Unlike the possessed, they may
    separate from their plants, and can even still use their powers;
    however, their powers grow weaker with distance. When using their
    powers, tattoos in the form of flowers appear on their bodies.

-   *Devourers:* Those who eat flowers. Each has his or her own reason
    for doing so. There are those who use methods of defoliation with
    the aim of destroying all of the possessed, and who are opposed by
    those who side with the possessed and become protectors. Others want
    to see a particular possessed person gone. Devourers do not
    literally eat flowers. There are fellowship-like organizations for
    devourers, but since there are many lone actors, membership is not
    high.

-   *Researchers:* Those who do the research to “enhance” flowers. Their
    numbers include those who wish to support flowers and become
    protectors, those who fall to despair and become possessed, and
    those who see the dangers of flowers and become devourers, as well
    as others. There are many who love flowers from the heart, and set
    their minds on research.
