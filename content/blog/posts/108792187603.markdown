I’m a Tumblr theme developer. I have various bug reports and feature
requests that I’d like to send in, not least regarding [my continued
inability to edit my theme’s
description](http://blog.room208.org/post/79772827394). Tumblr’s
official venue for discussion of the theme API is [a Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/tumblr-themes) that has been dead
for months, and was rarely trafficked by Tumblr devs even before it
died. So, readers: Do I have any recourse for getting things fixed,
beyond [complaining a
lot](https://github.com/tumblr/ios-extension-issues) and hoping someone
notices?
