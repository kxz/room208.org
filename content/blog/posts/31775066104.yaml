  <p>Three reasons <em>Humanity Has Declined</em> deserves your attention:</p>


  <ul><li><p><strong>Wit.</strong> In a medium where appreciation of irony often seems
  at a premium, <em>Humanity Has Declined</em> stands head and shoulders above with
  its bracingly open satire. In the course of just twelve episodes, the show sets
  its sardonic sights on consumerism, manga culture, corporate hierarchy, government,
  religion, and more. This is not an anime that pulls its punches.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Whimsy.</strong> You might think using three-inch-tall, permanently
  smiling fantasy creatures as a primary plot driver is strange enough, but that&rsquo;s
  by no means the limit of Romeo Tanaka&rsquo;s imagination. Try skinned chickens
  falling like manna from the heavens as the <em>Ave Maria</em> echoes in the background.
  Try a sentimental homecoming between two anthropomorphized space probes. Try the
  rise and fall of entire fairy civilizations in twenty minutes. I could go on.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Stellar voice acting.</strong> <em>Humanity Has Declined</em> wouldn&rsquo;t
  be half the show it is without Mai Nakahara, who knows exactly how to sell the protagonist&rsquo;s
  deadpan humor. The rest of the cast is nothing to scoff at, either. Miyuki Sawashiro
  turns in an almost predictably excellent performance as Y, while the various fairy
  voices serve as a perfect mix of saccharine innocence and morbid darkness.</p></li>

  </ul><p>9/10. This is show of the year material.</p>'
