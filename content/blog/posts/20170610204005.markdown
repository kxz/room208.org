So one day I was sitting around, thinking that *Monogatari Series* seems
to have one of the most useless main characters, well, ever. In terms of
making his friends’ lives better, at least, even if he is a premier
source of banter and horrifying losses of bodily integrity. In fact,
Araragi seems to be the *source* of his friends’ troubles more often
than not.

Well, what better way to test this hypothesis than with numbers? We’ll
give Araragi one point for every arc where the solution wouldn’t have
happened without him, and take one away in each case where the problem
et cetera as above. I’ll go in anime order.

Araragi introduces Senjougahara to Oshino. Let’s give him some credit.

<td colspan="3" markdown="span">
None of the arc would happen without Araragi skulking around the park
trying to avoid his family, and Hachikuji finally gets home and stops
being so angry. Yes, Araragi isn’t very helpful when it comes to
actually _finding_ the place, but let’s not nitpick.

Not only would there be no problem in the first place but for Araragi,

You could loosely argue that Nadeko’s infatuation with Araragi is an
indirect cause of the conflict, but it’s not essential.

See _Suruga Monkey_, above, except replace “new girlfriend” with “new

Araragi’s basically the sole reason Hachikuji sticks around for so long,

This arc is just the tail end of Nadeko Medusa. Though it’s tempting,
it’s not really fair to penalize Araragi for the same thing twice.

This arc is a pretty clear victory for Araragi. Well, if you ignore

Hm. Uh… well, guess I was right.
