body: <p>I thought I&rsquo;d start blogging about more bloggy things. I&rsquo;ve moved
  a bunch of old posts to <a href="https://room208.org/eggshell/">Eggshell</a>. You
  can thank me for sparing you the labor of working through Tumblr&rsquo;s terrible
  archive navigation. Eventually, everything I think is worth keeping will get migrated
  over there, where it&rsquo;ll live until I move it all again in a few months.</p>
