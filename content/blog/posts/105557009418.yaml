  <p>I&rsquo;m no stranger to writing about disappointing (or just <a href="http://blog.room208.org/post/19924428985">outright
  poor</a>) anime, so I thought I&rsquo;d shake things up a bit by pausing to look
  on the bright side&hellip; after taking a moment to vent about all the bad parts.</p>


  <h2>The gray cloud</h2>


  <p>I don&rsquo;t often find myself wishing a sequel were just a retread of the original,
  but such is the case with me and <em>Psycho-Pass 2</em>. After a promisingly suspense-filled
  start, the new series proceeds to descend straight into a philosophical and narrative
  mishmash, reducing the elaborately constructed setting into little more than set
  pieces for a poorly-thought-out revenge story.</p>


  <p>The plot is much the same as the first time around: In a slightly dystopian sci-fi
  Tokyo, law enforcement decisions are made on the basis of an on-the-spot psychological
  evaluation, and our protagonist, Public Safety Bureau Inspector Akane Tsunemori,
  must contend with a threat that somehow evades this system&rsquo;s judgment, blah
  blah, you know the drill. In fact, the second season utterly fails to escape from
  the territory already well worn by its predecessor. What few new elements it does
  bring to the table often contradict the series&rsquo; established logic, sometimes
  even common sense. Try to forget, for instance, the fact that the PSB&rsquo;s weapons,
  dependent as they are on cloud-computed assessments of mental state, should logically
  have a remote kill switch that can be activated when lost.</p>


  <p>But even these lapses of thought would be forgivable if <em>Psycho-Pass 2</em>
  hadn&rsquo;t completely forgotten to bring along some of the character development
  that made the first season so memorable. None of the new characters have any surprises
  in store for the viewer; a glance at the first few episodes gives you all the information
  you need to guess where each one ultimately ends up, assuming they&rsquo;re not
  unceremoniously killed off halfway through. Akane herself is reduced from calm and
  level-headed &ndash; a hard-earned badge after all she went through as a rookie
  &ndash; to distressingly unemotive. It&rsquo;s almost too easy to lay this at the
  feet of writer Tow Ubukata, who replaced Gen Urobuchi for the sequel, especially
  when <em>Psycho-Pass 2</em> tries to cover its shortcomings with the same pointlessly
  gory action and intimations of body horror that his earlier <em>Mardock Scramble</em>
  did. Not even the direction of Naoyoshi Shintani, who stayed on for the second season,
  can save the show from Ubukata&rsquo;s most over-the-top excesses.</p>


  <h2>The silver lining</h2>


  <p>I could say that the best part of this whole ordeal is that Urobuchi is back
  in the driver&rsquo;s seat for the upcoming <em>Psycho-Pass</em> film, which will
  hopefully be a more proper follow-up <a href="http://blog.room208.org/post/84717187433">along
  the lines of his earlier sequels</a>, but that wouldn&rsquo;t really be fair. While
  <em>Psycho-Pass 2</em>&rsquo;s plot is a mess, though, its presentation is as slick
  as ever, especially when it comes to its theme songs. Ling Tosite Sigure&rsquo;s
  blisteringly unhinged rock has always been a perfect fit for the franchise, and
  their new opening &ldquo;Enigmatic Feeling&rdquo; is no exception. It&rsquo;s hard
  for any ending to compete, but EGOIST, everyone&rsquo;s favorite semi-fictional
  refugee from the <em>Guilty Crown</em> universe, turns in an admirable if somewhat
  disjointed effort with &ldquo;Fallen.&rdquo; It wouldn&rsquo;t be too far off the
  mark to say that the music was the sole reason I kept tuning in week after week
  once the content of <em>Psycho-Pass 2</em> itself went south.</p>


  <p>Well, in any case, onwards to the movie! It hits theaters in Japan three weeks
  from now, which of course means that I won&rsquo;t get a chance to see it until
  2027.</p>'
