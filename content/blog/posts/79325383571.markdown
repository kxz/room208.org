I’m the onee-channiest onee-chan to ever onee-chan God’s green earth.

But in all seriousness, selector specificity is only half the story
here. Boring historical explanation follows for the rest of this
paragraph: The fact that this still works is really something of an
accident having to do with the `[src*="o.html"]` attribute selector. I
originally put that in there to keep these rules from over-matching and
glomming onto the control banner for mobile devices, which has a
separate iframe URL and considerably different appearance. Tumblr’s own
selector used to only have the frame ID and class, but now also has
`html body` in front of it in what I presume is an attempt to keep
themes from overriding the buttons’ placement. Fortunately for us,
[attribute selectors are considered more specific than element
selectors](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#specificity), so all this
still works.

The other big, important aspect is that all of Dichotomy’s CSS rules
regarding the Tumblr controls frame are defined with `!important`.
Tumblr defines all of *its* rules (namely `position` and `top`) with
`!important`, so unless we add that to our rules as well, we’ll get
overridden even though our selector is more specific than theirs.

I really wish Tumblr had the sense to treat things like this as parts of
their theming API that are documented like anything else. (And for that
API to be versioned. Can we get some [semver](http://semver.org/) up in
here?) Until then, it’s hack after hack after hack to “fix” things that
shouldn’t be broken in the first place.
