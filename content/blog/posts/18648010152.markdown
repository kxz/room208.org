I’m becoming more and more convinced with every episode of <cite>Black
Rock Shooter</cite> that the writers managed to paint themselves into a
corner about halfway through the series. Unsure of how to satisfactorily
resolve the tangled mess of plot threads that they’d created, and too
far deep in the production schedule to simply junk everything and start
from scratch, they decided to abandon all pretense of narrative
coherence and just go for brazen surrealism and emotional manipulation.
After all, if the show’s “real world” is just a carefully prepared lie,
who’s to say that all the obvious inconsistencies aren’t intentional?
It’s like someone took <cite>Lost</cite> and decided to cram its basic
structure into eight episodes. I can’t even bring myself to be angry
that they’re doing this, because it’s actually working – if they tell me
the story doesn’t matter any more, I’ll just let them pelt me with
pretty pictures ’til the cows come home. This is <cite>Guilty
Crown</cite> made by people willing to admit that they just can’t write
an epic. Goddammit.
