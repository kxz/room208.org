Those of you who know me know that I’m not a huge fan of reblogged
posts, so I usually hide them from my dashboard. Sometimes, though, I
want to take a peek at their contents. I was playing around with some
custom CSS and arrived at the following:

    .not_mine.is_reblog {
        opacity: 0.1;
        overflow: hidden;
        max-height: 20px !important;
        -moz-transition: all 0.5s linear;
        -webkit-transition: all 0.5s linear;
        transition: all 0.5s linear;
    }

    .not_mine.is_reblog:hover {
        opacity: 1;
        max-height: 10000px !important;
    }

<del>There’s a `transition` rule for general posts already, so all I need
to do is override the default styles and styles on hover.</del>
\[<ins>**Edit:** Tumblr changed the dashboard style sheets to no longer
provide a transition by default. I’ve added the appropriate code
above.</ins>\] It’s functional *and* pretty. Win-win!
