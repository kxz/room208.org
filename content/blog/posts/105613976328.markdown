The selection of Neutral Milk Hotel’s contradictory “Holland, 1945” for
the [end
credits](http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/p2s8rc/sign-off---from-eternity)
of the final episode – sonically upbeat, yet lyrically a grim contention
with death – makes a lot of sense in this light.

Meanwhile, Paul Krugman, who was part of the [massive studio
chorus](http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/964kg3/stephen---friends----we-ll-meet-again-)
singing “We’ll Meet Again” along with Mr. Colbert, [reveals that there
really was a conspiracy all along,
