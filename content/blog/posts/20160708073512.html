<li><p>As you might imagine, given that the game was primarily developed
for the 3DS and Vita, the system requirements <a href=
"http://store.steampowered.com/app/311240/">listed on Steam</a> are
overkill. I mean, 8 GB RAM? A GTX 650 or HD 7700 with 1 GB VRAM at
minimum? It was almost playable in a VirtualBox instance that requires
software emulation of DirectX 11! I’d guess most any computer released
in the past three years, and even some older ones, should be able to run
<em>Zero Time Dilemma</em> with few issues. Just turn down the
resolution and antialiasing if you run into problems.</p></li>

<li><p>Speaking of settings, the game’s launcher is a Node.js app using
the Electron framework. Seems like overkill for something that’ll only
ever run on Windows, doesn’t it? Hmm.</p></li>

<li><p>There are a few UI artifacts indicating the game’s origin as a
handheld console port, most visibly the mentions of hardware buttons on
the menu screens. Since the 3DS supports stylus input, which translates
well to a mouse, the mildly lazy conversion doesn’t hurt gameplay that
much. It’s a little irritating to have to use the on-screen keyboard for
puzzles that require text input, though.</p></li>

<li><p>Much hay has been made of <em>Zero Time Dilemma</em>’s
introduction of random elements to the typical visual novel choice
system, but I suspect that they’re not in fact all that random. I’d love
to hear from anyone who doesn’t get the dice roll in exactly three
attempts, for instance. Yeah, when you know what the odds would actually
be, they sure <em>feel</em> awfully hopeless, but it’d be pretty stupid
for the game to insist on adhering to them.</p></li>

<li><p>Did somebody say something about Miyuki Sawashiro? No? Oh. I just
thought… well. Another time, maybe. <em>clears throat</em></p></li>

<li><p>Really, the most jarring thing about <em>Zero Time Dilemma</em>,
coming from the first two games in the <em>Zero Escape</em> series, is
the shift to fully-3D cutscenes. It’s a far more demanding mode of
presentation than the models of <em>Virtue’s Last Reward</em>, which
animated a small palette of gestures and nothing else, let alone the
visual novel–style 2D sprites from <em>Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine
Doors</em>. Unfortunately, <em>Zero Time Dilemma</em>’s visuals hint
that the budget wasn’t increased to match. This is especially noticeable
in the PC version, where the low-resolution textures and plasticky
character animations stick out like a sore thumb.</p></li>

<li><p>Which is a real shame, because Rui Tomono did a great job with
reinterpreting the character designs for this final game in the trilogy.
They do lose the more baroque fluorishes of Kinu Nishimura’s work from
the first two installments, but that’s in keeping with the generally
more subdued mood of <em>Zero Time Dilemma</em>. Gone are the moments of
calm that housed comedic bits like Junpei’s cat-related verbal tic. It
shows that Koutarou Uchikoshi has learned how to preserve the sense of
urgency throughout a story. Contrast this with the interludes of chicken
sandwiches and kick-the-can games in <em>Ever17</em> — though the
newfound seriousness can occasionally get rather suffocating.</p></li>

<li><p>Between the replacement of visual novel narration with cutscenes
and the leaner plot, <em>Zero Time Dilemma</em> cuts a third to a half
off the playtime of <em>Virtue’s Last Reward</em>. It’s hard not to feel
a little disappointed by how the game pulls back on throwing revelations
out of left field, even though it makes sense for the last game in a
series like this one — <em>especially</em> this one — to try and wrap up
all of the loose ends it’s introduced. Still, the basic framework of an
Uchikoshi story hasn’t changed: you get yourself very confused, and in
doing so you manage to save the lives of all of the main characters. It
doesn’t even merit a spoiler warning at this point, but I’m fine with
that. The journey is what counts.</p></li>
