  <p><em>Kokoro Connect</em>&rsquo;s first three arcs, the ones that made up its original
  television run, had a single recurrent, frustrating problem that loomed over all
  else. Now, to the show&rsquo;s credit, it was one brought on by doing something
  well. I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I initially brushed the series off after
  reading the short preview blurb; after all, you and I and everyone we know have
  seen <em>Freaky Friday</em> already, so why would we need an anime version? Fortunately,
  <em>Kokoro Connect</em> managed to break out of being simple formula, partly by
  extending the antics of main antagonist Heartseed beyond mere body-swapping, but
  also by doing an excellent job of establishing its characters and the emotional
  ups and downs that Heartseed&rsquo;s actions put them through. Once it was done
  with the setup, though, the <em>problem</em> reared its ugly head &ndash; towards
  the end of each arc, when the show actually had to untangle the dramatic knots it
  had so eagerly tied itself in, it found that it didn&rsquo;t even know where to
  begin, and as such the resulting conclusions came off as contrived and distinctly
  unsatisfactory. The first arc ended with a forced intervention from Heartseed, who
  explained it away as the result of boredom, and the second and third arcs tried
  to change the subject and hope viewers didn&rsquo;t notice.</p>


  <p>Well, the good news is that <em>Kokoro Connect</em> figured out how to break
  out of this vicious cycle in its final arc, which resolves its emotional tensions
  via a much simpler route: lots of cathartic outbursts, which seems doubly appropriate
  for an arc that revolves around the main characters having the secrets they kept
  from each other forced out into the open. The bad news is that the writers don&rsquo;t
  seem to have realized that this means that they don&rsquo;t need to add a dramatic
  twist at the end. While it&rsquo;s something that can ultimately be ignored without
  detracting from the arc&rsquo;s sense of closure, the unnecessary turn is outlandish
  enough to overshadow some of the positive aspects of the show&rsquo;s final episode,
  including a romantic conclusion that strives for an odd nuance I haven&rsquo;t seen
  since <em>True Tears</em>.</p>


  <p>In the end, if I had to judge <em>Kokoro Connect</em> on how it matched up to
  my expectations going in, I have to say it blew them away, mostly because I didn&rsquo;t
  really give it a fair shake at first. If I had to rate it on the goals that it seemed
  to set up for itself, though, I&rsquo;d have a much harder time saying that it succeeded.
  Maybe the best way to put it is that it failed gracefully, which might not be so
  bad after all.</p>'
