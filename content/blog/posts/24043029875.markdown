From the authors:

> In these two books, the authors of four dozen open source applications
> explain how their software is structured, and why. What are each
> program’s major components? How do they interact? And what did their
> builders learn during their development? In answering these questions,
> the contributors to these books provide unique insights into how they
> think.

A fascinating read, especially when it comes to looking at applications
that I myself use. The deeply-thought-out designs, like LLVM’s, are
educational in and of themselves, but it’s also fun to see how programs
that didn’t start out so well-architected have been forced to evolve
over time to meet new demands. (MediaWiki, I’m looking at you.)
