Kenji Nakamura’s working on yet another noitaminA series. It’s mildly
surprising that he’s back so soon, but what’s even stranger is that this
looks like a show about… high school boys who go fishing. Bet you
weren’t expecting that from the director of <cite>Mononoke</cite> – I
suppose he’s playing it safe after <cite>C</cite> ended up being too
ambitious for its own good. Atsuya Uki of <cite>Cencoroll</cite> fame is
doing the character designs. Now all that’s left is to figure out what
exactly that duck is all about.
