I was hoping for a beautiful marine goddess, but Urara’s close enough.
From *Tsuritama* episode 12, which by the way was a terrific ending to
what is possibly the best series of the season. It’s definitely a solid
8 in my books, maybe even a 9. I can’t say I was expecting a show about
four high school boys who fish together to have such a memorable cast or
epic storytelling. Am I ever glad I was wrong.
