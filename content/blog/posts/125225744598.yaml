  <ol><li><p>You might remember that the second season of the <em>Psycho-Pass</em>
  TV series was <a href="http://blog.room208.org/post/105557009418">basically narratively
  inconsequential</a>. Since its release schedule suggests that it was being worked
  on in parallel with this movie, I&rsquo;ve long suspected that this was a deliberate
  decision by the writers to keep plot contradictions from popping up. The film does
  nothing to disabuse me of this notion, since it seems content to proceed as if virtually
  all of <em>PP2</em> never happened. Which is perfectly fine by me, since the behavior
  of the Sibyl System is core to the movie&rsquo;s plot, and <em>PP2</em> made it
  too subject to the whims of individuals to be truly menacing.</p></li>

  <li><p>Speaking of which, fansubbers, it&rsquo;s spelled S-i-b-y-l. As in, you know,
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibyl">Sibyls</a> of Greek myth. Not
  S-y-b-i-l. The correct spelling is onscreen more than once, for crying out loud.</p></li>

  <li><p>There is a lot of badly-pronounced English in the movie, which isn&rsquo;t
  really necessary. I suppose it&rsquo;s a reasonable choice of language for a multinational
  union of Southeast Asian countries, but it&rsquo;s still a little hard to sit through
  the Japanese voice actors&rsquo; middling inflections. I&rsquo;m keeping my fingers
  crossed for an official version that splices together the Japanese and English dubs,
  though even then they&rsquo;ll all sound like Americans and not real Cambodians
  or Thais or Malaysians or what have you. Oh, well.</p></li>

  <li><p>EGOIST&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nameless Beasts&rdquo; really is a great song.</p></li>

  <li><p>Mika, Akane&rsquo;s junior colleague as Inspector, still has her air of superiority
  about her, but given that she only has a handful of lines in the movie, I&rsquo;m
  willing to forgive the lack of development. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the awful
  way she was handled in <em>PP2</em>, I doubt many people would give her behavior
  here a second thought. The rest of the characters introduced by the previous season
  basically only exist as extras, which isn&rsquo;t much of a change from before,
  come to think of it. Maybe a third TV series would do them some good.</p></li>

  <li><p>There&rsquo;s a lot packed into the film&rsquo;s 114-minute runtime, and
  as a result some major plot threads are resolved only hurriedly in the end, perhaps
  a consequence of the definite tilt towards explosive action sequences and visceral
  hand-to-hand fights. This is nowhere near the triumph that Gen Urobuchi&rsquo;s
  earlier work on <a href="http://blog.room208.org/post/84717187433"><em>Madoka: Rebellion</em></a>
  was. Still, though, the movie manages to do what <em>PP2</em> couldn&rsquo;t and
  extend the world to a new setting, new characters, and new conflict. We learn much
  more about what the Sibyl System was designed to protect its citizens against. We
  realize that systems, like humans, seek their own survival. And we feel that slight
  allegorical twinge, as if the contradiction of violence for peace were an important
  question on the minds of Japanese viewers right this very moment.</p></li>

  <li><p>Seven is a great number to end on, don&rsquo;t you think?</p></li>
