Spoilers for <cite>Analogue</cite>’s endings after the break.

<% render '/blog/_more.haml' do %>

@[fioradorable](http://fioradorable.tumblr.com/), [on the game’s
\*Hyun-ae
endings](http://fioradorable.tumblr.com/post/20341434899/analogue-a-hate-story):

> <cite>Digital: A Love Story</cite>’s protagonist – who’s practically
> invisible, by design! – has an unspecified gender. S/he can be whoever
> you imagine and the game doesn’t try to stop you from thinking that.
> This is extra important here because, in Digital, the protagonist *is
> you*. If halfway through, <cite>Digital</cite> suddenly went and
> pointed out the protagonist’s maleness, it would be rather jarring – a
> sudden recognition that the protagonist *isn’t* actually me, and
> perhaps that the game isn’t even intended for me! Fortunately,
> <cite>Digital</cite> avoided this.
>
> <cite>Analogue</cite> didn’t.
>
> It doesn’t have an excuse either, because \*Hyun-ae actually asked me
> my gender, to which I responded correctly! Yet, later in the story,
> she seems to forget this – first saying that she doesn’t know, and
> then blindly assuming again that I am male.
>

>
> “A good friend, except female.” … is the concept of a “good friend”
> default-male?
>
> This sort of thing happened periodically towards the ending, which
> honestly made it very anticlimactic, kicking out my emotional
> connection. Honestly, I expected Christine Love to be better than
> this.

Here’s where I wish <cite>Analogue</cite> had scene-by-scene replay like
<cite>Katawa Shoujo</cite>, because I’m likely to be proven wrong about
what I’m about to say, thus invalidating this entire post, thereby
making me look stupid and inarticulate on the Internet, heaven forbid
that ever happen *\*deep breath\** – but I don’t recall \*Hyun-ae asking
about the player’s gender. I know \*Mute inquires about it (and your
marital status, even) almost immediately after you reactivate her, since
she seems to need it to frame her interactions with you. \*Hyun-ae,
though, doesn’t really seem to care, even up to the point where you
download her core from the <cite>Mugunghwa</cite> to your ship.

In this context, the “good friend, except female” comment isn’t very
sensitive to the player’s gender, but I don’t think it’s a jarring break
of character. \*Hyun-ae is, despite everything that’s happened to her,
still essentially sixteen years old, and it’s pretty clear that she’s
injected a good bit of romantic fantasy into her perception of you.
After all, she still knows virtually nothing about you by this point, as
she repeatedly admits. Given that she’s apparently straight, she’s
probably going to conjure up a male mental image for her romantic
partner – I wouldn’t be surprised if she sees the player as a prince
come to save her from a life of protracted loneliness. Yes, she could
probably ask, like \*Mute does, but I think she’s so absorbed in her own
imagination that the thought doesn’t really occur to her. Consider it a
reflection of \*Hyun-ae’s character, not of the game’s assumptions.
