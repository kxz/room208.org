  <p>When the signal does come through, it&rsquo;s already been through something
  like ten or eleven repeaters, and we don&rsquo;t get the luxury of exact reproduction
  at any of those junctures. Even if the error rate at each hop were just one percent,
  after this many retransmissions, we&rsquo;d end up losing a tenth of the data. It&rsquo;s
  more like five percent, of course, and that means we have to cope with nearly half
  of the stream being in some garbled state when it finally gets to us.</p>


  <p>Working with this technology is like trying to reconstruct the Mona Lisa from
  a printout that&rsquo;s been through the wash. Twice.</p>


  <p>The engineers wanted to build a sophisticated error correction system to handle
  it all, but eventually even they gave up. We have enough data by now that we can
  basically guess at the overall patterns, anyway. I&rsquo;m sure the more empirically-minded
  lab members are throwing fits at this every night, but it&rsquo;s what keeps the
  funding coming in. High scientific ideals are one thing, but being able to feed
  myself and my girlfriend is another, and I don&rsquo;t let the former get in the
  way of the latter.</p>'
