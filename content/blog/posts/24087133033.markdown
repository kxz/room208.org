I almost didn’t pick up *Sankarea*, but I’m very glad I did, and the
show’s direction is part of the reason why – it’s taken an otherwise
unremarkable premise and lent it an unmistakable atmosphere. It turns
out director Shinichi Omata (working under a pseudonym) is an old hand
at SHAFT now working on his own projects, much like Shin Oonuma, and you
can see some of the techniques common to Akiyuki Shinbou and his
protégés here played in a more subtle, but still effective, manner.
