So I’m watching *Humanity Has Declined* (*Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita*),
and one character’s already committed suicide by the time the first
episode finishes.

Said character is an animatronic loaf of bread.

I don’t know what the hell I’m watching, but I like it.

(Lest you think the show is just trying to be wacky, there’s also a fair
bit of commentary on the Japanese political process and consumer culture
mixed in. Of course, it’s easy to miss in the face of baked goods
offering themselves for your consumption, Milliways-style.)
