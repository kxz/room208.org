Weekly anime I’m planning to follow this spring:

-   [<cite>Medaka Box</cite>](http://medakabox.jp/) (April 5). I’ve been
    hearing mixed reception from manga readers, based on the current
    previews, but I figure it can’t hurt to give more Nisio Isin a shot.

-   [<cite>Dusk Maiden of Amnesia</cite>](http://www.amnesia-tv.com/)
    (or <cite>Tasogare Otome × Amnesia</cite>; April 9). How this hit my
    radar in the first place, I can’t really remember, but apparently
    the source material is pretty solid. A lot of people were apparently
    expecting this to be a SHAFT adaptation – Shinbou’s old partner Shin
    Oonuma, now at Silver Link, is in fact taking the director’s chair
    on this one. Here’s to hoping that he can pull out of the long slide
    into mediocrity that he’s taken since his amazing work on the
    <cite>ef</cite> anime. Well, okay, <cite>BakaTest</cite> was all
    right.

-   [<cite>Boys on the Slope</cite>](http://www.noitamina-apollon.com/)
    (or <cite>Sakamichi no Apollon</cite>; April 12). The first of this
    season’s noitaminA shows, and boy, does it look to be a doozy. We’re
    talking Shinichirou Watanabe as director and Yoko Kanno as composer,
    a combination you might remember from <cite>Cowboy Bebop</cite>
    (and, if you were *really* paying attention, the wonderful
    <cite>Genius Party</cite> short “Baby Blue”). Unsurprisingly given
    the staff, it’s an anime about jazz in the sixties. I can’t see this
    being bad.

-   [<cite>Tsuritama</cite>](http://www.tsuritama.com/) (April 12).
    Kenji Nakamura’s back in noitaminA, and this time it looks like he’s
    turning the surrealism dial down a bit. [As I’ve
    mentioned](/post/16975880782), I suspect this may be his way of
    bouncing back from last year’s <cite>C</cite>, which was by all
    accounts a mess, with something a bit less ambitious and more
    relaxed. Atsuya Uki’s character designs do help with the latter.
