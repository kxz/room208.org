  <p>I&rsquo;ve found that the Disabato offense is quite weak to the Howlett interchange,
  especially on players who still aren&rsquo;t used to the 1995 amendments on hand

question: Let's play Mornington Crescent!  I'll start at South Wimbledon.  While I
  certainly wouldn't wish to reveal my whole strategy quite yet, I'll give at least
  a little hint -- remember it's a Tuesday, so the roundabout rules apply.  This lets
  me threaten a quick crossover through Bayswater into Redbridge via the green line.  The
  final step might be hard to spot though, so be cautious...!
