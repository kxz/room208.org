  be up to scratch. Bear with me.</p>


  <p>For the majority of visual novels, saves do not represent what we might ordinarily
  think of when we think of game save states: a self-contained snapshot of game progress.
  Progress is instead tracked globally, independent of any particular save. What most
  visual novels term &ldquo;saves&rdquo; are really composed of just two things: (1)
  a list of choices the player has made, and (2) the specific scene or line from which
  to resume gameplay. Choices made when resuming from one saved game often affect
  what&rsquo;s available when resuming from another. <em>Remember11</em> sticks out
  in my mind as one particularly infamous example of the confusion this causes, but
  this problem affects nearly all visual novels that use a traditional save system
  to some extent.</p>


  <p>The problematic nature of this abstraction is compounded by the fact that most
  visual novels don&rsquo;t provide a way to easily jump from one scene to another.
  Instead, the player is often expected to &ldquo;save&rdquo; before every major decision
  point, and resume from there should he or she have picked the wrong choice, or want
  100% completion, or need a refresher on what&rsquo;s happened since then. Forgot
  to save? Tough luck. You&rsquo;ll have to fast-forward through text you&rsquo;ve
  already seen in order to get back to where you were before, dragging yourself out
  of the game&rsquo;s narrative frame. This is a terrible user experience, and it&rsquo;s
  almost never one that&rsquo;s justified by narrative considerations. Unless the
  visual novel is itself about the drudgery of boring, repetitive tasks, in which
  case I question why anyone would feel the need to play it at all, this puts a completely
  unnecessary burden on the player.</p>


  <p>The whole metaphor around visual novel saves needs to be rearranged. Here&rsquo;s
  how I&rsquo;d like to see it:</p>


  <ul><li><p>Saves wholly encapsulate player progress. I should be able to play one
  save without accidentally changing what happens in another. A new game should be
  a new game, regardless of what I&rsquo;ve done in previous ones. &ldquo;New Game+&rdquo;
  options might, in cases where they&rsquo;re clearly delineated, be an exception.
  <em>Might.</em></p></li>

  <li><p>The player can freely, and easily, jump to any scene that&rsquo;s already
  been unlocked, without having to go through and play that path again. Just being
  able to replay a certain scene isn&rsquo;t good enough, because that carries no
  information about the choices the player has made. Various games provide a flowchart;
  the last one I played that did this was <em>Virtue&rsquo;s Last Reward</em>, which
  did a good job overall of avoiding this kind of save confusion. Visual novels that
  don&rsquo;t have a branching narrative, or that don&rsquo;t want to give away the
  importance of certain choices, can provide a simple summary ballot, where the user
  can say, all at once, &ldquo;I want to <strong>spend the afternoon with Asuna</strong>,
  then <strong>go to the park</strong>, and <strong>follow the stray kitten</strong>.&rdquo;
  There&rsquo;s always the option for players to go through old scenes in the traditional
  fashion, should they need a refresher.</p></li>

  <li><p>Finally, what used to be &ldquo;saves&rdquo; now become &ldquo;bookmarks&rdquo;
  that the player can create and name in order to quickly pick up with certain choices
  at a specific point. This is useful in case the player needs to consult the information
  there, such as in a mystery VN, or just has a favorite scene that he or she wants
  to file away and revisit in the future.</p></li>

  </ul><p>Okay, that&rsquo;s all. Have fun.</p>'
