  <p>It&rsquo;s clear from even a cursory viewing that a lot of talented people worked
  on <em>The Flowers of Evil</em>. The evidence of their presence is everywhere, not
  least in the show&rsquo;s excellent background art and music direction. Even the
  much-maligned decision to use rotoscoping as the basis of the show&rsquo;s animation
  at least indicated a willingness to think outside of the box. Unfortunately, <em>The
  Flowers of Evil</em> seems entirely too content to let these talents go to waste,
  squandering them with a chaotic, poorly-thought-out execution that too often strays
  into absurdity. Sure, I know there are production reasons for having a 19-year-old
  actor play the middle-school-age protagonist struggling with peculiarly middle-school-age
  problems, but they hardly make the end result any less bizarre to watch. On top
  of this, the show&rsquo;s core philosophical conflict, the one that you would hope
  would be compelling enough to justify the series&rsquo; persistently self-serious,
  humorless atmosphere, is delivered with the subtlety of a brick to the face. The
  plot delivers few real surprises, just a slow, predictable realization of the main
  cast&rsquo;s self-destructive tendencies. Only once or twice throughout did I feel
  like the show truly impressed, most particularly with a nighttime classroom scene
  towards the midpoint that might as well have been a trailer showing off what the
  animation and music teams could do with their unique approach. Otherwise, <em>The
  Flowers of Evil</em> is generally a muddle that seems to want to make a point before
  it quite understands what that point actually is.</p>'
