  <p>Thank you for adding this new &ldquo;sticky iframe&rdquo; that repositions itself
  with JavaScript whenever I scroll the page. Until now, I hadn&rsquo;t grasped why
  the blog controls needed to be at the top right of the viewport at all costs, but
  now I understand that that space is sacred. It belongs to you, and you alone!</p>


  <p>Just kidding. I <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kxz/dichotomy/compare/60b0c60..fe60d85#diff">modified
  two lines of CSS</a> in order to restore the original behavior, leaving the JavaScript
  that does iframe position checks twice every second functionally inert.</p>


  <p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://blog.room208.org/post/17756259414">theme localization
  is still fundamentally broken</a>, but who has the time to think about all that?</p>


  <p>Still, you know, these changes would bother me less, even annoying and unnecessary
  as they are, were they at least <em>documented</em> somewhere.</p>
