I thought I’d start blogging about more bloggy things. I’ve moved a
bunch of old posts to [Eggshell](https://room208.org/eggshell/). You can
thank me for sparing you the labor of working through Tumblr’s terrible
archive navigation. Eventually, everything I think is worth keeping will
get migrated over there, where it’ll live until I move it all again in a
few months.
