**EGOIST, “Nameless Beasts”** (“Namae no Nai Kaibutsu”; *Psycho-Pass*
ED). This is the first EGOIST song I’ve heard where I’ve felt Chelly’s
vocals really *click*; there’s a sultriness to the chorus that was
lacking in her previous outings and that fits well with *Psycho-Pass*’
darker atmosphere. The single will be out on December 5.

**Suneohair, “Slow Dance”** (*Say “I love you.”* ED). This one’s already
been released as a single; the guitar here is a bit reminiscent of “Red
Coat” from the second season of *Arakawa Under the Bridge*.

**Risa Taneda (as Saki Watanabe), “Split Apple”** (“Wareta Ringo”; *From
the New World* ED). There’s no release date announced on this yet, which
makes me think that a full version of the song won’t show up until the
soundtrack is released. Which is a shame, because its stuttering guitar
line and overlapping vocals are a real treat.
