  <p>It may have a lot of flowers, but <em>Natsuyuki Rendezvous</em> is not a pretty
  show. I&rsquo;m not talking about the visuals, of course; the technical execution
  is fluent enough to make discussion superfluous. No, the ugliness lies in the characters
  and the story built around them, one that&rsquo;s rent with jealousy, dishonesty,
  and selfishness.</p>


  <p>This dark, cynical view of romance is actually refreshing, in a way &ndash; a
  mature acknowledgment that well-intentioned misunderstandings don&rsquo;t even begin
  to cover the depths to which human relationships can plunge. <em>Natsuyuki Rendezvous</em>
  simply makes its point a little <em>too</em> well. It does a good job of showing
  how flawed its main cast can be, but often forgets to balance the negative with
  a little of the positive. Even if the intent is to illustrate that love isn&rsquo;t
  the panacea that it&rsquo;s often cast as, it&rsquo;s hard to take this lesson in
  stride when the characters seem drawn towards their own destruction from the outset.
  The heart of the story, after all, kicks into action when one side of the central
  love triangle gets himself drunk, then in a fit of self-loathing agrees to let the
  ghost of his beloved&rsquo;s dead former husband take over his body. It takes him
  nearly the entire series to realize that this might not have been such a good idea.</p>


  <p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to condemn <em>Natsuyuki Rendezvous</em>&rsquo;
  characters as bad people. On a logical level, their words and actions make sense
  to me, given their respective histories. On an emotional level, though, the series
  veers dangerously close to making them impossible to relate to, something that never
  bodes well for a romantic story. It&rsquo;s this division that leaves me rather
  ambivalent about the show as a whole. If you want a quantitative verdict, I&rsquo;ll
  give it a 6 of 10, but more so than usual, I don&rsquo;t think a number is nearly
  representative enough.</p>'
