I literally just (as in, within the past hour or so) bought myself a
copy of <cite>[Analogue: A Hate Story](http://ahatestory.com/)</cite>,
Christine Love’s latest visual novel. I loved <cite>Digital</cite> and
thought <cite>don’t take it personally, babe</cite> was… well, at least
an admirable effort, insert nervous laugh here, so I figured \$15 wasn’t
too much to ask for another round at the table.

Lest you think I’m a total capitalist sell-out, I will note that I
blatantly ignored the instructions you see above and installed it in my
own personal games folder instead of /Applications. Take *that*,
spiffy-looking disk image background!

More thoughts later when I actually start, you know, playing the game.
