A small HTTP server that lets you easily craft diabolical responses,
like one that sends 50 random bytes, pauses for six seconds, sends
another 50, pauses again, sends a final 2 KB, then terminates the
connection. Those of you who have noticed my recent struggles with
[Omnipresence](https://bitbucket.org/kxz/omnipresence)â€™s URL sniffing
functionality will understand why something like this is a testing
godsend.
