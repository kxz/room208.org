  <h2>Character types</h2>\n\n<ul><li><p><em>Possessed:</em>\nThose who have been\
  \ taken by the flowers.\nIn exchange for offering their remaining lives and their\
  \ bodies, they have been given one exceptional ability.\nTheir bodies crumble like\
  \ ash after their sacrifice, and become nourishment for the flowers, while the possessed\
  \ themselves become like ghosts.\nA flower either grows from, or replaces a part\
  \ of, their body.\nThe flower starts out as something foreign, but after a short\
  \ time can become like part of the body.\nThe possessed cannot stray more than a\
  \ few meters from the plant that has power over them, and should the plant wither\
  \ they too will die.\nFlowers of annuals are short-lived, and therefore grant extraordinarily\
  \ strong powers; if the possessor is a perennial, the possessed may hibernate during\
  \ the winter, thereby extending their lives.\nFlowers of trees are longer-lived,\
  \ and therefore only grant weaker powers.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Protectors:</em>\n\
  Those who protect flowers.\nEach has his or her own reason for doing so.\nThere\
  \ is no penalty for allowing a flower under one&rsquo;s protection to die.  On the\
  \ other hand, there is no real benefit to protectors, even if they accompany a possessed\
  \ person until his or her wish can be granted.\nThey may borrow powers from possessed\
  \ people with deeply-rooted greenery.\nUnlike the possessed, they may separate from\
  \ their plants, and can even still use their powers; however, their powers grow\
  \ weaker with distance.\nWhen using their powers, tattoos in the form of flowers\
  \ appear on their bodies.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Devourers:</em>\nThose who eat flowers.\n\
  Each has his or her own reason for doing so.\nThere are those who use methods of\
  \ defoliation with the aim of destroying all of the possessed, and who are opposed\
  \ by those who side with the possessed and become protectors.  Others want to see\
  \ a particular possessed person gone.\nDevourers do not literally eat flowers.\n\
  There are fellowship-like organizations for devourers, but since there are many\
  \ lone actors, membership is not high.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Researchers:</em>\n\
  Those who do the research to &ldquo;enhance&rdquo; flowers.\nTheir numbers include\
  \ those who wish to support flowers and become protectors, those who fall to despair\
  \ and become possessed, and those who see the dangers of flowers and become devourers,\
  \ as well as others.\nThere are many who love flowers from the heart, and set their\
  \ minds on research.</p></li>\n</ul><h2>Resources</h2>\n\n<p><em>[All of the following\

    \ taken by the flowers.\nIn exchange for offering their remaining lives and their\
    \ bodies, they have been given one exceptional ability.\nTheir bodies crumble\
    \ like ash after their sacrifice, and become nourishment for the flowers, while\
    \ the possessed themselves become like ghosts.\nA flower either grows from, or\
    \ replaces a part of, their body.\nThe flower starts out as something foreign,\
    \ but after a short time can become like part of the body.\nThe possessed cannot\
    \ stray more than a few meters from the plant that has power over them, and should\
    \ the plant wither they too will die.\nFlowers of annuals are short-lived, and\
    \ therefore grant extraordinarily strong powers; if the possessor is a perennial,\
    \ the possessed may hibernate during the winter, thereby extending their lives.\n\
    Flowers of trees are longer-lived, and therefore only grant weaker powers.</p></li>\n\
    <li><p><em>Protectors:</em>\nThose who protect flowers.\nEach has his or her own\
    \ reason for doing so.\nThere is no penalty for allowing a flower under one\u2019\
    s protection to die.  On the other hand, there is no real benefit to protectors,\
    \ even if they accompany a possessed person until his or her wish can be granted.\n\
    They may borrow powers from possessed people with deeply-rooted greenery.\nUnlike\
    \ the possessed, they may separate from their plants, and can even still use their\
    \ powers; however, their powers grow weaker with distance.\nWhen using their powers,\
    \ tattoos in the form of flowers appear on their bodies.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Devourers:</em>\n\
    Those who eat flowers.\nEach has his or her own reason for doing so.\nThere are\
    \ those who use methods of defoliation with the aim of destroying all of the possessed,\
    \ and who are opposed by those who side with the possessed and become protectors.\
    \  Others want to see a particular possessed person gone.\nDevourers do not literally\
    \ eat flowers.\nThere are fellowship-like organizations for devourers, but since\
    \ there are many lone actors, membership is not high.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Researchers:</em>\n\
    Those who do the research to \u201Cenhance\u201D flowers.\nTheir numbers include\
    \ those who wish to support flowers and become protectors, those who fall to despair\
    \ and become possessed, and those who see the dangers of flowers and become devourers,\
    \ as well as others.\nThere are many who love flowers from the heart, and set\
    \ their minds on research.</p></li>\n</ul><h2>Resources</h2>\n\n<p><em>[All of\
