Glad to help!

As far as I’m aware, there’s no way to do this. Allowing author changes
incautiously could cause real problems – a malicious user could make
someone else the author of an unflattering post, or take authorship of a
good one. It’s also possible that Tumblr’s code assumes that the
currently logged-in user is the one posting in enough places to make
implementing author changes a headache. Arguably, if you’re a blog
admin, you should still have the power to change authorship among the
members of that blog, but until Tumblr explicitly announces such a
feature, don’t hold your breath.
