Some observations about the name “<cite>Analogue: A Hate Story</cite>”
in typical spoiler-filled fashion after the jump.

<% render '/blog/_more.haml' do %>

So, what’s in a name?

1.  We see analog(ue) technology as less modern, a regression from
    digital, hinting at the backwardness of the <cite>Mugunghwa</cite>’s
    society.

2.  The game’s story is an allegory – or analogue – for the historical
    Joseon dynasty, especially in its repressive treatment of women.

3.  \*Hyun-ae, we find out, was actually born human, though we’re led to
    believe at first that she’s never been anything but an AI. This is a
    reversal of the situation in <cite>Digital</cite>, where \*Emilia is
    an AI that we initially believe to be human.

4.  The player has to **ana**lyze **log**s to discover what happened
    aboard the <cite>Mugunghwa</cite>. (There also happens to be [some
    software for generating Web site access
    statistics](http://analog.cx/) that uses this same pun, modulo
    English spelling variations.)

The “hate” part is pretty clear. I don’t think that needs explanation.
