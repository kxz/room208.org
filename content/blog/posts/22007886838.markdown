Misaki’s new best friend, from *Tsuritama* episode 3.

I was going to make another image of *Kids on the Slope*’s Sentarou
talking about his pigeon “girlfriend” (which he named after [Sarah
Vaughan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Vaughan)), but that doesn’t
GIF quite so well. I really just wanted an excuse to make some [*Hatoful
Boyfriend*](http://www.dlsite.com/eng/work/=/product_id/RE091090.html)
jokes, anyway, so maybe it’s better that I didn’t.
