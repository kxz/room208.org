Imagine you’re walking down the street, and you run into a large crowd
all gazing and pointing at a nearby building. “A huge fire broke out
over there,” you hear someone say in hushed tones. “I heard the whole
place is gutted, inside and out,” another person whispers. “Who could
have done such a thing?” a third person asks in horror.

You look up and see a perfectly intact building. People are walking in
and out of the entrances like normal, not a fire truck is in sight, and
there’s absolutely no sign that anything’s amiss.

This is what reading discussion about *Free!* has been like so far.
