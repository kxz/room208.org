body: '<p>So <a href="http://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway</a>&rsquo;s the latest of
  these web-based language analyzers to come on the scene, claiming to provide easy
  identification of stylistic weaknesses in prose. Here are a few hints: If it marks
  down entire parts of speech, like Hemingway does adverbs, it&rsquo;s probably useless.
  If on top of that it misidentifies words like <em>frilly</em>, <em>lively</em>,
  and <em>lovely</em> as adverbs based on their suffixes, it&rsquo;s definitely useless.
  If <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=10416">it thinks <em>teh</em>
  (sic) repeated 31 times is good prose</a>&hellip; well, you can figure that one
  out for yourself.</p>


  <p>I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t expect much from a webapp that frequently advises
  you to use &ldquo;0 or fewer&rdquo; adverbs, though.</p>'
