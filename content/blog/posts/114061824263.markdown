Ask and ye shall receive: Iâ€™ve updated [the
guide](http://blog.room208.org/post/110389527808) with some screenshots
from Chrome as a visual reference. If you still run into trouble, some
of the required post fields, as covered in [the original version of the
tutorial](http://blog.room208.org/post/64244275772), may be empty. Try
rearranging the JSON fields if necessary, and when all else fails, look
at the contents of the AJAX response object for error messages.
