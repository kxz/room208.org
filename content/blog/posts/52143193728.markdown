[Startup founders vs
Entrepreneurs](http://swombat.com/2013/6/4/startup-founders-vs-entrepreneurs):
The former want to do cool things, while the latter want to achieve
business and financial goals. The two sets aren’t mutually exclusive,
but you can be forgiven for believing that they are. Meanwhile, it’s
still hard to read “one billion dollars” in anything other than Dr.
Evil’s voice.
