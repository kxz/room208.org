I’m feeling up to a little creative challenge, and my inbox has been a
bit empty lately, so I’m putting up a limited promotion: I’ll write some
[keyboard-mash
fiction](http://blog.room208.org/tagged/keyboardmashfiction) based on
the third question I get [through Tumblr](http://blog.room208.org/ask)
after I make this post. Hell, if you ask a good question, I’ll try to
answer it regardless – but only the third one gets a story, you hear?
I’ve already got a tab with the Muses.
