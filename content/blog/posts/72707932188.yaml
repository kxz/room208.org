  <p>This graph covers only anime with a regular TV airing, as defined by AniDB, from
  which I pulled all of this data. Series are indexed by the date of their premiere,
  naively sorted into season buckets in blocks of three calendar months.</p>


  <p><em>Oreimo</em> aired in autumn 2010. Indeed, autumn has a pattern of having
  longer titles in most years. What does that, or anything else about this graph,
  tell us? You tell me.</p>'
