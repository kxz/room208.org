[Lies](http://blog.room208.org/post/40124947004), [damned
lies](http://blog.room208.org/post/72707932188), and statistics, part
III.

This graph is based on data for the 770 broadcast TV anime that AniDB
lists as both starting and ending between January 1, 2009, and December
31, 2014, inclusive. Lest you think Iâ€™m exaggerating with the title of
this post, the correlation coefficient for that linear regression line
is 0.0107. Existent, I guess.
