  <hr><p>Remember how *Hyun-ae tries to give you the opportunity to introduce yourself
  when you first log on to the ship&rsquo;s computers?</p>


  <p><img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m35zjbducf1qhcb4p.png" alt=""/></p>


  <p>Unfortunately, millennia of isolation have apparently left her language parsing
  facilities in an unusable state, and she eventually abandons free text input for
  the binary questions that you use to interact with her and *Mute for the rest of
  the game. Mechanics-wise, they&rsquo;re no different from any old visual novel choice
  system &ndash; you still move your mouse cursor onto an option and click to proceed.
  The critical nuance is that the AIs, <em>in story</em>, are providing you with both
  the questions and the answers, and that means that the choices give you some insight
  into the way they think.</p>


  <p>Take the little interrogation that you get from *Mute after you first boot her
  up. If you tell her that you&rsquo;re female and unmarried, she goes on to ask you
  this:</p>


  <p><img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3613f7pqh1qhcb4p.png" alt="*Mute:
  &quot;So how old are you, then?&quot; Options: &quot;I''m under 18&quot; / &quot;I''m
  an old lady&quot;"/></p>


  <p>She does look and act young enough for this to be a throwaway joke on her part,
  but in the context of the <cite>Mugunghwa</cite>&rsquo;s neo-Joseon society, it&rsquo;s
  evident that her choice of possible answers means more than that, and the logs&rsquo;
  various references to women getting married in their early teens back this up. In
  fact, the oldest bride mentioned on the family trees, Heo Min-jung, was just 18
  or 19 years old on her wedding day. *Mute clearly seems to expect that women be
  married by the time they hit their twenties, and there&rsquo;s no way to tell her
  otherwise.</p>


  <p>Here&rsquo;s another, subtler example. On *Hyun-ae&rsquo;s paths, if you tell
  her that the two of you have no chance of being together (romantically), she pleads
  with you to just download her core and free her from the loneliness of deep space:</p>


  <p><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m362qoE9AV1qhcb4p.png" alt="*Hyun-ae:
  &quot;Please?&quot; Options: &quot;I''ll take you&quot; / &quot;No&quot;"/></p>


  <p>Note how much gentler the first choice&rsquo;s wording is. It&rsquo;s plausible
  that this is a deliberate choice on *Hyun-ae&rsquo;s part to discourage you from
  picking the other option, by turning it into an uncomfortably blunt one-word response.
  She didn&rsquo;t need to persuade me, of course, but those more cautious about bringing
  along someone with her history might yet be subconsciously swayed to her side by
  the dichotomy she presents. Given that she&rsquo;s facing a potential eternity of
  isolation if she fails, I don&rsquo;t blame her for playing some mind games.</p>


  <p>Freedom of expression, and the limitations placed on it by society and individuals
  alike, form one of <cite>Analogue</cite>&rsquo;s major themes. We see this writ
  large in the logs, from the numerous merely unsent letters to the horrible abuse
  Hyun-ae&rsquo;s parents exact on her. In a way, by calling attention to how it puts
  its own restrictions on your interactions with the characters, the game brings this
  idea closer to home for us as the players &ndash; the medium forms part of the message.</p>'
