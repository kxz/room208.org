  <p><em>Wolf Children</em> is simply breathtaking. I don&rsquo;t know what to say
  about it other than that director Mamoru Hosoda takes the best of his previous film
  work &ndash; <em>The Girl Who Leapt Through Time</em>&rsquo;s emotional resonance,
  <em>Summer Wars</em>&rsquo; sense of discovery and adventure &ndash; and adds to
  that an ambition and scale easily on the level of three or four lesser films. It
  may be 160 minutes long, but the deftness and maturity on display make the movie
  worth every minute. Go see it.</p>'
