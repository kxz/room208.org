Slow decay, or playing around with Inkscape’s path simplification tool.
“13” was simplified as part of a text node containing all the numbers
from “01” to “13”; the other numbers were then deleted. The same goes
for “12”, “11”, and so on down to “01”, which was simplified by itself.
As more discontinuous paths are selected, the shape changes more and
more radically as the algorithm attempts to beat the entire selection
into something smooth.
