**Protagonist density:** The *Tachibana*, named after *Amagami*’s lead,
who incidentally has the density of a block of lead. Marked by a general
obliviousness, especially when it comes to romance, and a tendency to
think with the wrong head.

**Incredulity:** The *Araragi*, for *Bakemonogatari*’s main character
and reaction face generator extraordinaire. This could have been named
for a good few of Hiroshi Kamiya’s other characters, really.

**Moeblobbiness:** The *Asahina*, for *Haruhi*’s mascot. I don’t think I
need to explain how this one works.
