For those of you readers who are drinking the weekly anime release
Kool-Aid, what shows are you all planning to watch in the upcoming
winter season?

Here’s my list:

-   *Sasami-san@Ganbaranai* – Obligatory SHAFT show.

-   *Chihayafuru 2* – Obligatory josei show. That and the original was
    one of the best shows to grace the airwaves last year.

-   *Minami-ke Tadaima* – The *Omatase* OVA showed promise, and I’m
    still laboring under the illusion that *Minami-ke* might once again
    reach the heights of its first series.

-   *Robotics;Notes* and *Psycho-Pass* – Hangers-on from the fall. I’ve
    been tempted now and again to drop the former, but I just haven’t
    been able to bring myself to do so.

(Yes, every show but one is a continuation or sequel. Deal with it.)
