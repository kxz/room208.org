Tumblr oughta love this, part 3:

> An animated gif is a magical thing. It contains the power to convey
> emotion, empathy, and context in a subtle way that text or emoticons
> simply can’t.
>
> GIFGIF is a project to capture that magic with quantitative methods.
> Our goal is to create a tool that lets people explore the world of
> gifs by the emotions they evoke, rather than by manually entered tags.

This one’s another time-wasting-for-science project out of the MIT Media
Lab. Ars Technica has [more
