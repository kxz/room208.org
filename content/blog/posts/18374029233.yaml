  tool. &ldquo;13&rdquo; was simplified as part of a text node containing all the
  numbers from &ldquo;01&rdquo; to &ldquo;13&rdquo;; the other numbers were then deleted.
  The same goes for &ldquo;12&rdquo;, &ldquo;11&rdquo;, and so on down to &ldquo;01&rdquo;,
  which was simplified by itself. As more discontinuous paths are selected, the shape
  changes more and more radically as the algorithm attempts to beat the entire selection
  into something smooth.</p>
