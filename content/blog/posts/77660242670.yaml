  <p>When I went back to Landry the next day, the smell of charred electronics was
  still lingering in the air.  I&rsquo;d nicked the air freshener that had been sitting
  on the counter of my hotel bathroom in the hopes of masking the odor, but even with
  the station&rsquo;s interior ventilation on full blast, nothing really helped.  Lacking
  for better options, I found myself leaning over and sticking my nose into the fragrance
  cartridge every so often as I pored through Landry&rsquo;s logs and computer code
  on one of its sleek, glossy terminals.</p>


  <p>The damage had been minimal this time, thankfully, limited to one network switch
  that was simply swapped out for a spare.  Sabina was positively beaming at the small
  scope of the trouble.  &ldquo;Maybe things are starting to look up,&rdquo; she said
  as she passed by my workstation.  &ldquo;Nothing blew up this time, right?  Does
  this count as threat mitigation?&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;It counts if you&rsquo;re willing to take the credit for it,&rdquo; I
  said, not bothering to take my eyes away from the screen.</p>


  <!-- more -->


  <p>&ldquo;Oh, perfect.  I can submit this for my next performance review.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;You guys have performance reviews?&rdquo;  I scrunched my face in distaste,
  not at Sabina&rsquo;s response but at a particularly inscrutable line of diagnostic
  output.</p>


  <p>&ldquo;We do now that I have something to brag about,&rdquo; Sabina said, with
  a chuckle.</p>


  <p>&ldquo;And meanwhile I&rsquo;m the one sitting in front of the computer&hellip;&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who volunteered for it.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to regret doing that,&rdquo; I said sullenly.  &ldquo;Spending
  all my time up at Sudalis doing nothing made me forget just how much of a pain debugging
  is.  It&rsquo;s not worth it, I&rsquo;m telling you.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;Not even for the bonus?&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;Not unless that bonus is&hellip;&rdquo;  I flicked my eye to the clock
  in the corner of the monitor.  &ldquo;Four hours of my life back.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>I finally removed my hands from the keyboard and put them behind my head, leaning
  back in the chair in exasperation.  An upside-down image of Sabina&rsquo;s cheerful
  face greeted me in return.</p>


  <p>&ldquo;Taking a break?&rdquo; she asked.</p>


  <p>&ldquo;No.  I&rsquo;ve figured out what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;Yeah.  But, uh, before I tell you&hellip;&rdquo;  I spun the office chair
  around so that I no longer had to crane my neck to look at Sabina.  &ldquo;I have
  to ask, who wrote the station&rsquo;s legacy message handling component?&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be me.  Why do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>


  <p>I felt my breathing get a little shallower.  Diplomacy was not exactly my strong
  point.  &ldquo;Um, uh, well, I just wanted to &ndash; uh &ndash;&rdquo;</p>


  <p>Sabina laughed.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just kidding.  Some contractors ported over
  the control software from the old station setup.  Let me guess, it sucks.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>I sighed in relief.  &ldquo;Yeah.  It&rsquo;s terrible.  I&rsquo;m surprised
  this entire station didn&rsquo;t burn down long before you got here.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer to explain what isn&rsquo;t, because that list&rsquo;s
  a lot shorter.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;I had a feeling.&rdquo;  Sabina shook her head as she dragged a nearby
  chair up next to me.  Sitting down, she nudged me over so she could get a good look
  at the screen.  &ldquo;Lay out the scene for me.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>I mimed my head exploding, complete with the sound of a bomb burst.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  about the long and the short of it.  There&rsquo;s buffer overflows, missed bounds
  checks, stale pointers,&rdquo; I said, ticking each of the items off on my fingers
  as I went, &ldquo;and on top of that the source code comments are composed entirely
  of out-of-context movie quotes.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;That last one&rsquo;s worthy of the gallows.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say.  Anyway, what&rsquo;s really stupid is that none of this
  would matter if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that the clown does some really extreme
  stuff with the comms signal.  The messages are padded with a bunch of random noise
  that&rsquo;s <em>barely</em> within the specs.  As bad as this code is, it&rsquo;d
  handle pretty much every normal message fine.  The ones from the clown, though&hellip;
  the control computer&rsquo;s memory will turn to garbage faster than you can say&hellip;
  uh&hellip;&rdquo;  I trailed off, losing my train of thought.  &ldquo;Help me out
  here.  What&rsquo;s, like, a clown catchphrase?&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me.  I always thought clowns were really creepy.  Besides,
  aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be the clown expert?&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t remind me.&rdquo;  I slumped over in my chair, defeated.</p>


  <p>Sabina stared at me in bemused silence for a moment.  Finally, with a voice of
  mildly sarcastic concern, she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send the drone around with
  some coffee, okay?&rdquo;</p>'

    \n<p>The damage had been minimal this time, thankfully, limited to one network\
    \ switch that was simply swapped out for a spare.  Sabina was positively beaming\
    \ at the small scope of the trouble.  \u201CMaybe things are starting to look\
    \ up,\u201D she said as she passed by my workstation.  \u201CNothing blew up this\
    \ time, right?  Does this count as threat mitigation?\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CIt\
    \ counts if you\u2019re willing to take the credit for it,\u201D I said, not bothering\
    \ to take my eyes away from the screen.</p>\n\n[[MORE]]\n\n<p>\u201COh, perfect.\
    \  I can submit this for my next performance review.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CYou\
    \ guys have performance reviews?\u201D  I scrunched my face in distaste, not at\
    \ Sabina\u2019s response but at a particularly inscrutable line of diagnostic\
    \ output.</p>\n\n<p>\u201CWe do now that I have something to brag about,\u201D\
    \ Sabina said, with a chuckle.</p>\n\n<p>\u201CAnd meanwhile I\u2019m the one\
    \ sitting in front of the computer\u2026\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CYou\u2019re the\
    \ one who volunteered for it.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CI\u2019m beginning to regret\
    \ doing that,\u201D I said sullenly.  \u201CSpending all my time up at Sudalis\
    \ doing nothing made me forget just how much of a pain debugging is.  It\u2019\
    s not worth it, I\u2019m telling you.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CNot even for the bonus?\u201D\
    </p>\n\n<p>\u201CNot unless that bonus is\u2026\u201D  I flicked my eye to the\
    \ clock in the corner of the monitor.  \u201CFour hours of my life back.\u201D\
    </p>\n\n<p>I finally removed my hands from the keyboard and put them behind my\
    \ head, leaning back in the chair in exasperation.  An upside-down image of Sabina\u2019\
    s cheerful face greeted me in return.</p>\n\n<p>\u201CTaking a break?\u201D she\
    \ asked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201CNo.  I\u2019ve figured out what\u2019s going on.\u201D\
    </p>\n\n<p>\u201CReally?\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CYeah.  But, uh, before I tell you\u2026\
    \u201D  I spun the office chair around so that I no longer had to crane my neck\
    \ to look at Sabina.  \u201CI have to ask, who wrote the station\u2019s legacy\
    \ message handling component?\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CThat\u2019d be me.  Why do\
    \ you want to know?\u201D</p>\n\n<p>I felt my breathing get a little shallower.\
    \  Diplomacy was not exactly my strong point.  \u201CUm, uh, well, I just wanted\
    \ to \u2013 uh \u2013\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Sabina laughed.  \u201CI\u2019m just kidding.\
    \  Some contractors ported over the control software from the old station setup.\
    \  Let me guess, it sucks.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>I sighed in relief.  \u201CYeah.  It\u2019\
    s terrible.  I\u2019m surprised this entire station didn\u2019t burn down long\
    \ before you got here.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CSo what\u2019s wrong?\u201D</p>\n\
    \n<p>\u201CI\u2019d prefer to explain what isn\u2019t, because that list\u2019\
    s a lot shorter.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CI had a feeling.\u201D  Sabina shook her\
    \ head as she dragged a nearby chair up next to me.  Sitting down, she nudged\
    \ me over so she could get a good look at the screen.  \u201CLay out the scene\
    \ for me.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>I mimed my head exploding, complete with the sound of\
    \ a bomb burst.  \u201CThat\u2019s about the long and the short of it.  There\u2019\
    s buffer overflows, missed bounds checks, stale pointers,\u201D I said, ticking\
    \ each of the items off on my fingers as I went, \u201Cand on top of that the\
    \ source code comments are composed entirely of out-of-context movie quotes.\u201D\
    </p>\n\n<p>\u201CThat last one\u2019s worthy of the gallows.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201C\
    I\u2019d say.  Anyway, what\u2019s really stupid is that none of this would matter\
    \ if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the clown does some really extreme stuff\
    \ with the comms signal.  The messages are padded with a bunch of random noise\
    \ that\u2019s <em>barely</em> within the specs.  As bad as this code is, it\u2019\
    d handle pretty much every normal message fine.  The ones from the clown, though\u2026\
    \ the control computer\u2019s memory will turn to garbage faster than you can\
    \ say\u2026 uh\u2026\u201D  I trailed off, losing my train of thought.  \u201C\
    Help me out here.  What\u2019s, like, a clown catchphrase?\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201C\
    Don\u2019t ask me.  I always thought clowns were really creepy.  Besides, aren\u2019\
    t you supposed to be the clown expert?\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CPlease, don\u2019\
    t remind me.\u201D  I slumped over in my chair, defeated.</p>\n\n<p>Sabina stared\
    \ at me in bemused silence for a moment.  Finally, with a voice of mildly sarcastic\
    \ concern, she said, \u201CI\u2019ll send the drone around with some coffee, okay?\u201D\
