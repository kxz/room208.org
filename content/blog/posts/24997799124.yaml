    \ a bit agitated.  \u201CNothing at all?\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CNo.  The only thing\
    \ I can think of is that his anniversary is coming up, but he\u2019s never taken\

    </p>\n\n<p>The woman flinched slightly, as if Peter were about to deal her a physical\

    <p>Travis wanted, at that moment, to be looking at anything but what he was seeing
    then.  It wasn&rsquo;t that the logs on his screen were long and dry &ndash; well,
    yes, they were, but that was something he was used to looking at day in and day
    out.  No, this was anything but boring, and not in a good way.</p>


    <p>&ldquo;Javier,&rdquo; Travis called over to the other side of the office.  It
    was already past 6:00, and most everyone else had already cleared out of the networking
    cluster.  &ldquo;Could you look at this?  I want to make sure I&rsquo;m reading
    this right.&rdquo;</p>


    <p>Unlike his remaining co-worker, Javier still seemed to have some life in him.  He&rsquo;d
    been at this job for three years already, but you couldn&rsquo;t tell by looking;
    he still had the energy of someone who hadn&rsquo;t even yet graduated from college.  It
    was that cheerful innocence that enabled him to walk over to Travis&rsquo; desk
    with an excited smile, oblivious to the hint of dread in his colleague&rsquo;s
    summons.</p>


    <p>&ldquo;This server,&rdquo; Travis said, pointing to a highlighted entry on
    his screen.  He paused for a moment, snapping his fingers as if they were the
    ignition to his idling brain.  &ldquo;Sterling oh-eight here&hellip; that&rsquo;s
    an encrypted file storage node in Houston, right?&rdquo;</p>


    <p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s high clearance,&rdquo; Javier
    added, in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>


    <p>Travis&rsquo; finger slid further down the line of text on his monitor, stopping
    underneath the name of the transmission protocol.</p>


    <p>&ldquo;So unencrypted network traffic leaving it would be&hellip; very bad?&rdquo;</p>


    <p>He threw a glance in Javier&rsquo;s direction, seeking confirmation for what
    his strangled intonation indicated he already knew.</p>


    <p>Javier, however, seemed largely unfazed by the news.  He simply responded to
    Travis&rsquo; question with another.</p>


    <p>&ldquo;Wait, where&rsquo;s the other end of that connection?&rdquo;</p>
