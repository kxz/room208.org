Whoa, look at that shiny “3”! This version of Dichotomy introduces:

-   A “left-handed” layout option that switches the placement of posts
    and navigation.

-   Refined mobile styles, and the option to always turn them on
    regardless of device.

-   Fixes for the “never miss another post” teaser, and code to suppress
    the whole-page sliding one.

-   A rewritten, slightly less pedestrian README.

-   Magic fairy dust.
