  <p>Observations from episode 4 of <cite>Nisemonogatari</cite>:</p>


  <ol><li><p>I didn&rsquo;t quite know how Maaya Sakamoto was going to work her new
  role, but she absolutely nailed it: mischievous, devilish, exactly the kind of disturbingly
  seductive you&rsquo;d expect from someone with the appearance Shinobu had before

  sound like in <cite>Kizumonogatari</cite>.</p></li>
