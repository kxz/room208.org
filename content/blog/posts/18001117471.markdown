Two points:

1.  The “School Days” wording is actually standard here, or at least
    widespread, as is the specificity of the times listed, which I
    believe are set down by law at some level.

2.  From [last week’s <cite>Wait, Wait… Don’t Tell Me!</cite> Lightning
    Round](http://www.npr.org/2012/02/18/147079871/lightning-fill-in-the-blank):

3.  Of course, we could avoid most of this by using an LED sign that’s
    only visible when the turn restriction is in effect, like those
    found at intersections near railroad crossings. Those are cool.

4.  I can’t count.
