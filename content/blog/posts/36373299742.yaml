body: '<h2>1.0pre</h2>


  <p>After his plans for a new version of Royal Space Force get the kibosh, Hideaki
  Anno drowns his sorrows with a guy from King Records. He happens to come back home
  having just reached the Ballmer Peak. Struck by drunken inspiration, Anno bashes
  out the initial implementation of Evangelion while heavily intoxicated.</p>


  <h2>1.0alpha1</h2>


  <p>Sometime in 1994, Anno is finally happy enough with his work to put down an official-sounding
  version number. The ending is still a stub, but he figures he&rsquo;ll get around
  to it eventually.</p>


  <h2>1.0alpha2 through 1.0alpha5</h2>


  <p>Resource leaks at Gainax, as well as some nutcases with bags of sarin, force
  Anno to perform several rewrites throughout 1995. Despite these setbacks, he remains
  confident in his progress, and announces a public beta will open in October.</p>


  <h2>1.0beta1 (codename &ldquo;Television Series&rdquo;)</h2>


  <p>First public release. Though he wants to release further alphas before opening
  up the code, Anno can&rsquo;t bear to let his earlier schedule slip, and ultimately
  pushes out a beta in October as promised. Despite the unfinished ending implementation
  still lingering from the early alphas, Evangelion becomes wildly popular upon its
  release, and is incorporated into a large number of core anime libraries.</p>


  <h2>1.0beta2 (&ldquo;Death and Rebirth&rdquo;); 1.0rc1 (&ldquo;End&rdquo;)</h2>


  <p>Anno succumbs to scope creep, and goes back to add new features. He finally implements
  an ending in 1.0rc1, released in 1998, though he&rsquo;s not quite happy with it.</p>


  <h2>1.0rc2 (&ldquo;Revival&rdquo;)</h2>


  <p>Anno rolls in a few patches to fix lingering bugs, and promises that 1.0 is just
  around the corner.</p>


  <h2>That whole period between 1998 and 2006</h2>


  <p>The project sits abandoned on SourceForge. Anno, in an apparent fit of boredom,
  moves on to writing new software, while downstream maintainers accumulate growing
  patchsets in an attempt to rectify Evangelion&rsquo;s worst inconsistencies.</p>


  <h2>1.0</h2>


  <p>Anno sends the first message to the evangelion-announce mailing list in eight
  years, giving a 2007 release date for Evangelion 1.0 as if nothing had happened.
  Furthermore, he moves Evangelion onto a rapid release schedule, promising 2.0 and
  further versions in six-month rolling cycles, with a completely rewritten ending
  to arrive in 4.0.</p>


  <h2>1.01</h2>


  <p>To no one&rsquo;s surprise, Anno pushes back 2.0&rsquo;s release date to summer
  2009. In the interim, he puts out a maintenance release in April 2008.</p>


  <h2>1.11</h2>


  <p>Version 1.1 never sees the light of day, thanks to an April Fool&rsquo;s Day
  hoax in <em>Newtype</em> involving a vacuum cleaner and an Asuka body pillow. Anno
  instead numbers the next release 1.11, which just adds to the confusion. Only later
  does he realize &ldquo;1.2&rdquo; might have been clearer.</p>


  <h2>2.0</h2>


  <p>I run out of software development jokes.</p>'
