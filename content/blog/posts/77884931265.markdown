So Tumblr added @-mentions not too long ago.

Here’s what you type into the WYSIWYG editor:

    @abandonmentprobability

It gets displayed as:

> [abandonmentprobability](http://blog.room208.org/)

If you switch to HTML mode, the markup looks like (without newlines):

    <a class="tumblelog">
        abandonmentprobability
    </a>

Unless you save the post first, in which case you get:

    <a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/msgaYTlPKdo0sLlHh4mXlOg">
        abandonmentprobability
    </a>

If you try to use an @-mention in plain text or Markdown mode,
meanwhile, the resulting markup is:

    @abandonmentprobability

Notice anything missing? To get a proper link, you actually have to use
(again, sans newlines):

    <a class="tumblelog">
        abandonmentprobability
    </a>

But be careful when you try to quote that markup in your post, because
if you don’t escape it somehow, it’ll get transformed into:

    <a class="tumblelog" href="http://tmblr.co/msgaYTlPKdo0sLlHh4mXlOg">
        abandonmentprobability
    </a>

Even in the middle of an indented Markdown code block.

Seriously, get it together, guys.
