  <p><em>Kids on the Slope</em>, briefly: Started out well, hit some rough patches
  around the ninth or tenth episode, never really recovered. <strong>(Plot details
  follow.)</strong> There were some moments in the middle of the series that recalled
  the swirling romantic complications of <em>Honey and Clover</em>, but once Yurika
  and Junichi left the scene, things got a bit too rushed and melodramatic for my
  taste. The school festival happened, Sentarou got in a car accident, and then <em>eight
  years</em> passed by &ndash; and all the while the main relationships between Kaoru,
  Sentarou, and Ritsuko seemed to go virtually nowhere, or even regress. I do dislike
  &ldquo;<em>x</em> years later&rdquo; endings in general, but this one in particular
  just seemed too easy. On the positive side, the music was (of course) good, and
  coupled with the best animation of &ldquo;live&rdquo; performances I&rsquo;ve yet
  seen. Again, a series that&rsquo;s hard to fault on the technicals. Probably a solid
  7.</p>'
