I [crossgraded](https://wiki.debian.org/CrossGrading) the entire
userspace of my Debian 7.7 server from 32- to 64-bit this morning,
because

-   I’d been [running a mostly 32-bit userspace on top of a 64-bit
    kernel](https://www.linode.com/docs/migrate-to-linode/disk-images/switching-to-a-64bit-kernel)
    for a while to take advantage of the Linode service upgrades that
    became available earlier this year, but that was starting to cause
    problems, including

-   an inability to correctly install
    [therubyracer](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer), because of

-   [a longstanding
    bug](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer/issues/284) that causes
    therubyracer to look for a 32-bit version of libv8, which is only a
    problem because

-   Bundler insists on downloading a 64-bit binary version of the libv8
    gem, corresponding to the kernel version, even though the Ruby it’s
    running is a 32-bit binary that can’t load those modules anyway; but
    all this is only a problem because

-   I needed to get Danbooru running on Ruby 2.1.5 and therefore the
    gems in my old 1.9.3 installation had to be rebuilt, because

-   Danbooru development runs at the pace of albert, its owner and
    developer, and he [randomly changed the upstream code to depend on
    Ruby
    2.1.5](https://github.com/r888888888/danbooru/commit/53844af8dc4d1da5d2d027dce43597549b01a5ad)
    in between minor versions, but I wanted to upgrade regardless,
    because

-   there was a fix for a problem where Pixiv uploads to [the imageboard
    I run](https://room208.org/booru/) were breaking, which only
    happened in the first place because

-   Pixiv changed their image page layout.

QED.
