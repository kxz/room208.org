A whole slew of new anime previews just came out:

-   [<cite>Dusk Maiden of
    Amnesia</cite>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh0_IUwRTnA)
    (<cite>Tasogare Otome × Amnesia</cite>) PV 3. A first glimpse at the
    show in motion, so to speak, and it looks all right.

-   [<cite>Kids on the
    Slope</cite>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8owoGJntHJw)
    (<cite>Sakamichi no Apollon</cite>). In case you haven’t heard, YUKI
    is doing the opening theme, her first work for anime since
    <cite>Honey & Clover II</cite>.

-   [<cite>Tsuritama</cite>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZASvjvEVfag).
    Some nice style goin’ on there.

-   There’s no new video for this announcement, but <cite>Medaka
    Box</cite> is reportedly going to run for 45 episodes. Forty-five!

-   And perhaps most unexpectedly,
    [<cite>Robotics;Notes</cite>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkbtc9qbEWQ),
    the last in the Nitroplus/5pb. visual novel trilogy started by
    <cite>Chaos;Head</cite> and <cite>Steins;Gate</cite>, has announced
    an adaptation – and the game won’t even be released until this
    summer! The anime is scheduled to start airing in noitaminA in
    October.

I’m trying really, *really* hard not to set my expectations too high,
but right now I’m failing pretty badly at doing so.
