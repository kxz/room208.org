Dear Tumblr,

This new photo uploader is terrible. The one thing it does right is
adding drag-and-drop; aside from that, there is no excuse for:

-   Blocking the browser trying to generate an “instant preview” data
    URI, especially for large images.

-   Showing no indication that an image is currently uploading, which
    makes it nearly impossible to figure out if a post succeeded.

-   Long waits if you click “Create post” while a photo is still being
    processed, with only a spinner in the bottom-right corner.

-   Absolutely useless error messages, which are admittedly a carryover
    from the previous photo posting page.

At least you fixed Markdown previews.
