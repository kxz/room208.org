answer: <p>Funny story. I got to pick my middle name. As you can imagine, that means
  it wasn&rsquo;t on my birth certificate &ndash; however, some of my other government
  identification does have it, because by the time I was old enough to fill out forms
  I made a habit of putting my full name on everything. So, assuming you define &ldquo;real
  name&rdquo; as my legal name, I don&rsquo;t have one real name. True story.</p>
