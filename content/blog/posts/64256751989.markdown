@[mnxmnkmnd](http://mnxmnkmnd.tumblr.com/) successfully turns one of
\#yackfest’s more… let’s say “unusual” conversations into a course
paper:

> I was chatting in a casual topic-less “room” I frequent when a
> stranger who had been lurking (i.e. present but not speaking) for
> several weeks decided to speak up about something near and dear to
> him: a video game called “Barcode Kanojo”. The object of this game is
> to scan barcodes of consumer products. Each barcode is decoded and
> “transformed” into a fictitious cartoon “girlfriend” (JP: “kanojo”)
> that interacts with the player in a scripted, persistent manner. As
> the unsolicited elaboration continued, I was struck by the
> psychologically fascinating if personally disturbing intersection of
> consumerism, psychosexual activity, and fictional narrative.
