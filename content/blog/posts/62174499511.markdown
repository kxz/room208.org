James Mickens reminisces about when hardware architecture was easy and
fun in *;login:* magazine:

> Anything that you invented would be amazing, and the laws of physics
> were actively trying to help you succeed. Your friend would say, “I
> wish that we could predict branches more accurately,” and you’d think,
> “maybe we can leverage three bits of state per branch to implement a
> simple saturating counter,” and you’d laugh and declare that such a
> stupid scheme would never work, but then you’d test it and it would be
> 94% accurate, and the branches would wake up the next morning and read
> their newspapers and the headlines would say OUR WORLD HAS BEEN SET ON
> FIRE. You’d give your buddy a high-five and go celebrate at the bar,
> and then you’d think, “I wonder if we can make branch predictors even
> more accurate,” and the next day you’d start XOR’ing the branch’s PC
> address with a shift register containing the branch’s recent branching
> history, because in those days, you could XOR anything with anything
> and get something useful, and you test the new branch predictor, and
> now you’re up to 96% accuracy, and the branches call you on the phone
> and say OK, WE GET IT, YOU DO NOT LIKE BRANCHES, but the phone call
> goes to your voicemail because you’re too busy driving the speed boats
> and wearing the monocles that you purchased after your promotion at
> work.
