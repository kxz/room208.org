In theory, yes. Almost everyone I asked about the GRE before I took it
told me it was little more than a slightly more difficult version of the
SAT, and my experience actually taking it largely bore that out. In
practice, most schools only accept GRE scores dating later than five
years prior to application, and very few people come out of high school
thinking “I want to spend the next decade of my life at university!” so
it rarely happens.
