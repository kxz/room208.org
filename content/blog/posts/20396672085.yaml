  <hr><p>Note that once one of the AIs notifies you of the reactor troubles, there
  is no way to switch to the other one.</p>


  <ol><li><p><strong>*Hyun-ae leaves home, in the care of a new friend.</strong> Take
  *Mute&rsquo;s questions to *Hyun-ae. Give them to her in order up to question 8,
  then read the new documents she provides you with. When she asks you for your opinions,
  answer in a supportive manner. Eventually, she&rsquo;ll ask you to decrypt block
  7 and read the documents there.</p>


  <p>Once you&rsquo;ve done so, *Hyun-ae will ping you, and tell you to show her &ldquo;the
  obvious question&rdquo;: *Mute&rsquo;s ninth question. Do that, and read and show
  her the diary entry that she unlocks. Again, tell her that you trust her when she
  asks.</p>


  <p>You&rsquo;ll get dropped back to the home menu. Speak to her one last time. Your
  response to her first question about ridiculousness doesn&rsquo;t matter; answer
  the next two questions by saying that while the two of you don&rsquo;t have a chance
  together, you can take her with you anyway. When prompted to download *Hyun-ae&rsquo;s
  core at the terminal, say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>The former bride falls in love for the first time.</strong> Much
  the same as the previous ending; just tell her in the last conversation that you
  can be together with her. If you made a save at that question, good for you!</p>


  <p>I feel like these first two endings are the easiest to get, and don&rsquo;t need
  to be explained here, but for the sake of completeness&hellip;</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>The investigator leaves alone.</strong> Once you get super-user access,
  run <code>download</code> at any time, without taking an AI personality if offered.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>The security program is relieved of her duties.</strong> Note that
  *Mute has to believe that you&rsquo;re male or lesbian in order to offer to come
  along with you. I believe the latter has to do with your response to the situation
  in block 2, about Oh So-jin&rsquo;s affair.</p>


  <p>When *Mute gives you her questions, don&rsquo;t show them to *Hyun-ae; instead,
  give them to her, until she asks you why you&rsquo;re not doing as you&rsquo;ve
  been told. Say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to her first couple of conjectures, then tell her
  (twice) that you want to hear the story from her. Keep unlocking new documents until
  you get the block 8 logs. Show them to her in order, then speak to her when she
  pings you. Tell her you&rsquo;ve seen everything, then that you&rsquo;ll take her
  with you. Answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the terminal download prompt.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Harem ending.</strong> I thought this was some kind of joke, but
  apparently it&rsquo;s not &ndash; it just requires you to use knowledge you can&rsquo;t
  have in-character. Notice the document ID search above the block index? You can
  use this to manually unlock documents that the AIs haven&rsquo;t given you access
  to, which you can in turn use to mollify *Mute.</p>


  <p>Ignore the questions she gives you for *Hyun-ae &ndash; looking at any one of
  them will trigger the meltdown sequence, which will block off this ending. Instead,
  open the Pale Bride&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill them all!&rdquo; diary entry
  by entering its ID (6-EUY22) into the search box, and show it to *Mute. She&rsquo;ll
  react to it as she does in the other branches. Press on, and show her &ldquo;Forever
  silenced&rdquo; (7-EUX25). Tell her the diary entry is real when she asks, then
  sit back and watch the two AIs make up. You&rsquo;ll get the opportunity to download
  both of them when the time comes, and be treated to an 8-bit version of the credits
  music.</p></li>

  </ol><p>If you want 100% log completion, don&rsquo;t show *Mute&rsquo;s message
  for Smith Kyung-sam in block 6 to *Hyun-ae; she&rsquo;ll say she made a mistake
  and remove your access, leaving you with a one-document hole in your logs.</p>
