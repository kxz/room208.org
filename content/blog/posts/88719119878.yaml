  \ incidentally. Mutsuki (spelled <span lang=\"ja\">\u7766\u6708</span>, as opposed\
  \ to the <em>I/O</em> character&rsquo;s <span lang=\"ja\">\u5922\u6708</span>) is\
  \ the traditional name for the first month of the lunar calendar, and Sakuya (as\
  \ explained in the game) refers to the new moon or the first day of each lunar month\
  \ on which it falls.</p>\n\n<h2>Isaiah Nagy and Izawa Nami (Ereshkigal)</h2>\n\n\
  <p>The pronunciation has been beaten with a stick in Isaiah&rsquo;s case, but it&rsquo;s\
  \ not hard to spot the reference here to Izanagi and Izanami, two of the chief deities\
  \ of Shinto. Nami&rsquo;s name has the added bonus of sounding like the Japanese\
  \ for &ldquo;and now, a wave,&rdquo; which is funny considering all of the flood\
  \ myth stuff that goes on in the middle of the VN. Maybe I&rsquo;m reaching. Then\
  \ again, maybe not.</p>\n\n<h2>Izumo Tsukasa (Enlil)</h2>\n\n<p>Japan&rsquo;s old\
  \ Izumo province was known as &ldquo;the land of the gods,&rdquo; while the name\
  \ Tsukasa refers to one who is in charge of or responsible for something. Fitting,\
  \ given Enlil&rsquo;s imperious nature.</p>\n\n<h2>Igarashi Kousaku (Nergal)</h2>\n\
  \n<p>Written with the more usual characters <span lang=\"ja\">\u5DE5\u4F5C</span>,\
  \ <em>kousaku</em> can mean either &ldquo;workmanship&rdquo; or &ldquo;maneuvering&rdquo;\
  \ (think politics). Nergal does plenty of both throughout. The common surname Igarashi\
  \ is written with the characters for &ldquo;fifty storms,&rdquo; and that man also\
  \ does have a temper&hellip;</p>"
