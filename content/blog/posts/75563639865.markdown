A brief follow-up to [my previous post on customizing Dichotomy’s
fonts](/blog/posts/74988251163.html): Some users (well,
okay, just @[spinor](http://spinor.tumblr.com/)) have reported that
vertical scrollbars appear on `<blockquote>` and `<pre>` elements when
using certain typefaces, including Source Code Pro. This is a
consequence of these fonts’ character boxes being too tall for the line
height (1.2) that Dichotomy uses. You can fix this problem by resetting
the height to the font’s default in your custom CSS:

    body {
        font-family: "MyFont", monospace;
        line-height: normal;
    }
