Most of this talk by Gary Bernhardt centers around how unpredictable
JavaScript’s type coercion is, except presented in a fashion that makes
it funny and not just frustrating. A little humor can take the edge off
of using a language where [even `typeof` can’t get it
straight](http://javascript.crockford.com/survey.html) sometimes.
