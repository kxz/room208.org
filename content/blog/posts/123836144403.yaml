  <p>Kei&rsquo;s family lives in a bungalow in a nondescript residential neighborhood
  not far from Shinagawa Station.  On this particular Friday afternoon, I&rsquo;m
  watching as Kei roots through her closet.  We&rsquo;re the only ones at home for
  the moment.  Kei&rsquo;s father is working his desk job at a textile importer in
  Shinjuku, and the two boys, four and six years younger than Kei, are at school.  Her
  mother, who would ordinarily be with us, is out to buy groceries.</p>


  <p>&ldquo;Aha, found it,&rdquo; Kei says, pulling a handheld electronic device out
  of a worn cardboard box stashed underneath a shelf of old clothes.  The logo on
  the face reads &ldquo;MISE 8400,&rdquo; and it resembles a miniature version of
  a keyboard from the eighties.  A two-line green LCD screen sits above the top row
  of keys.  On the side is a 3.5-inch floppy drive.  Kei randomly presses a few of
  the keys down with her free hand, which bounce back with a series of resounding
  clacks.</p>


  <p>MISE was one of the first manufacturers of these so-called pocket computers,
  a name that stuck even though pockets spacious enough to fit one were rare indeed.  Most
  were capable of running basic programs written in an interpreted language called
  AIM, designed in the 1970s by academics attempting to create a teaching tool for
  new programmers.  The 8400 was released in 1986, at the height of MISE&rsquo;s success.  Over
  two million units were sold.  Unfortunately for the Boston-based company, the rapid
  growth of the modern personal computer market during the 1990s essentially destroyed
  any future for pocket machines, and MISE eventually folded in 1997.  Its remaining
  assets were bought by HP, who put the technology to use in their line of graphing
  calculators.</p>


  <p>Kei flips the 8400&rsquo;s power switch back and forth a few times, to no visible
  effect.  &ldquo;I was kind of expecting this,&rdquo; she says.  &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
  touched this thing in a couple of years, so the batteries have probably gone bad.&rdquo;  She
  beckons me downstairs into the kitchen, where she pulls a pack of trusty AAs from
  a drawer.  After putting in fresh juice, Kei tries to turn the computer on again,
  and sure enough, the front display lights up with a simple prompt: <code>READY</code>
  in blocky, all-capitals English.</p>


  <p>&ldquo;I was only four or five when I first started playing with this, so I didn&rsquo;t
  know any English words at all,&rdquo; Kei tells me.  &ldquo;There was something
  magical about turning this box on and having it talk to me in a new language, like
  a kind of secret code.&rdquo;  She taps out the command <code>SAY INTDIAG()</code>,
  and presses the &ldquo;Run&rdquo; key: immediately, it responds with <code>ROM V2.52
  02/15/91 800 K OK</code>.  &ldquo;Actually, it messed me up when I learned English
  in school later.  I knew all these technical terms like &lsquo;initialize,&rsquo;
  but not more normal words.&rdquo;</p>


  <p>&ldquo;Were you ever teased about that?&rdquo; I ask.</p>


  <p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Kei says.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone else knew
  any better.&rdquo;</p>'
