After [ages of complaining about Tumblr](/blog/tags/tumblr.html), I
finally went and did something about it. This is something I hacked up
in a couple of hours using Tumblr’s JSON export and a static site
generator. Maybe someday I’ll post the source code.

You know where to complain if something’s broken.
