After eight months of sitting dormant in a pre-release branch, here’s a
brand-new major version of Dichotomy – major because it makes a couple
of backwards-incompatible changes to custom settings. Sorry! I’m trying
to keep those to a minimum for future releases.

But enough about that. Let’s talk about the new features instead! They
include support for avatars (finally) and using profile header images as
backgrounds, streamlined desktop layout options, updates to Google
Analytics code, and a few tiny fixes here and there.

Version 4.0 will be available on the Tumblr Theme Garden shortly – at
least I hope so. As usual, if you have any problems, [drop me a message
on Tumblr](http://blog.room208.org/ask) or [report an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/kxz/dichotomy/issues).
