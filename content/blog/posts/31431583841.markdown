Things I was unable to write spacefaring witticisms about:

-   *Hamtaro* (@[queentakesking](http://blog.redono.org/)). I missed
    that whole craze, possibly because I have a mild hamster allergy.
-   *FLAG* (anon, but I can guess).
-   *Carnival Phantasm* (@[sobayoi](http://sobayoi.tumblr.com/)). I have
    a bit of an aversion to everything Nasu has done since the turn of
    the millennium.
-   *Boku no Pico* (anon). Yeah, what?
