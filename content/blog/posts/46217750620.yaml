  <p><em>Psycho-Pass</em> as the anti-<em>Madoka</em>, and why an anticlimactic ending
  isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad one, after the break.</p>


  <!-- more -->


  <hr><p>Gen Urobuchi, lest you forget where he got the nickname &ldquo;Urobutcher,&rdquo;
  established his name as an anime screenwriter by grinding a cast of largely innocent
  teenage girls into despair between the cogs of a cruel, unfeeling magical world.
  Ultimately, <em>Madoka</em>&rsquo;s title character found a way to destroy that
  system once and for all, but the <em>deus ex machina</em> nature of the resolution
  never sat well with me. Madoka&rsquo;s wish may have been born out of the suffering
  that she had watched her friends endure, but it also pointed to a lack of imagination
  on the part of everyone that had contracted before her. The fact that there was
  nothing keeping another prospective magical girl from making the same wish that
  Madoka had essentially cheapened the hardship that the characters underwent throughout
  the series, reducing it to nothing more than emotional window dressing.</p>


  <p>Urobuchi&rsquo;s latest work on <em>Psycho-Pass</em> is by no means flawless,
  but it does at the very least avoid repeating this mistake of <em>Madoka</em>&rsquo;s.
  At first glance, in fact, it seems to commit the opposite error: The Sibyl System
  that runs <em>Psycho-Pass</em>&rsquo; conception of 22nd-century Japan is quite
  literally built on criminal minds, and yet the series ends with its main characters
  trying to keep it from being overthrown. The important difference? The Sibyl System,
  for all its obvious faults, is also more or less the only thing keeping social order,
  whereas <em>Madoka</em>&rsquo;s system of magic had no obvious upsides. This nuance
  gives the internal conflict of <em>Psycho-Pass</em>&rsquo; main character, Akane,
  necessary weight &ndash; she knows on the one hand that Sibyl&rsquo;s micromanagement
  of citizens&rsquo; lives is untenable, but at the same time knows that those selfsame
  lives would likely be forfeit should it be allowed to fall. Instead of <em>Madoka</em>&rsquo;s
  revolutionary ending, then, <em>Psycho-Pass</em> gives us an evolutionary one; as
  Akane puts it, standing in Sibyl&rsquo;s central chamber in the final episode, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
  always aiming for a better society. One day, someone will come to this room to turn
  off the power. We will find a new path. You can count on it,&rdquo; and indeed Akane&rsquo;s
  progression as a character over the course of the series shows that perhaps she&rsquo;s
  ready to do just that. <em>Psycho-Pass</em> recognizes that dystopia cannot simply
  be waved away, and it is for this reason that its conclusion, understated as it
  is, sits better with me than <em>Madoka</em>&rsquo;s finale ever did.</p>'
