Dear Tumblr,

Thank you for adding this new “sticky iframe” that repositions itself
with JavaScript whenever I scroll the page. Until now, I hadn’t grasped
why the blog controls needed to be at the top right of the viewport at
all costs, but now I understand that that space is sacred. It belongs to
you, and you alone!

Just kidding. I [modified two lines of
CSS](https://bitbucket.org/kxz/dichotomy/compare/60b0c60..fe60d85#diff)
in order to restore the original behavior, leaving the JavaScript that
does iframe position checks twice every second functionally inert.

Meanwhile, [theme localization is still fundamentally
broken](/blog/posts/17756259414.html), but who has the time
to think about all that?

Still, you know, these changes would bother me less, even annoying and
unnecessary as they are, were they at least *documented* somewhere.
