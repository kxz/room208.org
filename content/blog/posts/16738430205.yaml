  <hr><p>I&rsquo;ll start with the bad, which in this case was Shizune&rsquo;s route.  I
  will admit that I didn&rsquo;t get the best impression of her character from the
  Act 1 preview, but my problems with her arc have less to do with her personality
  than the overall plotting.  In short, her story suffered from a lack of focus; while
  there were a lot of great ideas sprinkled throughout her path, none of them really
  resolved to my satisfaction.  Take Hisao&rsquo;s learning to sign, for example.  Overcoming
  the barrier of Shizune&rsquo;s deafness could have made for an entire story on its
  own.  Instead, Hisao seems to pick up the ins and outs of an entirely new language
  within months, if not weeks, and the problem gets shoved aside almost as soon as
  it&rsquo;s brought up.  After all, the story needs to move on to Shizune&rsquo;s
  tensions with her family, her history with Lilly, her friendship-that-might-have-been-more
  with Misha, her stress from doing literally half of the work of the Student Council,
  blah blah blah&hellip; you get the idea.  At times, I got the sense that Shizune
  was being pushed out of the spotlight in her own route, especially when it came
  to the ridiculous, and largely pointless, interactions with her family.  (I will
  grudgingly give a tip of my hat, though, to whoever came up with the reference to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kan%C5%8D_Jigor%C5%8D">Kanou Jigorou</a>,
  even if his given name does sound a lot like &ldquo;gigolo.&rdquo;)  Needless to
  say, in the midst of all of this, her relationship with Hisao doesn&rsquo;t get
  much of a chance to develop into something meaningful.  Funnily enough, if there
  was a bright spot in the whole mess, it was the route&rsquo;s heartbreaking bad
  end, which seemed to have more emotional content than the entire rest of the path
  combined.</p>


  <p>The clearest contrast I can draw here is to Emi&rsquo;s storyline.  Now, I&rsquo;ll
  be frank &ndash; her route&rsquo;s not going to win any points for originality,
  but it was simple, to the point, and smoothly executed.  Much like its heroine,
  Emi&rsquo;s arc has a sense of playful self-awareness to it, which shows in the
  dialogue and some of the subversions of expectation throughout her story.  I particularly
  liked how Emi&rsquo;s character turned into something more than the one-dimensional
  exercise-obsessed caricature that Act 1 seems to give off.  While some of the twists
  on her character type, like her age and sexual experience, are again obvious, at
  least in hindsight, they fit smoothly into the rest of her portrayal.  My primary
  quibble with the story lies with Hisao&rsquo;s occasional denseness, especially
  when Emi manages to get away with avoiding the subject of her dad with exactly the
  same words she used earlier to shrug off Hisao&rsquo;s concern about her limp &ndash;
  the one that later turned into an infection and forced her into a wheelchair.  Then
  again, to be fair, it&rsquo;s hardly as egregious as some of Hisao&rsquo;s behavior
  in <cite>Katawa Shoujo</cite>&rsquo;s other arcs, let alone the lead-brick obliviousness
  of certain anime leads.  Oh, and there&rsquo;s also the issue of some of the CGs
  reflecting her <em>*ahem*</em> original character design, but the less said about
  that, the better.</p>


  <p>Lilly&rsquo;s path, too, isn&rsquo;t all that thematically deep.  As I&rsquo;ve
  mentioned in private discussions, though, it seems almost written specifically for
  people who consider her their favorite character, and since I&rsquo;m one of those
  right sentimental fools, her arc is also my favorite out of the five.  It&rsquo;s
  not shy about being a romantic melodrama; this does admittedly work to its detriment
  in the final chapter, which is a bit rushed and predictable, but even then I would
  be lying if I said that the ending didn&rsquo;t run me through the emotional wringer.  Hisao,
  for his part, manages to pull off some amazing maneuvers in courting Lilly, most
  notably with the music box as a going-away gift.  Maybe the setup was a little too
  coincidental, but I&rsquo;ll be damned if that wasn&rsquo;t the smoothest thing
  I&rsquo;ve seen a protagonist do in a romantic visual novel.  The artwork, too,
  is just beautiful, and perhaps the most consistent of any of the routes; the CG
  of Hisao and Lilly in a Hokkaido wheat field, in particular, reminded me strongly
  of <cite>ef</cite> or <cite>5 cm/s</cite>, which is a good thing in my book.</p>


  <p>Now for the two stories I expected to be the heaviest coming in: Rin&rsquo;s
  and Hanako&rsquo;s.  I&rsquo;ll go over the latter first, because it bears a lot
  of similarities to Lilly&rsquo;s route.  In this case, however, that&rsquo;s not
  a good thing, because, well, Lilly&rsquo;s not supposed to be the focus any more
  &ndash; Hanako is.  Yet Acts 2 and 3 of her story felt like a recapitulation of
  many of the events of Lilly&rsquo;s arc, alongside the painfully slow development
  of Hanako&rsquo;s character and relationship with Hisao.  Things don&rsquo;t really
  kick off until just before Act 4 begins, and by then it&rsquo;s too late to give
  the theme that eventually does emerge &ndash; Hanako&rsquo;s wanting to be seen
  as a capable person in her own right, not just something to be protected &ndash;
  suitable consideration.  I kind of wish that Hanako&rsquo;s bad-end outburst were
  a part of the main story, not just something triggered by a rather incredible regression
  in protagonist sensitivity, as it really lays the essential conflict bare.  That
  and a few other scenes, like her revealing the full extent of her scarring to Hisao,
  did stand out in my mind.  They&rsquo;re worth the price of admission if you&rsquo;ve
  already played through Lilly&rsquo;s route (plus you get a glimpse of <a href="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyxvisYyda1qhcb4p.jpg">Hanako&rsquo;s
  adorable pouting face</a>), but not enough by themselves to make up for the route&rsquo;s
  flaws.</p>


  <p>Rin&rsquo;s path does a better job of showing the obstacles that the main couple
  has to overcome to really make their relationship work.  Unfortunately, one of those
  obstacles is Hisao&rsquo;s own personality at the beginning of the arc, where his
  insistence that Rin go forward with her debut exhibition comes off as insensitive
  and irrationally exuberant.  I do have to cut the writer some slack, since Hisao
  is rather star-struck at this point, but it&rsquo;s frustrating to see him do it
  all the same, and it&rsquo;s hard not to feel that Hisao and Rin are just talking
  past each other in an endless circle because of it.  The route does manage to break
  through and end on a high note, though, and in a natural fashion that avoids turning
  Rin&rsquo;s personality upside-down while still clearly showing that she does trust
  Hisao.  I feel compelled here to drop in a mention of Rin&rsquo;s &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;
  end, which brings up an interesting dilemma.  Would she be better off seizing a
  rare, promising chance at developing her talent as an artist, or staying at Yamaku
  and learning to open up to Hisao and her other classmates?  Ultimately, I&rsquo;m
  not sure there&rsquo;s a good answer.</p>


  <p>On the overall, <cite>Katawa Shoujo</cite> met my expectations, and in fact simply
  blew them away at the best of times.  I was especially impressed with how polished
  the presentation was; the music was a real highlight, so much so that I&rsquo;d
  occasionally just leave the game open while I did other things just so I could leave
  the soundtrack on in the background.  Fortunately, it&rsquo;s available for <a href="http://katawashoujo.blogspot.com/2012/01/katawa-shoujo-soundtrack-up-for.html">free
  download</a> now, so I don&rsquo;t have to do that any more.  The artwork was spottier,
  particularly with some of the CGs, and there were a few noticeable instances of
  suboptimal editing in the scripts, but I didn&rsquo;t find these issues too distracting.  If
  you can get past the unfortunate two-word description of <cite>Katawa Shoujo</cite>
  as &ldquo;cripple porn,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll find a visual novel with sensitivity
  and a good bit of heart to it, and for that I am grateful to the developers who
  spent so much time putting it together.</p>


  <p>Oh, one last thing.  Iwanako doesn&rsquo;t play all that much of a role in the
  plot, aside from the prologue and her letter in each of the arcs.  I can&rsquo;t
  say that she should have been more prominent &ndash; in the story, she&rsquo;s mostly
  a symbol of how Hisao overcomes his past burdens, and I&rsquo;m fine with that.  I
  can&rsquo;t be the only one curious, though, as to how a story like this would play
  out from her perspective.</p>'

    \ that later turned into an infection and forced her into a wheelchair.  Then\
    \ again, to be fair, it\u2019s hardly as egregious as some of Hisao\u2019s behavior\
    \ in Katawa Shoujo\u2019s other arcs, let alone the lead-brick obliviousness of\
    \ certain anime leads.  Oh, and there\u2019s also the issue of some of the CGs\
    \ reflecting her <em>*ahem*</em> original character design, but the less said\
    \ about that, the better.</p>\n\n<p>Lilly\u2019s path, too, isn\u2019t all that\
    \ thematically deep.  As I\u2019ve mentioned in private discussions, though, it\
    \ seems almost written specifically for people who consider her their favorite\
    \ character, and since I\u2019m one of those right sentimental fools, her arc\
    \ is also my favorite out of the five.  It\u2019s not shy about being a romantic\
    \ melodrama; this does admittedly work to its detriment in the final chapter,\
    \ which is a bit rushed and predictable, but even then I would be lying if I said\
    \ that the ending didn\u2019t run me through the emotional wringer.  Hisao, for\
    \ his part, manages to pull off some amazing maneuvers in courting Lilly, most\
    \ notably with the music box as a going-away gift.  Maybe the setup was a little\
    \ too coincidental, but I\u2019ll be damned if that wasn\u2019t the smoothest\
    \ thing I\u2019ve seen a protagonist do in a romantic visual novel.  The artwork,\
    \ too, is just beautiful, and perhaps the most consistent of any of the routes;\
    \ the CG of Hisao and Lilly in a Hokkaido wheat field, in particular, reminded\
    \ me strongly of ef or 5 cm/s, which is a good thing in my book.</p>\n\n<p>Now\
    \ for the two stories I expected to be the heaviest coming in: Rin\u2019s and\
    \ Hanako\u2019s.  I\u2019ll go over the latter first, because it bears a lot of\
    \ similarities to Lilly\u2019s route.  In this case, however, that\u2019s not\
    \ a good thing, because, well, Lilly\u2019s not supposed to be the focus any more\
    \ \u2013 Hanako is.  Yet Acts 2 and 3 of her story felt like a recapitulation\
    \ of many of the events of Lilly\u2019s arc, alongside the painfully slow development\
    \ of Hanako\u2019s character and relationship with Hisao.  Things don\u2019t really\
    \ kick off until just before Act 4 begins, and by then it\u2019s too late to give\
    \ the theme that eventually does emerge \u2013 Hanako\u2019s wanting to be seen\
    \ as a capable person in her own right, not just something to be protected \u2013\
    \ suitable consideration.  I kind of wish that Hanako\u2019s bad-end outburst\
    \ were a part of the main story, not just something triggered by a rather incredible\
    \ regression in protagonist sensitivity, as it really lays the essential conflict\
    \ bare.  That and a few other scenes, like her revealing the full extent of her\
    \ scarring to Hisao, did stand out in my mind.  They\u2019re worth the price of\
    \ admission if you\u2019ve already played through Lilly\u2019s route (plus you\
    \ get a glimpse of <a href=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyxvisYyda1qhcb4p.jpg\"\
    >Hanako\u2019s adorable pouting face</a>), but not enough by themselves to make\
    \ up for the route\u2019s flaws.</p>\n\n<p>Rin\u2019s path does a better job of\
    \ showing the obstacles that the main couple has to overcome to really make their\
    \ relationship work.  Unfortunately, one of those obstacles is Hisao\u2019s own\
    \ personality at the beginning of the arc, where his insistence that Rin go forward\
    \ with her debut exhibition comes off as insensitive and irrationally exuberant.\
    \  I do have to cut the writer some slack, since Hisao is rather star-struck at\
    \ this point, but it\u2019s frustrating to see him do it all the same, and it\u2019\
    s hard not to feel that Hisao and Rin are just talking past each other in an endless\
    \ circle because of it.  The route does manage to break through and end on a high\
    \ note, though, and in a natural fashion that avoids turning Rin\u2019s personality\
    \ upside-down while still clearly showing that she does trust Hisao.  I feel compelled\
    \ here to drop in a mention of Rin\u2019s \u201Cneutral\u201D end, which brings\
    \ up an interesting dilemma.  Would she be better off seizing a rare, promising\
    \ chance at developing her talent as an artist, or staying at Yamaku and learning\
    \ to open up to Hisao and her other classmates?  Ultimately, I\u2019m not sure\
    \ there\u2019s a good answer.</p>\n\n<p>On the overall, Katawa Shoujo met my expectations,\
    \ and in fact simply blew them away at the best of times.  I was especially impressed\
    \ with how polished the presentation was; the music was a real highlight, so much\
    \ so that I\u2019d occasionally just leave the game open while I did other things\
    \ just so I could leave the soundtrack on in the background.  Fortunately, it\u2019\
    s available for <a href=\"http://katawashoujo.blogspot.com/2012/01/katawa-shoujo-soundtrack-up-for.html\"\
    >free download</a> now, so I don\u2019t have to do that any more.  The artwork\
    \ was spottier, particularly with some of the CGs, and there were a few noticeable\
    \ instances of suboptimal editing in the scripts, but I didn\u2019t find these\
    \ issues too distracting.  If you can get past the unfortunate two-word description\
    \ of Katawa Shoujo as \u201Ccripple porn,\u201D you\u2019ll find a visual novel\
    \ with sensitivity and a good bit of heart to it, and for that I am grateful to\
    \ the developers who spent so much time putting it together.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, one\
    \ last thing.  Iwanako doesn\u2019t play all that much of a role in the plot,\
    \ aside from the prologue and her letter in each of the arcs.  I can\u2019t say\
    \ that she should have been more prominent \u2013 in the story, she\u2019s mostly\
    \ a symbol of how Hisao overcomes his past burdens, and I\u2019m fine with that.\
    \  I can\u2019t be the only one curious, though, as to how a story like this would\
    \ play out from her perspective.</p>"

    \ the number of places where the entire project could have fallen apart.  That\

    \ than just persistence.</p>\n\n<p>A rough, spoilertastic rundown of my thoughts\
    \ after the break.</p>\n\n[[MORE]]\n\n<hr><p>I\u2019ll start with the bad, which\
    \ in this case was Shizune\u2019s route.  I will admit that I didn\u2019t get\
    \ the best impression of her character from the Act 1 preview, but my problems\
    \ with her arc have less to do with her personality than the overall plotting.\
    \  In short, her story suffered from a lack of focus; while there were a lot of\
    \ great ideas sprinkled throughout her path, none of them really resolved to my\
    \ satisfaction.  Take Hisao\u2019s learning to sign, for example.  Overcoming\
    \ the barrier of Shizune\u2019s deafness could have made for an entire story on\
    \ its own.  Instead, Hisao seems to pick up the ins and outs of an entirely new\
    \ language within months, if not weeks, and the problem gets shoved aside almost\
    \ as soon as it\u2019s brought up.  After all, the story needs to move on to Shizune\u2019\
    s tensions with her family, her history with Lilly, her friendship-that-might-have-been-more\
    \ with Misha, her stress from doing literally half of the work of the Student\
    \ Council, blah blah blah\u2026 you get the idea.  At times, I got the sense that\
    \ Shizune was being pushed out of the spotlight in her own route, especially when\
    \ it came to the ridiculous, and largely pointless, interactions with her family.\
    \  (I will grudgingly give a tip of my hat, though, to whoever came up with the\
    \ reference to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kan%C5%8D_Jigor%C5%8D\"\
    >Kanou Jigorou</a>, even if his given name does sound a lot like \u201Cgigolo.\u201D\
    )  Needless to say, in the midst of all of this, her relationship with Hisao doesn\u2019\
    t get much of a chance to develop into something meaningful.  Funnily enough,\
    \ if there was a bright spot in the whole mess, it was the route\u2019s heartbreaking\
    \ bad end, which seemed to have more emotional content than the entire rest of\
    \ the path combined.</p>\n\n<p>The clearest contrast I can draw here is to Emi\u2019\
    s storyline.  Now, I\u2019ll be frank \u2013 her route\u2019s not going to win\
    \ any points for originality, but it was simple, to the point, and smoothly executed.\
    \  Much like its heroine, Emi\u2019s arc has a sense of playful self-awareness\
    \ to it, which shows in the dialogue and some of the subversions of expectation\
    \ throughout her story.  I particularly liked how Emi\u2019s character turned\
    \ into something more than the one-dimensional exercise-obsessed caricature that\
    \ Act 1 seems to give off.  While some of the twists on her character type, like\
    \ her age and sexual experience, are again obvious, at least in hindsight, they\
    \ fit smoothly into the rest of her portrayal.  My primary quibble with the story\
    \ lies with Hisao\u2019s occasional denseness, especially when Emi manages to\
    \ get away with avoiding the subject of her dad with exactly the same words she\
    \ used earlier to shrug off Hisao\u2019s concern about her limp \u2013 the one\
    \ that later turned into an infection and forced her into a wheelchair.  Then\
    \ again, to be fair, it\u2019s hardly as egregious as some of Hisao\u2019s behavior\
