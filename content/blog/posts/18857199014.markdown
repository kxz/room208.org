@[spinor](http://spinor.tumblr.com/), [on type behavior in
JavaScript](http://spinor.tumblr.com/post/18839193970/the-surprisingly-elegant-javascript-type-model):

Type coercion is okay in some limited cases. Being able to write
`"You have " + n + " cows"` for an integer `n` without having to
explicitly convert it to a string first saves on obvious boilerplate. My
primary issue with JavaScript’s coercion behavior is that it violates
the principle of least surprise from here to next Sunday. (See [my
earlier post on “Wat”](/blog/posts/16324633518.html).)
