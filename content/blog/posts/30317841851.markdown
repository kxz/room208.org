Observations from episode 9 of *Humanity Has Declined*:

1.  This was, hands down, the single best episode of anything so far
    this season, an exponent of what makes this show so great: the
    fairies’ absurd mix of cheer and darkness, our protagonist’s deadpan
    responses, and on-point satirical hits that just kept on coming.
    It’s a shame this appears to be a self-contained episode, because I
    could have easily seen it extending into a second. Come on, girl –
    you could have at least declared war on a neighboring island or
    something!

2.  The fairies are leaders after my own image:

    > **Protagonist:** If you had your own nation, what would you do?
    >
    > **Fairy A:** Taxation.
    >
    > **Fairy B:** Oppression.
    >
    > **Fairy C:** Suppression.
    >
    > **Fairy D:** Persecution!
