So [Hemingway](http://hemingwayapp.com/)’s the latest of these web-based
language analyzers to come on the scene, claiming to provide easy
identification of stylistic weaknesses in prose. Here are a few hints:
If it marks down entire parts of speech, like Hemingway does adverbs,
it’s probably useless. If on top of that it misidentifies words like
*frilly*, *lively*, and *lovely* as adverbs based on their suffixes,
it’s definitely useless. If [it thinks *teh* (sic) repeated 31 times is
good prose](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=10416)… well, you
can figure that one out for yourself.

I suppose I shouldn’t expect much from a webapp that frequently advises
you to use “0 or fewer” adverbs, though.
