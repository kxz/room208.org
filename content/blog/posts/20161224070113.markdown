Video games have more than their share of, let’s say, unrealistically
well-endowed female characters. The common refrain invoked in defense of
these character designs is that the depictions of men as tall, trim, and
muscled are no closer to the truth. Usually, the counterargument then
proceeds to how the physical traits given to male characters are
reasonable in most settings, while those given to females are have no
such justification and can only be explained by sexual objectification,
and so on.

I’d like to present *Keijo!!!!!!!!* as a different sort of rebuttal. It
takes the “T&A is just the feminine version of buff” line of thought to
its logical conclusion, by putting on shounen calling-your-attacks
fights that exclusively use those breasts and buttocks. In this world, a
woman can launch an opponent dozens of meters in the air with just her
butt and the right training. This is, however, clearly not the case in
reality. It follows that the aforementioned depictions of men and women
are not unrealistic in the same way, at least not in the world we as the
viewers live in.

So, yeah, QED or whatever.
