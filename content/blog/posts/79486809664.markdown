The “traditional” analysis (see, e.g., T.J. Vance, *An Introduction to
Japanese Phonology*, 1987), is that high vowels are devoiced or elided
entirely between two voiceless consonants (/p/ /t(s)/ /ch/ /s(h)/ /k/
/h/), or word-finally after affricates and fricatives (/s/ /sh/ /ch/).
The apparent motivation for this would be assimilation to the vowel’s
surrounding environment – it’s “easier” in some sense to pronounce three
voiceless segments in a row than a “voiceless, voiced, voiceless”
sequence. There are some differences on the particular phonological
feature involved ([maybe it’s \[spread glottis\]
instead?](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1011221225072)),
and [at least one
study](http://hum2.leidenuniv.nl/ulcl/faculty/vdweijer/jvoice/maekawa.pdf)
argues that this is a probabilistic occurrence rather than a
hard-and-fast rule, affected by external circumstances – but that
information is likely only of interest if you’re a phonologist.
