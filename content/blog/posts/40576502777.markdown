Dear Tumblr,

1.  Please stop calling `window.focus()` in your login page JavaScript.
    Amazingly enough, when I switch to another tab after clicking on my
    Tumblr bookmark, I generally expect that Iâ€™ll be interacting with
    *that* tab. Not yours. Yours can wait.

2.  Is there any reason Markdown preview has been completely, utterly
    broken for the past several days? I kind of use it. A lot.
