Have you ever had strychnine poisoning? Let me tell you, that’s the last
time I wander into some farmer’s fields and treat them like an
all-you-can-eat buffet. Fresh vegetables are *not* worth having those
kinds of convulsions. I thought I was going to die, then I’d wake up
after I’d thought that I was going to die, and think that I was going to
die while I was dead. Even worse, I was fully conscious the whole time.
It’s like hell on earth.

I’ve *been* there.
