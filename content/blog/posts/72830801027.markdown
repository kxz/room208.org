Dear Tumblr,

Yes, yes, we all know you were acquired by Yahoo not too long ago. You
don’t have to shove it in our faces by adding a “search the web” option
to the dashboard. I thought that died in the nineties.

Come to think of it, Yahoo should be doing its best to avoid reminding
us of things we thought died in the nineties.
