> What was SHAFT when Lain came out?

I realize this is in all likelihood a joke, but I’ll give it a serious
answer anyway: [SHAFT’s website proclaims that they’ve been around since
1975](http://www.shaft-web.co.jp/company.html), but [they were largely a
subcontractor for other animation studios until the turn of the
century](http://www.shaft-web.co.jp/works.html), after a few co-outings
with Gainax. Fun fact: SHAFT is credited for “Work Assistance” on the
adaptation of *NieA\_7*, which came in 2000 – two years after *Lain*,
and towards the end of SHAFT’s second-string period.

Akiyuki Shinbou, the studio’s most well-known personality, [started
directing in
1990](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=creator&creatorid=59),
although he didn’t become associated with SHAFT until *Moon Phase* in
2004. He was apparently directing some [very ’90s
anime](http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=814) during
*Lain*’s TV run.
