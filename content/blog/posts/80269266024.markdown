noitaminA announced their upcoming lineup just a few hours ago, and boy,
am I excited. This spring’s shows
[*Ping-Pong*](http://www.pingpong-anime.tv/) (directed by Masaaki Yuasa
of *Tatami Galaxy* renown) and [*Ryuugajou Nanana no
Maizoukin*](http://www.nanana.tv/) were already announced some months
ago; joining them in the summer will be [*Zankyou no
Terror*](http://terror-in-tokyo.com/), a show about a terrorist attack
in Tokyo. Direction will be by Shinichirou Watanabe, with music by Yoko
Kanno, pairing up again after *Kids on the Slope*. The fall will see the
long-awaited sequel to [*Psycho-Pass*](http://psycho-pass.com/), leading
into a feature film in the winter, as well as an adaptation of
[*Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso*](http://kimiuso.jp/), which received Best
Shounen at the Kodansha Manga Awards last year. 2015 will open with an
anime version of the [*Saenai Heroine no
Sodatekata*](http://www.saenai.tv/) light novel series, along with
adaptations of [Project Itoh](http://project-itoh.com)’s
multi-award-winning science fiction novels *Genocidal Organ* and
*Harmony*.

There’s a lot to look forward to here. And they say noitaminA is dead.
