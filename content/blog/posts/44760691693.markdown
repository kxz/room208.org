I don’t know how I forgot to mention this in [my litany of complaints
about the new photo uploader](/blog/posts/44466178540.html),
but here’s another glaring flaw: Clicking “Preview this post” will
sometimes disable all of the save buttons, meaning that you’ll have to
either start a new post or hack away at the form in a DOM inspector to
actually publish what you were previewing.

Oh, who am I kidding? Nobody actually bothers looking at their posts
before they publish them anyway. \*cough\*
