I haven’t posted in a while, but I’m also too tired to write anything
useful, so here’s a link to an autobiographical Japanese webcomic about
parenting in French Canada where the family’s only common language is
English. I [saw it the other day on
/r/japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/2otgze/my_wife_is_drawing_a_comic_about_raising_our/)
and… well, okay, yes, I’m blatantly reposting it, why do you ask?
