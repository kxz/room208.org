  href="http://blog.room208.org/post/70728179447">Last time</a>, I remarked that nobody
  reads long posts. I&rsquo;m getting around that this go-round by splitting this
  one up into two parts. Ha-<em>ha!</em></p>


  <h2><em>Golden Time</em></h2>


  <p><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/7616fdb59ba2bd07172a9a89154f45e8/tumblr_inline_nhw07avNkD1qhcb4p.jpg"
  alt=""/></p>


  <p>I won&rsquo;t deny that <em>Golden Time</em> doesn&rsquo;t make that great of
  a first impression. The premise of the romance drama reads like a gimmick, what
  with the main character having amnesia, and the first few episodes stick more or
  less to the fish-out-of-water formula. If I&rsquo;d seen <em>Toradora!</em> earlier,
  too, hearing that both series shared an original author, Yuyuko Takemiya, would
  have set off more alarm bells in my head. It&rsquo;s a good thing that didn&rsquo;t
  happen, though, because <em>Golden Time</em> is one of the better entries in the
  genre to come around in a while, taking full advantage of its emotionally fraught
  setting to draw out memorable performances from Yui Horie and Ai Kayano. And hey,
  it&rsquo;s good to have a show in this genre where the cast are all more or less
  adults for a change. Well, college students. Close enough.</p>


  <h2><em>Madoka: Rebellion</em></h2>


  <p><img src="http://33.media.tumblr.com/c2c9b5db1659e98eaf4f043b7b7cfd64/tumblr_inline_nhvz8pU6sA1qhcb4p.jpg"
  alt=""/></p>


  <p>I already wrote quite a bit about the theatrical sequel to the original <em>Madoka</em>
  TV series in <a href="http://blog.room208.org/post/84717187433">a spoiler-filled
  review</a> back in May. For those of you who don&rsquo;t want to have the movie
  ruined, though, or just don&rsquo;t like reading too much, here&rsquo;s a summary:
  stunning animation, a spellbinding score by Yuki Kajiura, and tremendous writing
  out of Gen Urobuchi &ndash; the last of which is all the more impressive given that
  the ending of the original series didn&rsquo;t leave much apparent room for a sequel.
  (If only <a href="http://blog.room208.org/post/105557009418"><em>Psycho-Pass 2</em></a>
  had been in similarly good hands.)</p>


  <h2>Yasuhiro Yoshiura&rsquo;s new films</h2>


  <p><img src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/cef8c6c5cc5f56b82db00a6956a7f513/tumblr_inline_nhw1uugqhR1qhcb4p.jpg"
  alt=""/></p>


  <p>The inimitable filmmaker behind <em>Time of Eve</em> struck again twice last
  year, and lo, it was good. <em>Patema Inverted</em> was easily the bigger of the
  two efforts, and it shows in the scale of the world that Yoshiura builds in the
  film, a (kinda) half-underground half-dystopia that is wholly impressive. The extroverted
  nature of action adventure isn&rsquo;t quite to the usually more introspective Yoshiura&rsquo;s
  talents &ndash; the lead antagonist is nothing if not cartoonish in his villainy
  &ndash; but what separates <em>Patema</em> from, say, Makoto Shinkai&rsquo;s venture
  into similar territory with his <em>Children Who Chase Lost Voices from Deep Below</em>
  is that <em>Patema</em> holds on to a genuine sense of awe and wonder. It&rsquo;s
  a great all-ages film, on top of all that.</p>


  <p>Flying further under the radar was <em>Harmonie</em>, a thirty-minute short produced
  for 2014&rsquo;s Anime Mirai. A concise love story, <em>Harmonie</em> plays more
  to Yoshiura&rsquo;s traditional strengths while displaying an atypical, but well-executed,
  sentimentality. If nothing else, it has one of the more ingenious twists I&rsquo;ve
  seen on the old trope of fated encounters.</p>


  <p>Stay tuned for part two. Or don&rsquo;t. Your loss.</p>'
