I put my first package on PyPI. Then I found a bug, so I made a point
release to fix it! There are probably more of those lurking, which you
can report [over on GitHub](https://github.com/kxz/waapuro/issues).

Just like so many others before me, I wrote this library to scratch an
itch, namely [providing romanized pronunciations for Omnipresence’s
WWWJDIC
plugin](https://github.com/kxz/omnipresence/commit/2bed7169f1fc4c2cc9273721d2efe2d9b8463484).
(Speaking of which, if I ever get that bot’s code into a less shameful
state, I should put it on PyPI too…)
