  \ (&ldquo;February 17, 2012&rdquo;), while in German the commonly accepted order\
  \ is DMY (&ldquo;17. Februar 2012&rdquo;). A Tumblr theme can&rsquo;t support both\

  \ strings are supposed to eliminate in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Japanese date\
  \ support is especially bad, for two reasons. First, the order is invariably year-month-day,\
  \ which Tumblr doesn&rsquo;t even provide an option for. Second, Japanese and Chinese\
  \ require the use of date component suffixes when writing out full dates: \u5E74\
  \ for the year, \u6708 for the month, and \u65E5 for the day of the month. (Korean\
  \ does this as well, except with hangul spellings for the Chinese characters.) A\
  \ properly-formatted date looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2012\u5E742\u670817\u65E5\
  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead, at best, what Tumblr gives you is something like\
  \ this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>17 2\u6708 2012\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The incorrect order\
  \ is obvious; the month is the only element that retains its suffix because it&rsquo;s\
  \ allowed to be an arbitrary string of characters, while the other components are\
  \ required to be numeric.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to rag specifically on Tumblr\
  \ for this; it&rsquo;s a problem I&rsquo;ve encountered in numerous places, but\

  \ have options for &ldquo;short&rdquo; (&ldquo;2/17/2012&rdquo;), &ldquo;medium&rdquo;\
  \ (&ldquo;February 17, 2012&rdquo;), and &ldquo;full&rdquo; (&ldquo;Friday, February\
