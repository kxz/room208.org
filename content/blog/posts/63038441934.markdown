I watched the first episode of *Beyond the Boundary* (*Kyoukai no
Kanata*) today, and I liked what I saw. It’s entirely too early for me
to draw general judgments, of course, but so far director Taichi
Ishidate has acquitted himself well in building a subdued, slightly
off-kilter supernatural mood that draws the viewer in. But that’s not
what I really wanted to talk about – I really want to highlight Risa
Taneda, who here lends her voice to Mirai. Most will know Taneda for
playing *From the New World*’s main protagonist Saki, where at points
her vocal performance singlehandedly carried the show; she’s also
starred in a handful of comedy anime this year, *Yuyushiki* and *Kiniro
Mosaic* among them. It’s no mean feat that she sounds right at home no
matter where she is, especially given that her characters seem to have
very little in common with each other. The material she’s been given in
*Beyond the Boundary*’s first episode isn’t particularly strong, but it
does serve as further evidence of how she can adapt to seemingly any
role. I look forward to seeing what lies in store over the next few
weeks, because it’s looking good.
