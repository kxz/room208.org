1.  You might remember that the second season of the *Psycho-Pass* TV
    series was [basically narratively
    inconsequential](http://blog.room208.org/post/105557009418). Since
    its release schedule suggests that it was being worked on in
    parallel with this movie, I’ve long suspected that this was a
    deliberate decision by the writers to keep plot contradictions from
    popping up. The film does nothing to disabuse me of this notion,
    since it seems content to proceed as if virtually all of *PP2* never
    happened. Which is perfectly fine by me, since the behavior of the
    Sibyl System is core to the movie’s plot, and *PP2* made it too
    subject to the whims of individuals to be truly menacing.

2.  Speaking of which, fansubbers, it’s spelled S-i-b-y-l. As in, you
    know, the [Sibyls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibyl) of Greek
    myth. Not S-y-b-i-l. The correct spelling is onscreen more than
    once, for crying out loud.

3.  There is a lot of badly-pronounced English in the movie, which isn’t
    really necessary. I suppose it’s a reasonable choice of language for
    a multinational union of Southeast Asian countries, but it’s still a
    little hard to sit through the Japanese voice actors’ middling
    inflections. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for an official version
    that splices together the Japanese and English dubs, though even
    then they’ll all sound like Americans and not real Cambodians or
    Thais or Malaysians or what have you. Oh, well.

4.  EGOIST’s “Nameless Beasts” really is a great song.

5.  Mika, Akane’s junior colleague as Inspector, still has her air of
    superiority about her, but given that she only has a handful of
    lines in the movie, I’m willing to forgive the lack of development.
    If it hadn’t been for the awful way she was handled in *PP2*, I
    doubt many people would give her behavior here a second thought. The
    rest of the characters introduced by the previous season basically
    only exist as extras, which isn’t much of a change from before, come
    to think of it. Maybe a third TV series would do them some good.

6.  There’s a lot packed into the film’s 114-minute runtime, and as a
    result some major plot threads are resolved only hurriedly in the
    end, perhaps a consequence of the definite tilt towards explosive
    action sequences and visceral hand-to-hand fights. This is nowhere
    near the triumph that Gen Urobuchi’s earlier work on [*Madoka:
    Rebellion*](http://blog.room208.org/post/84717187433) was. Still,
    though, the movie manages to do what *PP2* couldn’t and extend the
    world to a new setting, new characters, and new conflict. We learn
    much more about what the Sibyl System was designed to protect its
    citizens against. We realize that systems, like humans, seek their
    own survival. And we feel that slight allegorical twinge, as if the
    contradiction of violence for peace were an important question on
    the minds of Japanese viewers right this very moment.

7.  Seven is a great number to end on, don’t you think?
