Funny story. I got to pick my middle name. As you can imagine, that
means it wasn’t on my birth certificate – however, some of my other
government identification does have it, because by the time I was old
enough to fill out forms I made a habit of putting my full name on
everything. So, assuming you define “real name” as my legal name, I
don’t have one real name. True story.
