Dear Tumblr,

Have you considered allowing more than one file in a theme? Because as
it stands now, you’re basically forcing theme developers to inline
several kilobytes of CSS and JavaScript for every page request. That’s a
pretty jaw-droppingly stupid waste of bandwidth.

I mean, sure, it’s *your* bandwidth. You can do what you want with it.

I’m just saying, it’s pretty stupid.
