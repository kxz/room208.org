I have to say that this anime season has had a disappointing trend of
otherwise stellar shows with less-than-stellar endings. First came
*Chuu2koi*, whose conclusion wasn’t terrible, but went overboard in
trying to re-establish the lighthearted tone of its first several
episodes. Now we have *My Little Monster*, which was actually already
struggling by about two-thirds of the way through the season – as the
later episodes wore on, the key relationship between Haru and Shizuku
just about stagnated, and the main cast’s antics lost their freshness as
a result. I know there’s a possibility that the show’s producers are
leaving open a hook for a second season, but the fact that they ran out
of momentum partway through the first doesn’t speak well to a potential
sequel’s prospects. With that in mind, I can only recommend watching *My
Little Monster* if you stop about halfway through the series, while it’s
still hilarious and quite perceptive.

That being said, it’s better than what I’m expecting from the three
episodes of *Say “I love you.”* that I haven’t yet gotten around to.
