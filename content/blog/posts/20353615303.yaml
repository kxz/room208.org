  <ul><li><p><cite>Thermae Romae</cite> didn&rsquo;t get the treatment it deserved,
  especially given the other offerings in noitaminA this season, but it still manages
  to charm even with just three episodes. Just try to ignore the low-budget animation.
  <strong>7</strong></p></li>

  <li><p><cite>Nisemonogatari</cite> doesn&rsquo;t quite live up to the standard set
  by its predecessor; the series spends a little too much time on quirks that were
  already established in <cite>Bakemonogatari</cite>, and leaves the main story a
  little compressed. Still, given such a high bar, that hardly condemns it to failure,
  and the show is still outrageous fun nonetheless. The new characters are solid and
  the dialogue retains that trademark Nisio Isin wit. It&rsquo;s plenty to whet the
  appetite before <cite>Kizumonogatari</cite> lands later this year. <strong>8</strong></p></li>

  <li><p><cite>Black Rock Shooter</cite>&rsquo;s characters seem to have the psychological
  resilience of a house of cards, and I don&rsquo;t even know how to react to the
  story and pacing, which are some of the messiest I&rsquo;ve ever seen in anime.
  The creators may have had only eight episodes to work with, but from the evidence
  I don&rsquo;t think giving them another four or five would have helped at all. Maybe
  they should have let <cite>Thermae Romae</cite> have them instead. <strong>3</strong></p></li>

  <li><p><cite>Guilty Crown</cite> hasn&rsquo;t gotten any better since I wrote <a
  href="http://blog.room208.org/post/19924428985">my last review</a>. In fairness,
  though, I&rsquo;ll mention that Hiroyuki Sawano&rsquo;s soundtrack is pretty good
  as long as you pretend that the non-Japanese lyrics really are just gibberish. <strong>4</strong></p></li>

  <li><p><cite>Amagami SS+</cite> is just as hopelessly awkward as the first season,
  and even fluffier because it doesn&rsquo;t have to really bother with that whole
  &ldquo;plot&rdquo; thing, but I can live with that. <strong>6</strong></p></li>

  <li><p><cite>Chihayafuru</cite>&hellip; wow. Simply amazing from top to bottom.
