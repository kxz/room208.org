<p>Video games have more than their share of, let’s say, unrealistically
well-endowed female characters.  The common refrain invoked in defense
of these character designs is that the depictions of men as tall, trim,
and muscled are no closer to the truth.  Usually, the counterargument
then proceeds to how the physical traits given to male characters are
reasonable in most settings, while those given to females are have no
such justification and can only be explained by sexual objectification,
and so on.</p>

<p>I’d like to present <em>Keijo!!!!!!!!</em> as a different sort of
rebuttal.  It takes the “T&amp;A is just the feminine version of buff”
line of thought to its logical conclusion, by putting on shounen
calling-your-attacks fights that exclusively use those breasts and
buttocks.  In this world, a woman can launch an opponent dozens of
meters in the air with just her butt and the right training.  This is,
however, clearly not the case in reality.  It follows that the
aforementioned depictions of men and women are not unrealistic in the
same way, at least not in the world we as the viewers live in.</p>

<p>So, yeah, QED or whatever.</p>
