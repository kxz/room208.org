Observations from episode 4 of <cite>Nisemonogatari</cite>:

1.  I didn’t quite know how Maaya Sakamoto was going to work her new
    role, but she absolutely nailed it: mischievous, devilish, exactly
    the kind of disturbingly seductive you’d expect from someone with
    the appearance Shinobu had before she was stripped of her power. I
    can’t wait what to hear what she’ll sound like in
    <cite>Kizumonogatari</cite>.

2.  Araragi has the biggest bathroom in the history of anime (above).
