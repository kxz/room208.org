Positive things I have to say about the first episode of the new
<cite>Black Rock Shooter</cite> TV series:

1.  The 3D animation during the otherworld scenes is some of the
    best-looking I’ve ever seen in anime. If I hadn’t read previously
    that the visuals weren’t hand-drawn, I would never have guessed.

2.  … um, hold on, I’m sure something else will come to me.
