answer: '<p>The thing about the TLR series is that it just hasn&rsquo;t kept up with
  recent advancements in the field. I used to recommend the TLR-NP to everyone who
  asked for first kit recommendations, and I in fact still use mine from time to time.
  That was over half a decade ago, though, and as much as I&rsquo;d like to put on
  the nostalgia goggles and relive the TLR&rsquo;s glory days, I&rsquo;ve long since
  come to terms with the fact that they&rsquo;re no longer the competitor they once
  were. The 9Q&rsquo;s better design and increased feature set more than make up for
  the relatively small difference in price. That&rsquo;s my story, and I&rsquo;m sticking
  to it.</p>


  <p><em>[This leaves just one unanswered question in my ask box &ndash; the winner
  of my keyboard-mash fiction challenge, and boy, the prompt&rsquo;s a doozy. I&rsquo;ll
  try to finish that as soon as possible. Stay tuned.]</em></p>'
