So it’s got a lot of problems with its information hierarchy, but I like
the visual impact of *I/O*’s pause menu. The continuously-ticking game
timer is a nice nod to the game’s technology-centered plot, even more so
when you see it at 60 frames per second instead of the 10 I had to
downsample to for this GIF.
