[HTML
Standard](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content-1.html#general-guidelines):

> The most general rule to consider when writing alternative text is the
> following: **the intent is that replacing every image with the text of
> its alt attribute not change the meaning of the page.**
>
> So, in general, alternative text can be written by considering what
> one would have written had one not been able to include the image.
>
> A corollary to this is that <mark>the `alt` attribute’s value should
> never contain text that could be considered the image’s *caption*,
> *title*, or *legend*</mark>. It is supposed to contain replacement
> text that could be used by users *instead* of the image; it is not
> meant to supplement the image. The `title` attribute can be used for
> supplemental information.
>
> Another corollary is that <mark>the `alt` attribute’s value should not
> repeat information that is already provided in the prose next to the
> image</mark>.
