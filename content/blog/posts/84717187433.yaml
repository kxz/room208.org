  <p>How <em>Madoka: Rebellion</em> shows that patching isn&rsquo;t just for video
  games, and why that&rsquo;s a good thing, after the break. Spoilers ahoy!</p>

  <hr><p>If you&rsquo;ve been reading this blog for a while, you may recall that <a
  href="http://blog.room208.org/post/46217750620">I did not like the ending of the
  original <em>Madoka</em> TV series</a>. In short, even if the title character&rsquo;s
  power to make a game-changing wish was consistent with the universe&rsquo;s internal
  rules, it seemed to come so far out of nowhere that it undermined the emotional
  narrative that the rest of the series had taken its time to so painstakingly establish.</p>


  <p>I loved <em>The Rebellion Story</em>&rsquo;s conclusion, on the other hand, and
  not simply because it was dark or contrarian &ndash; it actually reaches back in
  time, in appropriately Homura-esque fashion, to fix the sins its predecessor committed.
  Logically speaking, after all, Homura&rsquo;s countless attempts to save Madoka
  should have inflicted their trauma on her in equal measure to the power it lent
  Madoka&rsquo;s wish. <em>Rebellion</em> ultimately makes good on this promise, by
  using that trauma to transform Homura into an entity powerful enough to counter
  what Madoka became at the end of the TV series. In the process, it changes what
  had been a one-off <em>deus ex machina</em> into a pattern identifiable through
  the narrative alone. The sequel, in essence, justifies its own presence by retroactively
  rewriting the frame through which we see the original.</p>


  <p>Not that this is the only thing that <em>Rebellion</em> has going for it. One
  of my favorite things about long-running SHAFT productions is the way they gradually
  construct a visual language with each installment, applying the same underlying
  principles to new settings. <em>Bakemonogatari</em> revealed its visual world in
  layers, starting with Meme Oshino&rsquo;s hangout, then moving outward and upward
  in scope from a single building to a whole urban metropolis in its final arc. <em>Rebellion</em>
  does much the same thing, taking the unreality of a witch&rsquo;s labyrinth and
  magical combat and painting it on the scale of all of Mitakihara City. And again,
  this all ties back into the narrative &ndash; the eye-popping magnitude of the movie&rsquo;s
  battles isn&rsquo;t just for show, but a subtle hint at the containment of the entire
  world inside an artificial magical realm. The backhanded illumination of the unnatural
  contortions you&rsquo;d have to perform to get a &ldquo;utopian&rdquo; setting,
  where the girls all just get along happily, is just icing on the cake.</p>


  <p>I&rsquo;d previously have said that the original <em>Madoka</em> series was good
  television, but only with some major caveats. With <em>Rebellion</em>, though, the
  franchise has turned what were once narrative flaws completely on their head. When
  I talk about endings, I don&rsquo;t care about whether they&rsquo;re happy or sad,
  just whether they&rsquo;re fitting. In my book, then, this is a good ending.</p>'
