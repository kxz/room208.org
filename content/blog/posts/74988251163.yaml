  \n<blockquote>\n  <p>Just one question - do you, perhaps, have suggestions for alternate\
  \ monospace fonts? And if so, how would I use them in this theme?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
  \n<p>Certainly. The most important thing to note when selecting a typeface is that\
  \ Dichotomy expects normal, bold, and italic styles to all have the same character\
  \ width. For instance, links turn bold when the mouse cursor moves over them, and\
  \ if the typeface you&rsquo;re using has normal and bold fonts with different character\
  \ widths, you&rsquo;re going to end up with text jumping all over the place.</p>\n\
  \n<p>A small digression about browser font synthesis: If you ask for a bold font\
  \ in a font family that doesn&rsquo;t contain one, most browsers will fake one by\
  \ simply doubling some pixels horizontally. Needless to say, this means that the\
  \ mock bold font will not have the same character width as the original. Browsers\
  \ will also synthesize italic fonts when needed by applying a uniform slant to the\
  \ glyphs, but the character width isn&rsquo;t affected by this process, and so it&rsquo;s\
  \ okay if the typeface doesn&rsquo;t have italics. If it does, though, it had better\
  \ also have a separate bold italic font, otherwise bold synthesis will ruin everything\
  \ again.</p>\n\n<p>Dichotomy uses <a href=\"http://font.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu Mono</a>\
  \ by default, which conveniently has regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic variants.\
  \ Early versions used <a href=\"http://lektongroups.blogspot.co.uk/\">Lekton</a>,\
  \ which I liked but unfortunately committed the cardinal sin of having an italic\
  \ without a bold italic.</p>\n\n<h2>Okay, okay, so how do you do it?</h2>\n\n<p>In\
  \ short, head over to <em>Advanced options</em>, and enter something like the following\
  \ in the <em>Custom CSS</em> box:</p>\n\n<pre><code>body {\n    font-family: \"\
  MyFace\", monospace;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;d replace <code>\"MyFace\"\
  </code> with the name of your preferred font family, of course, preserving the quotes.\
  \ That <code>monospace</code> at the end is important to ensure that people who\
  \ can&rsquo;t use the font you specified still get something monospaced. Don&rsquo;t\
  \ leave home without it.</p>\n\n<h2>System fonts</h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;d be great\
  \ if we could pick a monospaced font family that&rsquo;s already installed on everyone&rsquo;s\
  \ computers, so we wouldn&rsquo;t have to add code to download the font files from\
  \ elsewhere. Sadly, it&rsquo;s slim pickings here. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas\"\
  >Consolas</a> comes with Windows and Office these days, and may be your best bet\
  \ on this route. OS X ships a decent version of Courier, but Courier New on Windows\
  \ is thin and spindly and hard to read and I hate it. Don&rsquo;t use it.</p>\n\n\
  <h2>Web fonts</h2>\n\n<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s take a look at some downloadable web\
  \ fonts. This option requires more work, but it carries the advantage that most\
  \ browsers will automatically download the required font files, sidestepping the\
  \ problem of default system availability. Ordinarily, I would point you to <a href=\"\
  https://www.google.com/fonts\">Google Fonts</a> and say, &ldquo;Search away!&rdquo;\
  \ But even though they provide options for searching by various font attributes,\
  \ fixed width is not among them. Never fear, though, because I&rsquo;ve compiled\
  \ a shortlist of typefaces available there that satisfy our criteria:</p>\n\n<ul><li><a\
  \ href=\"https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Anonymous+Pro\">Anonymous Pro</a></li>\n\
  <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Inconsolata\">Inconsolata</a></li>\n\
  <li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Code+Pro\">Source Code\
  \ Pro</a></li>\n</ul><p>(Yow, that really <em>was</em> short.) To use one of these\
  \ fonts, you&rsquo;ll need to follow the <em>Open [font name] in Google Fonts</em>\
  \ link near the top of the specimen page. Check the appropriate styles to include\
  \ &ndash; you&rsquo;ll want at least <em>Normal 400</em> and <em>Bold 700</em>,\
  \ as well as any italic variants if they&rsquo;re present &ndash; then scroll down\
  \ to step 3. Select the <code>@import</code> tab, and copy and paste the code there\
  \ <em>at the top</em> of your custom CSS, before any other declarations. Then change\
  \ the font family name as I mentioned above, and save.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re\
  \ using Dichotomy with custom HTML, this won&rsquo;t work properly due to an oversight\
  \ in versions up to 3.0 &ndash; but in that case I trust you can read <a href=\"\
