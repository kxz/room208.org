description: '<p>After eight months of sitting dormant in a pre-release branch, here&rsquo;s
  a brand-new major version of Dichotomy &ndash; major because it makes a couple of
  backwards-incompatible changes to custom settings. Sorry! I&rsquo;m trying to keep
  those to a minimum for future releases.</p>


  <p>But enough about that. Let&rsquo;s talk about the new features instead! They
  include support for avatars (finally) and using profile header images as backgrounds,
  streamlined desktop layout options, updates to Google Analytics code, and a few
  tiny fixes here and there.</p>


  <p>Version 4.0 will be available on the Tumblr Theme Garden shortly &ndash; at least
  I hope so. As usual, if you have any problems, <a href="http://blog.room208.org/ask">drop
  me a message on Tumblr</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kxz/dichotomy/issues">report
  an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>'
