  <p>Here&rsquo;s my list:</p>


  <ul><li><p><em>Sasami-san@Ganbaranai</em> &ndash; Obligatory SHAFT show.</p></li>

  <li><p><em>Chihayafuru 2</em> &ndash; Obligatory josei show. That and the original
  was one of the best shows to grace the airwaves last year.</p></li>

  <li><p><em>Minami-ke Tadaima</em> &ndash; The <em>Omatase</em> OVA showed promise,
  and I&rsquo;m still laboring under the illusion that <em>Minami-ke</em> might once
  again reach the heights of its first series.</p></li>

  <li><p><em>Robotics;Notes</em> and <em>Psycho-Pass</em> &ndash; Hangers-on from
  the fall. I&rsquo;ve been tempted now and again to drop the former, but I just haven&rsquo;t
  been able to bring myself to do so.</p></li>

  </ul><p>(Yes, every show but one is a continuation or sequel. Deal with it.)</p>'
