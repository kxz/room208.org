So Yoshiura’s new film is getting a prologue, to be released on Nico
Nico Douga sometime this weekend. This is the trailer for that short
<del>film</del> Web series, which I guess makes it a preview of a preview. How
recursive.

It looks like <cite>Patema</cite>’s going to take <cite>Pale
Cocoon</cite>’s endless underground aesthetic and turn up the grungy
desolation a few notches. Most of the sci-fi elements seen there and in
<cite>Time of Eve</cite> seem to be absent, though (note the utter lack
of minimalistic transparent displays). It’s just a big world waiting to
be explored through innocent eyes.

**Edit:** I use the phrase “endless underground aesthetic” a lot.

**Edit II:** &lt;[Nitya](http://mnxmnkmnd.tumblr.com/)&gt; are you
seeing this? this is moe S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

**Edit III:** Correction above. Here’s [the Nico Nico
channel](http://ch.nicovideo.jp/channel/patema), by the way.
