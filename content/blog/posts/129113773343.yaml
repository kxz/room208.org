  <p><code>t</code> appears to be a Base64-encoded token specific to the post, while
  <code>u</code> is just the Base64-encoded URL. The redirector at least checks that
  the token matches the URL so that it can&rsquo;t be used for phishing by setting
  an arbitrary target, which raises the question of why the URL is there in the first
  place, in a format that&rsquo;s opaque to human readers.</p>


  <p>Not following Google&rsquo;s example, the redirect is performed as an HTML <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>
  refresh. This is stupid for a multitude of reasons, not the least of which is that
  it <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3At.umblr.com">confuses clients
  that aren&rsquo;t Web browsers</a>. Moreover, while Google waits until the link
  is clicked on to replace the URL, so the status bar remains useful, Tumblr doesn&rsquo;t.
  This means that there&rsquo;s no visible indication of where a link really points
  if you&rsquo;re not on the dashboard.</p>


  <p>What is the point of all this? Analytics, most likely, though of course given
  Tumblr&rsquo;s remarkable lack of communication about its platform the real reason
  is anyone&rsquo;s guess. What I do know is that it&rsquo;s dumb.</p>'
