  <p>For a little over a year now, I&rsquo;ve been running a series of campaigns set

  genre. I started out using the then-current third draft of Ewen Cluney&rsquo;s <a

  which is openly, and visibly, inspired in large part by the <em>Madoka</em> TV series.

  and turns it into a fairly straightforward tabletop game.</p>

  <hr><p>This first &ldquo;season&rdquo; of my campaign went pretty well, all told,
  but I ended up eventually switching away from <em>Magical Burst</em> for a number
  of reasons. Some of the problems simply stemmed from the system itself still being
  in a beta state, meaning that the rules had some major oversights that I had to
  patch as we went along. This by itself actually wasn&rsquo;t all that much of an
  issue; after all, I didn&rsquo;t have any expectations that something still labeled
  &ldquo;third draft&rdquo; would be perfect, and the unofficial <a href="http://tinyurl.com/MBRewrite"><em>Magical
  Burst ReWrite</em> project</a> plugged some of the more glaring holes.</p>


  <p>The apparent conflict between my style of play and <em>MB</em>&rsquo;s was harder
  to resolve. As someone with an obvious narrativist bent, I could only scratch my
  head at some of the things that <em>MB</em> required die rolls for. The relationship
  mechanics, in particular, were a constant source of bafflement for both myself and
  my players. As a result, even though the player characters often had complicated
  ties to the NPCs and to each other, none of that ended up mattering much when it
  came to the dice-rolling aspects of the game.</p>


  <p><em>MB</em>, too, has a heavy emphasis on combat with witches (or <em>youma</em>,
  as the rulebook refers to them). Now, for a <em>Madoka</em>-like setting, this presents
  a narrative conundrum, because the original series portrays them mostly as forces
  of nature that the antagonists take advantage of, rather than as antagonists themselves.
  Their motivations are never all that clearly outlined, if they even exist to begin
  with. Witches mostly became a sideshow in my campaign as a consequence, existing
  so that the players had a chance to use their magic stats and pull off some cool
  moves every once in a while. Their real opponents were human more often than not,
  a case that <em>MB</em> handles awkwardly at best.</p>


  <p>Perhaps the most fundamental problem, though, lay not with <em>Magical Burst</em>
  per se, but just the unavoidable challenge of adapting <em>Madoka</em> to a roleplaying
  setting in the first place. What makes <em>Madoka</em>&rsquo;s story memorable is
  arguably a combination of two things. The first is the sheer scale of its main conflicts,
  which take place on an almost cosmological level. The battles we see aren&rsquo;t
  just battles between people; they&rsquo;re representations of battles between <em>concepts</em>
  &ndash; emotion against logic, <a href="http://blog.room208.org/post/84717187433">emotion
  against itself</a> &ndash; embodied as people. The second is <em>Madoka</em>&rsquo;s
  willingness to constantly upend the apparent rules of its narrative, in a way that
  remains consistent with itself but not necessarily with the viewer&rsquo;s expectations.
  Neither of these bode well for the ultimately character-driven, mechanical nature
  of your typical roleplaying game.</p>


  <hr><p>These issues by themselves weren&rsquo;t completely fatal to the <em>Magical
  Burst</em> incarnation of my campaign. Ultimately, though, it ended up floundering
  in the face of some player disagreements anyway, so I took the opportunity to go
  back to the drawing board. I knew that I wanted a system that put emphasis on the
  human element, which was already the focus of most of the conflict in the game,
  and perhaps dialed down the importance of witches and other supernatural entities.
  This would push me away from <em>Madoka</em>&rsquo;s aesthetic, but, after the experience
  of a few games, it was becoming clear to me that the tension between characters
  with opposing goals was the most interesting thing that had emerged from the campaign.
  The vivid imagery could be left to our imaginations.</p>


  <p>Around that time, the suggestion of adapting <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> to
  our setting came up. Having run <em>Dogs</em> before, this was an idea that immediately
  appealed to me, especially in the way that its conflict system pushes characters&rsquo;
  motivations straight into the foreground. The biggest challenge, of course, was
  in swapping out the Mormon pioneer milieu of the original game for a magical girl
  facade, but this ended up being mostly a cosmetic change &ndash; fundamentally,
  the mechanics of the game haven&rsquo;t been touched.</p>


  <p>So far, I&rsquo;m mostly satisfied with how things have turned out. What the
  current version of my campaign lacks in explicitly supernatural goings-on, it makes
  up for by more firmly grounding the characters&rsquo; respective struggles. The
  stronger sense of each character&rsquo;s personality in turn informs the decisions
  the players make, and the plots that I construct. Most importantly, it feels less
  like a series of inexplicable things is happening <em>to</em> the characters; instead,
  they&rsquo;re taking an active role in building the narrative, no matter how halting
  that might be from time to time. To me, that&rsquo;s what makes a game interesting.</p>


  <p>And, hey, I can always have a witch bite one of their heads off later.</p>'

    \ board. I knew that I wanted a system that put emphasis on the human element,\
    \ which was already the focus of most of the conflict in the game, and perhaps\
    \ dialed down the importance of witches and other supernatural entities. This\
    \ would push me away from <em>Madoka</em>\u2019s aesthetic, but, after the experience\
    \ of a few games, it was becoming clear to me that the tension between characters\
    \ with opposing goals was the most interesting thing that had emerged from the\
    \ campaign. The vivid imagery could be left to our imaginations.</p>\n\n<p>Around\
    \ that time, the suggestion of adapting <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> to our setting\
    \ came up. Having run <em>Dogs</em> before, this was an idea that immediately\
    \ appealed to me, especially in the way that its conflict system pushes characters\u2019\
    \ motivations straight into the foreground. The biggest challenge, of course,\
    \ was in swapping out the Mormon pioneer milieu of the original game for a magical\
    \ girl facade, but this ended up being mostly a cosmetic change \u2013 fundamentally,\
    \ the mechanics of the game haven\u2019t been touched.</p>\n\n<p>So far, I\u2019\
    m mostly satisfied with how things have turned out. What the current version of\
    \ my campaign lacks in explicitly supernatural goings-on, it makes up for by more\
    \ firmly grounding the characters\u2019 respective struggles. The stronger sense\
    \ of each character\u2019s personality in turn informs the decisions the players\
    \ make, and the plots that I construct. Most importantly, it feels less like a\
    \ series of inexplicable things is happening <em>to</em> the characters; instead,\
    \ they\u2019re taking an active role in building the narrative, no matter how\
    \ halting that might be from time to time. To me, that\u2019s what makes a game\
    \ interesting.</p>\n\n<p>And, hey, I can always have a witch bite one of their\
    \ heads off later.</p>"
