The recent [3.0 release of
Dichotomy](http://blog.room208.org/post/74885758562) is now available
through the Tumblr Theme Garden, for your one-click installation
pleasure. Note that Tumblr has a nasty tendency to reset user theme
settings when upgrading themes, so existing Dichotomy users will want to
visit the [Customize page](http://www.tumblr.com/customize) and make a
copy of their current preferences before taking the plunge. (Though,
honestly, black and white and gray ought to be enough for anyone.)
