By the way, [the Tumblr FAQ](http://www.tumblr.com/help) is lying when
it says that “Read More is only available for Text posts that are
created using the Rich Text Editor.” You can actually do it in the raw
HTML and Markdown editing modes by simply inserting `<!-- more -->`
where you want the “Read More” break to be. Yeah, it’s that easy.
