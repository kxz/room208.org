  <p>Yasuhiro Yoshiura is back with another film, after running a victory lap with
  the theatrical version of <cite>Time of Eve</cite>. This one looks to be combining
  the endless underground aesthetic of <cite>Pale Cocoon</cite> with a more expansive
  outside world; he talks about really going outdoors for the first time, so to speak,
  in his director&rsquo;s note. It&rsquo;s scheduled to hit Japanese theaters sometime
  this year.</p>


  <p>Not many more details so far, but I love the promotional art.</p>'
