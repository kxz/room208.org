I poked around today to see if I could use the Tumblr API to change the
type of an existing post, a task that [I’ve previously shown how to do
with form twiddling](/blog/posts/64244275772.html). It turns
out that the API cheerfully ignores the `type` parameter in requests,
which I probably should have checked before spending a couple of hours
on installing stuff and putting together the foundations of a
simple-yet-classy web app in Flask. Oh, well.

Long story short: If you want to change the type of a post, messing
around with the dashboard’s HTML remains the only way to do it that I
know of. Surely Tumblr could actually support this in its UI?
