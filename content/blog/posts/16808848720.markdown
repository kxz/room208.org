@[queentakesking](http://blog.redono.org/) wrote a post a while back on
[what would be needed to decentralize
Tumblr](http://blog.redono.org/post/11925825689/a-proposal-on-decentralizing-tumblr),
essentially turning it from a service with a single provider into a
protocol with many implementations. I’m not sure how I didn’t realize it
when the proposal was first posted, but a lot of the desired
functionality already exists in some interoperable fashion. Reblogs, in
particular, could be implemented in part with trackbacks, which Movable
Type first introduced ten years ago and have since made their way to
WordPress and a lot of other self-hosted blogging software; this would
handle the essential functionality of pinging authors. Quoting the
original text is harder, given that there’s no standard way of
indicating a post’s actual content in an HTML page, but it isn’t an
intractable problem, and should at least be trivial for reblogs between
users of the same service. Similarly, following other users is largely a
solved problem given that RSS exists. Essentially, if you want a look at
what a decentralized Tumblr might entail, take a look at the blogosphere
circa… oh, 2006.
