  <p>I have to say that this anime season has had a disappointing trend of otherwise
  stellar shows with less-than-stellar endings. First came <em>Chuu2koi</em>, whose
  conclusion wasn&rsquo;t terrible, but went overboard in trying to re-establish the
  lighthearted tone of its first several episodes. Now we have <em>My Little Monster</em>,
  which was actually already struggling by about two-thirds of the way through the
  season &ndash; as the later episodes wore on, the key relationship between Haru
  and Shizuku just about stagnated, and the main cast&rsquo;s antics lost their freshness
  as a result. I know there&rsquo;s a possibility that the show&rsquo;s producers
  are leaving open a hook for a second season, but the fact that they ran out of momentum
  partway through the first doesn&rsquo;t speak well to a potential sequel&rsquo;s
  prospects. With that in mind, I can only recommend watching <em>My Little Monster</em>
  if you stop about halfway through the series, while it&rsquo;s still hilarious and
  quite perceptive.</p>


  <p>That being said, it&rsquo;s better than what I&rsquo;m expecting from the three
  episodes of <em>Say &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</em> that I haven&rsquo;t yet gotten
  around to.</p>'
