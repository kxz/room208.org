  \n<p>Sayuri stared idly at the projector screen, her mind having long since strayed\
  \ from the meeting at hand, her team&rsquo;s project, or even work in general. The\
  \ only thing keeping her from completely shutting down was the insistent coffee-induced\

  \ at the beginning of Q2&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>As the presenter droned on about\
  \ things that she already knew, Sayuri noticed a familiar glow coming from inside\
  \ her handbag. She rifled around inside and pulled out her cell phone. &ldquo;New\
  \ text messages,&rdquo; the screen read. Discreetly pushing a few buttons, she pulled\
  \ up her inbox.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I&rsquo;ve got a new assignment for you.\
  \ Meet me at 7:25. Usual place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr><p>No matter how many\
  \ times she went up to the top of the Akigase Tower, Sayuri always felt a tinge\
  \ of vertigo when she opened the roof door. Something about the commanding view\
  \ of the city just overwhelmed her senses. She suspected that was why <em>he</em>\
  \ liked this place to begin with.</p>\n\n<p><em>He</em>, of course, was the cutesy-looking\
  \ mishmash of every huggable animal in existence that was, at that moment, sitting\
  \ on the safety railing, taking in the sunset. His long, feathery tail curled around\
  \ one of the vertical posts, as if he were using it to anchor himself.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Good\
  \ evening, Pyunpyun.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hi, Sayuri,&rdquo; Pyunpyun said, his\
  \ eyes remaining fixed on the crimson sky in front of him. &ldquo;How have you been?&rdquo;</p>\n\
  \n<p>Sayuri leaned against the railing and joined Pyunpyun in gazing at the horizon.\
  \ &ldquo;Oh, just running up against another deployment deadline at work. Constant\
  \ meetings, overtime that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to take if I weren&rsquo;t spending\
  \ all my time in meetings, no sleep, constant fatigue. That on top of the stress\
  \ of getting Reina ready for her new school. You know, tip-top condition.&rdquo;</p>\n\
  \n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. It must be tough.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,\
  \ yeah,&rdquo; Sayuri said dismissively.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;m\
  \ not an amoral monster unconcerned with your well-being, Sayuri. We&rsquo;ve been\
  \ working together for twenty years now. You know me better than that.&rdquo;</p>\n\
  \n<p>&ldquo;Really? I thought you could never be sure with magic&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\
  \n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been watching too much television. Besides, you fulfilled\
  \ the terms of our agreement a long, long time ago. You wouldn&rsquo;t keep working\
  \ with us if you really didn&rsquo;t want to, and we need you. Sometimes &ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n\
  \n<p>&ldquo;&ndash; there really is no one else who can handle the job, I know.\
  \ But between my real job&rdquo; &ndash; Sayuri stumbled as Pyunpyun rolled his\
  \ eyes &ndash; &ldquo;ugh, you know what I mean &ndash; okay, my <em>other</em>\
  \ job, and my daughter, and&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure you see how the timing could\
  \ have been better.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I understand. And you don&rsquo;t have\
  \ to take this one if you don&rsquo;t feel up to it. Just hear me out first.&rdquo;</p>\n\
  \n<p>&ldquo;Okay, fine. I&rsquo;m all ears.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sayuri glanced at Pyunpyun\
  \ out of the corner of her vision. The creature&rsquo;s green eyes moved back and\
  \ forth, as if he were reading a dossier off of the clouds in the distance.</p>\n\
  \n<p>&ldquo;One of the girls disappeared a few nights ago. Chisato Miyajima &ndash;\
  \ fourteen years old, lives in Setagaya &ndash; was last seen walking home from\
  \ school on the 28th. She&rsquo;s an absolute prodigy. Can reduce common field-casting\
  \ beings to cinders and ash in seconds. Anything with enough magic to subdue her\
  \ would have drawn a lot of attention. But she&rsquo;s not the strongest physically.\
  \ No enemy field, no powers. A non-magical kidnapper could take her with little\
  \ issue, so that might be the most likely explanation, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n\
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that simple.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Right.\
  \ I also think she was marked.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;By one of the sects?&rdquo;</p>\n\
  \n<p>Pyunpyun nodded. &ldquo;Like I said, she&rsquo;s a prodigy. So much so that\
  \ she managed, about two weeks ago, to take out a high-level dark caster twice her\
  \ age. Impressive, but there&rsquo;s one problem: this one happened to be a recent\
  \ inductee into the Seventh Seal.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Sayuri&rsquo;s posture slumped.\
  \ &ldquo;I had a feeling they&rsquo;d be involved.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,\
  \ they have been getting a lot more powerful lately. Truth be told, though, I&rsquo;m\
  \ hoping that if someone <em>did</em> take Chisato, it was them. If it was just\
  \ some psycho on the streets of Shimokitazawa, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do but\
  \ hope the police catch him. But we know how to track the Seal down, and fight them.\
  \ <em>You</em> know how.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>A soft breeze tousled Sayuri&rsquo;s hair.\
  \ She looked down at the ground forty-six stories below, the street lamps and headlights\
  \ of passing cars shining against the darkening sky.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;All right,\
  \ count me in.&rdquo;</p>"

    \ up her inbox.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I\u2019ve got a new assignment for you.\
    \ Meet me at 7:25. Usual place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr><p>No matter how many\
    \ times she went up to the top of the Akigase Tower, Sayuri always felt a tinge\
    \ of vertigo when she opened the roof door. Something about the commanding view\
    \ of the city just overwhelmed her senses. She suspected that was why <em>he</em>\
    \ liked this place to begin with.</p>\n\n<p><em>He</em>, of course, was the cutesy-looking\
    \ mishmash of every huggable animal in existence that was, at that moment, sitting\
    \ on the safety railing, taking in the sunset. His long, feathery tail curled\
    \ around one of the vertical posts, as if he were using it to anchor himself.</p>\n\
    \n<p>\u201CGood evening, Pyunpyun.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CHi, Sayuri,\u201D Pyunpyun\
    \ said, his eyes remaining fixed on the crimson sky in front of him. \u201CHow\
    \ have you been?\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Sayuri leaned against the railing and joined\
    \ Pyunpyun in gazing at the horizon. \u201COh, just running up against another\
    \ deployment deadline at work. Constant meetings, overtime that I wouldn\u2019\
    t have to take if I weren\u2019t spending all my time in meetings, no sleep, constant\
    \ fatigue. That on top of the stress of getting Reina ready for her new school.\
    \ You know, tip-top condition.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\
    \ It must be tough.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CYeah, yeah,\u201D Sayuri said dismissively.</p>\n\
    \n<p>\u201CNo, it\u2019s true. I\u2019m not an amoral monster unconcerned with\
    \ your well-being, Sayuri. We\u2019ve been working together for twenty years now.\
    \ You know me better than that.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CReally? I thought you could\
    \ never be sure with magic\u2026\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CYou\u2019ve been watching\
    \ too much television. Besides, you fulfilled the terms of our agreement a long,\
    \ long time ago. You wouldn\u2019t keep working with us if you really didn\u2019\
    t want to, and we need you. Sometimes \u2013\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201C\u2013 there\
    \ really is no one else who can handle the job, I know. But between my real job\u201D\
    \ \u2013 Sayuri stumbled as Pyunpyun rolled his eyes \u2013 \u201Cugh, you know\
    \ what I mean \u2013 okay, my <em>other</em> job, and my daughter, and\u2026 I\u2019\
    m sure you see how the timing could have been better.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CI\
    \ understand. And you don\u2019t have to take this one if you don\u2019t feel\
    \ up to it. Just hear me out first.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201COkay, fine. I\u2019\
    m all ears.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Sayuri glanced at Pyunpyun out of the corner of her\
    \ vision. The creature\u2019s green eyes moved back and forth, as if he were reading\
    \ a dossier off of the clouds in the distance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201COne of the girls\
    \ disappeared a few nights ago. Chisato Miyajima \u2013 fourteen years old, lives\
    \ in Setagaya \u2013 was last seen walking home from school on the 28th. She\u2019\
    s an absolute prodigy. Can reduce common field-casting beings to cinders and ash\
    \ in seconds. Anything with enough magic to subdue her would have drawn a lot\
    \ of attention. But she\u2019s not the strongest physically. No enemy field, no\
    \ powers. A non-magical kidnapper could take her with little issue, so that might\
    \ be the most likely explanation, but\u2026\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CYou don\u2019\
    t think it\u2019s that simple.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CRight. I also think she was\
    \ marked.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CBy one of the sects?\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Pyunpyun\
    \ nodded. \u201CLike I said, she\u2019s a prodigy. So much so that she managed,\
    \ about two weeks ago, to take out a high-level dark caster twice her age. Impressive,\
    \ but there\u2019s one problem: this one happened to be a recent inductee into\
    \ the Seventh Seal.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>Sayuri\u2019s posture slumped. \u201CI had\
    \ a feeling they\u2019d be involved.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>\u201CYes, they have been\
    \ getting a lot more powerful lately. Truth be told, though, I\u2019m hoping that\
    \ if someone <em>did</em> take Chisato, it was them. If it was just some psycho\
    \ on the streets of Shimokitazawa, there\u2019s nothing we can do but hope the\
    \ police catch him. But we know how to track the Seal down, and fight them. <em>You</em>\
    \ know how.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>A soft breeze tousled Sayuri\u2019s hair. She looked\
    \ down at the ground forty-six stories below, the street lamps and headlights\
    \ of passing cars shining against the darkening sky.</p>\n\n<p>\u201CAll right,\
    \ count me in.\u201D</p>"
