answer: '<p>Glad to help!</p>


  <p>As far as I&rsquo;m aware, there&rsquo;s no way to do this. Allowing author changes
  incautiously could cause real problems &ndash; a malicious user could make someone
  else the author of an unflattering post, or take authorship of a good one. It&rsquo;s
  also possible that Tumblr&rsquo;s code assumes that the currently logged-in user
  is the one posting in enough places to make implementing author changes a headache.
  Arguably, if you&rsquo;re a blog admin, you should still have the power to change
  authorship among the members of that blog, but until Tumblr explicitly announces
  such a feature, don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>'
