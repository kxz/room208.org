<p>It’s been too long, but I don’t really have much to say, so let’s
have another list like <a href="/blog/posts/70728179447.html">I did two
years ago</a>. Maybe this time with some more words.</p>

<p>In approximate order from best to even better.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Your Lie in April</em> (<em>Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso</em>).
The premise invites comparisons to <em>Nodame Cantabile</em>, which I
think do this show a disservice — it never professes to be as mature or
as musically rigorous, and holding it to that standard is rather unfair.
While the dramatic turns do sometimes get predictable and circuitous,
the show’s most beautiful moments make up for that. Yes, the intense
swells of the score help.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Prison School</em>. On the flip side, this is a series that
no one in their right mind would take seriously at first glance. If you
can get over its unabashed attachment to the lowbrow, though, you’ll be
floored by how tightly the narrative is constructed, how the characters
play off each other, and how the lewd, lurid, and juvenile actually fit
into a plot where everyone seems to be a chessmaster. <em>Prison
School</em> is the sort of work that lulls you into low expectations
before proceeding to ambush you with competence. Or, <a href=
"https://twitter.com/cdv2722/status/682110594540007425">as I put it on
Twitter</a>, if some anime are junk food, this is Alton Brown teaching
you how to deep-fry Snickers.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Noragami Aragoto</em>. Where the first series is overly
focused on the whiny teenage rebellion of Yukine, played a bit too
pitch-perfectly by Yuuki Kaji, the sequel gives us the <em>shounen</em>
battles of wills that we waited a whole season to see. The evolving
rivalry between Yato and Bishamon serves as the foundation for the rest
of the show’s events, and it gives us a great sense of scale as other
conflicts around them get broader and nastier. My only disappointment is
with the ending theme, which isn’t quite as good as the last one. Alas,
you can’t win ’em all.</p></li>

<li><p><em>My Love Story!!</em> (<em>Ore Monogatari!!</em>). It’s what
love would be like if love were about being as masculine as possible
while simultaneously being as <em>shoujo</em> as possible. This sounds
clearly self-contradictory, but much like with <em>Monthly Girls’
Nozaki</em>’s anarchic approach to <em>shoujo</em> clichés, it’s why the
show works. The more ridiculous moments, like the protagonist saving his
girlfriend from a literal falling I-beam by just holding it up, give the
romance room to breathe without suffocating on an excess of
self-seriousness. At the same time, <em>My Love Story!!</em> never
stoops to mocking its characters — it really is just love, with a good
old infusion of very hot blood.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Shirobako</em>. It’s an anime about anime, which could have
been a horrible exercise in navel-gazing, but ends up being the closest
thing to genuinely fun edutainment that the medium has given us since
<em>Moyashimon</em>. (If only the word “edutainment” didn’t sound so
stupid.) We get an only-moderately-exaggerated sense of how the sausage
is made, while P.A. Works gets in a sly wink and a nod about the foibles
of themselves and their competitors. Seriously, did anyone <em>not</em>
immediately think of Akiyuki Shinbou and <em>Madoka</em>?</p></li>

<li><p><em>Working!!!</em> Just as fun as the first two seasons, except
things actually happen. I’d ordinarily shy away from spoilers, but come
on, we all know who’s finally shacking up. The important part is that
the warm, fuzzy moments come without betraying the adorably neurotic
personalities of the characters we’ve come to love. Or at least laugh
at in twenty-four-minute increments.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Owarimonogatari</em>. I’ve mentioned before that my ability
to objectively evaluate the quality of any <em>Monogatari Series</em>
installment has probably long been compromised, but this installment
really does strike me as another high note, after the mildly muddled
mess that is the <em>Tsukimonogatari</em> miniseries. Marina Inoue,
mostly known for playing boisterous characters like <em>Minami-ke</em>’s
Kana, balances out her performance as Sodachi Oikura with a remarkable
vulnerability and nuance. The show’s second arc doesn’t shine quite as
brightly, but still brings enough twists and turns to keep us wanting
more — and, of course, that typographically-endowed flair isn’t going
anywhere.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>See you in 2017! You should watch <em>Erased</em>, because unless it
totally squibs its ending, it’s going to be on this list then.</p>

<p>Also, I guess I lied about not having much to say.</p>
