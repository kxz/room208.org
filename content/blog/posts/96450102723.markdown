It’s common for Japanese text to use quotation marks for emphasis or to
indicate idiosyncratic usage, which isn’t considered improper to the
degree that it is with English. Incidentally, the construction “the name
of ‘that’ realm” also probably arises from translating the set phrase
<span lang="ja">XというY</span> too literally; a direct translation would
be “the Y named/called X,” but nine times out of ten this sounds
redundant or out of place in English, and a simple appositive would
suffice instead.

The more you know.
