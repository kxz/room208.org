A (Tumblr!) blog documenting the OpenBSD team’s [recently-initiated
remodeling of
OpenSSL](https://pay.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/232mte/openbsd_has_started_a_massive_stripdown_and/).
I hate to be too hard on the OpenSSL developers, since they’ve already
gotten more than enough flak these past couple of weeks, but some of the
code that’s being chucked out is just horrifying – for example, [private
key material may sometimes be used as a PRNG entropy
source](http://opensslrampage.org/post/83007010531/well-even-if-time-isnt-random-your-rsa-private-key).
I know keys look random, but come *on*.
