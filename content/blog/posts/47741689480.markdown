There’s something to be said for how relaxed *Aiura* manages to feel in
spite of the fact that its episodes are literally four minutes long.
More than anything, it might be a testament to how brevity is often
better than overstaying one’s welcome. After all, when it’s all said and
done, I’d prefer wanting more of a series to growing tired of it.
