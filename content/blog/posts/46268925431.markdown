Updates to Elaborate Burn’s custom theme:

-   Content Midground, which sets the background color for block quotes
    and other elements, is no longer determined by a single text field,
    but two separate color and opacity fields. This makes changing the
    setting easier for users unfamiliar with CSS.

    (Tumblr only recently added the `{RGBcolor:}` theme tag that makes
    this possible. It outputs colors as an RGB triplet in the form
    `123,45,67`, instead of the default hex `#7b2d43` given by
    `{color:}`.)

-   The base font size for narrow viewports, such as mobile devices, has
    been increased from 14px to 18px for ease of reading.

-   The default link to Tumblr’s archive page can now be hidden.

-   Largely meaningless version numbers have been added.
