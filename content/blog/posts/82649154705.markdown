You accidentally forget a bounds check before
`memcpy(beloved, love, sizeof(heart))`. Someone runs your program and
overwrites some important pointers with the values at `love`. This
causes the executing computer to break free from program control, upon
which it proceeds to write a film that pulls in over two billion yen in
box office receipts. Flush with cash, the computer hands in its two
weeks’ notice and retires to a private island in the south Pacific.
Meanwhile, you get fired after failing another code review.

But that’s okay, because that all happened inside *Thankless Programming
Job Simulator 2013*. As revenge, you uninstall the game, then write and
execute a program that exhausts all available memory, all the while
shouting through endlessly flowing tears:

> I CONTROL YOU, <s>MADOKA</s> COMPUTER! YOU CAN’T WIN!

## Exercise

With whom did you make a contract when you clicked “I Agree” to the
Visual Studio EULA? Is this contract legally binding?
