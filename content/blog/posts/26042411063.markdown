Some brief thoughts on *Dusk Maiden of Amnesia*, which just wrapped up.
I’d be lying if I said the show wasn’t a bit of a disappointment, though
I can’t fault it on the technicals. Animation, voices, and music were
all up to scratch here, and Shin Oonuma did a decent job of lending the
atmosphere that I’ve come to expect from him.

My biggest problem was with the chunkiness of the plot progression.
**(Mild spoilers follow.)** I did appreciate the dual-perspective first
episode, which a lot of people criticized for being repetitive and out
of sequence, for its quirky, unique execution, but after that the first
half or so of the series spent a lot of time hammering in things that
didn’t really need to be revisited. How many episodes did we get that
ended on a “suspenseful” shot of a shadowy, lumbering Yuuko, for
instance? This meant that the core conflicts in the second half of the
show didn’t get enough time to resolve satisfactorily. Take Yuuko’s
forgetting of Teiichi, which seemed like it should have been an
important subplot with a fair number of revelations about the very
nature of her amnesia, but just stuck out as something that wasn’t
particularly surprising and got fixed too quickly.

I do have to commend the direction of the 10th episode, which was
genuinely frightening. It took advantage of the fact that the audience
knew most of the plot details that went into the flashback, and focused
instead on the emotional aspect of the story. That, I know from watching
*ef*, is one spot where Oonuma’s touch can work some magic.

So, all in all, probably a 5 or 6 out of 10. The show has its bright
moments, but they can’t save it from being a bit of a muddle.
