[21-Apr-2013 02:28:21]  <CharlaGM> CPL Chapeau: "I believe in him. A universe this perverse takes a sick mind to devise."
[21-Apr-2013 02:28:27]  <TrooperAmemiya> If such a god exists he's a total asshole
[21-Apr-2013 02:29:17]  <CharlaGM> (I blame Barcode entirely for this. He said I'd better be able to think of sufficiently-interesting foes after he read about a game involving dinosaur commandoes.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:29:35]  <Barcode> ((wh-b- ghm-))
[21-Apr-2013 02:29:43]  <TrooperBlake> (That just makes me think of Nanosaur for some reason.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:29:45]  <CharlaGM> (So what was my first thought? Sharkmen with frickin' laser beams on their heads.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:29:53]  <CharlaGM> (FUCK YEAH NANOSAUR.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:29:57]  <Alan_Walsh> (/me applauds)
[21-Apr-2013 02:30:07]  <Lin_Chong> (we need Super Dinosaur on this)
[21-Apr-2013 02:30:15]  <TrooperBlake> (I swear, I think that game had as much fog as Turok.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:30:27]  <Barcode> ((quick recap who's everyone, I know it's stones jbridge bgtb lin(?) and what, jackamckerel?))
[21-Apr-2013 02:30:28]  <TrooperAmemiya> (I wonder what their native god's/gods' name(s) is/are)
[21-Apr-2013 02:30:33]  <TrooperBlake> (Or maybe just odd draw distance)
[21-Apr-2013 02:30:34]  <Alan_Walsh> (KRYPTONITE FOG)
[21-Apr-2013 02:30:36]  <CharlaGM> (It was reverse-Turok, you were the dinosaur killing everything else.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:30:39]  <TrooperBlake> (I'm RocketDude, Barcode)

[21-Apr-2013 02:32:41]  <Alan_Walsh> ( CharlaGM: By the way, do you have the 2hu folder now?)
[21-Apr-2013 02:32:55]  <CharlaGM> "Usual standard procedure here: Seek and destroy. They're aggressive but not particularly motivated. Go make the beautiful beaches safe for Terra. Any questions?"
[21-Apr-2013 02:33:13]  <CharlaGM> (Not yet. Still busy. x_x I'll try and nab errything Tuesday.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:33:20]  <Lin_Chong> Sir, your lack of enthusiasm is inspiring.
[21-Apr-2013 02:33:21]  <Alan_Walsh> (Shore.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:33:45]  * TrooperBlake is tempted to ask "Yes, Captain, I have one: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?!"
[21-Apr-2013 02:33:47]  <Lin_Chong> I wish that I had the lack attachment that you had.
[21-Apr-2013 02:33:52]  <TrooperAmemiya> Are the sharkpeople edible?
[21-Apr-2013 02:33:57]  <Lin_Chong> The lack of attachment that you have.
[21-Apr-2013 02:34:31]  <Cpldrake> I have question
[21-Apr-2013 02:34:52]  <CharlaGM> "Yes, Trooper Amemiya, they're edible. I'm told they need more salt, though."
[21-Apr-2013 02:35:15]  <Cpldrake> Are we allowed to use postage to send bodies of shark-people to home? It would be a great day for Volg
[21-Apr-2013 02:36:17]  <Lin_Chong> The shark corpses are impermanent.
[21-Apr-2013 02:36:20]  <CharlaGM> CAPT Irmiah stares out past CPL Drake for a few seconds. This is not the sort of question he is routinely asked.
[21-Apr-2013 02:36:47]  * TrooperBlake slowly turns head towards CPL Drake
[21-Apr-2013 02:37:11]  <CharlaGM> "Yes, but there is a weight limit."
[21-Apr-2013 02:37:57]  <Cpldrake> "That good, only need to send enough for my cousin Drake's birthday, and another for my other cousin Drake's funeral"
[21-Apr-2013 02:38:40]  * TrooperAmemiya glances at CPL Drake
[21-Apr-2013 02:38:48]  * TrooperBlake stares in disbelief
[21-Apr-2013 02:39:09]  <Lin_Chong> Fuck fish, yes?
[21-Apr-2013 02:39:11]  <CharlaGM> CPL Chapeau: "Your family is brilliantly imaginative at naming their children."
[21-Apr-2013 02:39:44]  <TrooperBlake> Look who's talking, Chapeau.
[21-Apr-2013 02:39:51]  <Cpldrake> "Thank you Chapeau, most people just see that we are all named Drake and forget the sublities
[21-Apr-2013 02:40:09]  <Cpldrake> Since Cousin Drake is pronounced Drake, while my other Cousin is pronounced Drake
[21-Apr-2013 02:40:14]  <Cpldrake> big difference, you can hear, yes?
[21-Apr-2013 02:40:15]  <CharlaGM> "...Blake. Sorry."
[21-Apr-2013 02:40:32]  <TrooperBlake> Oh, now you're talking to me?
[21-Apr-2013 02:40:57]  <TrooperAmemiya> (IPA would be nice)
[21-Apr-2013 02:41:51]  <CharlaGM> CAPT Irmiah: "If there are no further concerns, get your gear checked and ready, report for tactical database assimilation in one hour, we drop at 1030 hours. Head 'em out."
[21-Apr-2013 02:42:41]  <Alan_Walsh> "Yessir."
[21-Apr-2013 02:42:55]  * TrooperBlake strolls off towards armory
[21-Apr-2013 02:44:58]  <CharlaGM> Quartermaster Briggs is busy opening the storage lockers for the company's Mandlebrite suits. "Don't go trick-r-treatin' without your costumes, kids!"
[21-Apr-2013 02:45:54]  <TrooperAmemiya> (I will now forever be disappointed if armour merchants in games don't say this line)
[21-Apr-2013 02:46:11]  * Alan_Walsh puts on his suit, satisfied with the customizations he's made to his armor.
[21-Apr-2013 02:46:35]  <Lin_Chong> Do we have any paint?
[21-Apr-2013 02:46:45]  * TrooperBlake dons armor as well, which happens to have a smiley face painted on it
[21-Apr-2013 02:46:51]  <TrooperAmemiya> I beleive we acquire that in the field
[21-Apr-2013 02:46:59]  <Cpldrake> hmm
[21-Apr-2013 02:47:15]  <Cpldrake> .decide go with pants|pants are not needed to see where we are going
[21-Apr-2013 02:47:27]  * TrooperAmemiya equips his armour
[21-Apr-2013 02:47:28]  <Cpldrake> (you fail me again
[21-Apr-2013 02:47:31]  <Alan_Walsh> ("Where we're going, we don't need pants.")
[21-Apr-2013 02:47:33]  <CharlaGM> "Yeah, we got paint. Why?"
[21-Apr-2013 02:47:44]  <Barcode> ((whot augh yew boyin'?))
[21-Apr-2013 02:47:51]  <Cpldrake> It looks like today I wear pants
[21-Apr-2013 02:47:56]  <Cpldrake> but tomorrow I will be sober
[21-Apr-2013 02:47:58]  <Lin_Chong> I want to write something on my armor plates.
[21-Apr-2013 02:47:58]  <CharlaGM> (Barcde: PFFFFT.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:48:19]  <CharlaGM> "Feh, sure. What color? Don't miss the drop just because you wanna do arts-n-crafts, though!"
[21-Apr-2013 02:48:42]  <Lin_Chong> (what color is the armor)
[21-Apr-2013 02:48:44]  * Cpldrake goes back to get his equipment, comes back with some scratchy looking armor covered in scorch marks
[21-Apr-2013 02:49:37]  <CharlaGM> (Plaster white, plating with black/brick red cables and shit in the seams and joints.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:49:45]  <Lin_Chong> Black.
[21-Apr-2013 02:50:31]  <CharlaGM> "Here ya go. Pray it don't wash off in the surf!"
[21-Apr-2013 02:51:55]  <Lin_Chong> Three lines on the back of the head. On the right arm is another three, but the first two have gaps in the middle.
[21-Apr-2013 02:52:38]  <Lin_Chong> On the right bracer the same, broken line-intact-line-broken line. 
[21-Apr-2013 02:53:36]  <CharlaGM> (Lin: Feel free to write that down on the Google doc)
[21-Apr-2013 02:53:53]  <CharlaGM> (Also I apologize if I am drawing out the briefing. My fault entirely.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:54:48]  <CharlaGM> LT Fendel is already in her armor, sidearm holstered, energy rifle slung across her back, and pointing a vicious-looking PowerClaw at those she deems insufficiently enthusiastic.
[21-Apr-2013 02:54:54]  <TrooperBlake> Can't forget the toys! *Walks over to weapons locker, picks up pump-action grenade launcher, admiring it.*
[21-Apr-2013 02:55:06]  <CharlaGM> "I DO NOT DETECT ENOUGH EAGERNESS FOR SHARK-KILLING HERE! PICK UP THE FUCKING PACE!"
[21-Apr-2013 02:56:34]  * Cpldrake takes out a gigantic cannon, on the side is written "Ralph"
[21-Apr-2013 02:56:40]  * TrooperAmemiya collects slug rifle, draws the charging handle fully rearwards, and checks the chamber
[21-Apr-2013 02:57:22]  * Alan_Walsh retrieves his flechette gun, making sure everything's in order.
[21-Apr-2013 02:57:29]  <Cpldrake> "I had pig named Ralph. He squealed a lot. I gutted him and used his body to keep brother warm. good memories
[21-Apr-2013 02:57:51]  * TrooperBlake checks to see if his grenade launcher is loaded. Scowling at the lack of grenades, he makes a note to load them before the drop and takes his sidearm with him.
[21-Apr-2013 02:58:16]  <TrooperBlake> Surprised he wasn't called Drake as well
[21-Apr-2013 02:58:22]  <CharlaGM> Quartermaster Briggs: "Ain't Halloween without candy! Ya'll git yer ammo!"
[21-Apr-2013 02:58:24]  <TrooperBlake> (*.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:58:27]  <Lin_Chong> I retrieve my pistol and rifle.
[21-Apr-2013 02:58:57]  <Cpldrake> Blake do I need to bring up Amarillo Again
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:12]  <Alan_Walsh> "Oh yeah, almos' forgot these."
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:13]  <CharlaGM> LT Fendel: "Hurry up HURRY UP HURRY HURRY HURRY GET SOME GET SOME GET SOME GET SOME."
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:14]  <TrooperAmemiya> (is it safe to assume hand grenades are included with ammo?)
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:19]  * Lin_Chong packs another good portion of spare ammunition. 
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:19]  * Alan_Walsh snags grenades from the table.
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:20]  <CharlaGM> (Yes.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:23]  * TrooperBlake rushes over, cramming grenades into the magazine of his launcher, and stashing more away elsewhere, while tucking some pistol mags away.
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:28]  <Alan_Walsh> (Wait, shit. Ignore that last bit.0
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:34]  * TrooperAmemiya retreives magazines and grenades
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:40]  <Alan_Walsh> (Or not.)
[21-Apr-2013 02:59:53]  <Lin_Chong> Hold the horses, Fendel. Patience is not permanence.
[21-Apr-2013 03:00:05]  <CharlaGM> "FUCK PERMANENCE I WANT TO KILL SHIT."
[21-Apr-2013 03:00:17]  * TrooperAmemiya inserts a magazine into his slug rifle and hits the bolt release
[21-Apr-2013 03:00:19]  * TrooperBlake jogs after Fendel, saying "Oh hell yeah!"
[21-Apr-2013 03:00:29]  <Cpldrake> Lin has a point, we could all die because Lin is contemplating the permanence of sand
[21-Apr-2013 03:00:35]  *** Barcode <~Barcode@dhcp-0-18-e7-f8-27-1.cpe.sourcecable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Livin' on borrowed time.)
[21-Apr-2013 03:00:38]  <Cpldrake> So we need to bring other people so they can die for us
[21-Apr-2013 03:00:47]  * TrooperAmemiya suppresses a laugh
[21-Apr-2013 03:00:56]  <Lin_Chong> I mean patience is not /impermanence/.
[21-Apr-2013 03:01:16]  <CharlaGM> "FUCKING HANGAR, EVERYBODY, DOUBLETIME THAT SHIT."
[21-Apr-2013 03:01:17]  <Cpldrake> I vote for meatshields
[21-Apr-2013 03:01:33]  * Cpldrake heads out to do some killing
[21-Apr-2013 03:01:57]  * Alan_Walsh heads to the hanger, considerably more chipper than he was half an hour ago.
[21-Apr-2013 03:02:06]  <Lin_Chong> wee
[21-Apr-2013 03:02:14]  * TrooperBlake enthusiastically jog-hops to the hangar, shouting "WHOO-WHOO-WHOO-WHOO-WHOO!"
[21-Apr-2013 03:02:43]  * TrooperAmemiya slings rifle and follows the squad to the hangar
[21-Apr-2013 03:02:48]  <CharlaGM> The cacophonous cadre of cavalry march-dashes their way to the hangar, like some sort of psychotic pub crawl.
[21-Apr-2013 03:03:42]  <CharlaGM> In the middle are several sizable drop ships capable of carrying multiple squads. On the far wall, a massive holo-television displays a map of part of Seawolf's surface.
[21-Apr-2013 03:04:13]  <CharlaGM> Arrows lead from large green spots to large red spots, then proceed to move on to other green spots.
[21-Apr-2013 03:04:58]  <Cpldrake> "Our pilots are trained right? I remember last mission with interns. Made Ralph uneasy, was bad mission. I blame Alan"
[21-Apr-2013 03:05:35]  <Alan_Walsh> "Hey!"
[21-Apr-2013 03:05:37]  <TrooperBlake> I just want a pilot that doesn't get antsy around me. I don't bite, I tell, them, but they don't believe me.
[21-Apr-2013 03:05:49]  <TrooperBlake> (*I tell them)
[21-Apr-2013 03:06:05]  <CharlaGM> "FUCK YEAH OUR PILOTS ARE TRAINED RIGHT. AND DO YOU SEE THAT WEATHER DOWN THERE? FINEST SHIT IN THIS SECTOR. TONS OF CLOUDS AND NOT AN ANGRY CUMULO-WHATTHEFUCKEVER BETWEEN THEM."
[21-Apr-2013 03:08:23]  <CharlaGM> "FUCKING LUAU ALL UP IN THIS SHIT SOON AS WE SMOKE SOME SHARKS."
[21-Apr-2013 03:08:44]  <Alan_Walsh> "Sounds good t' me."
[21-Apr-2013 03:08:45]  * TrooperBlake loses some of his enthusiasm.
[21-Apr-2013 03:08:47]  <Cpldrake> Alright, everyone made landing preperations, make sure guns are loaded, Alan, make sure you remember which end you point at the enemy
[21-Apr-2013 03:08:50]  <TrooperAmemiya> URAA!
[21-Apr-2013 03:08:59]  <TrooperBlake> Well, let's get this show on the road!
[21-Apr-2013 03:09:22]  * TrooperBlake flicks safety catch on launcher off.
[21-Apr-2013 03:09:52]  <Lin_Chong> yaaaay
[21-Apr-2013 03:10:04]  * TrooperAmemiya partially draws back the charging handle on his rifle, checking to make sure a round is indeed chambered
[21-Apr-2013 03:10:06]  * Alan_Walsh checks flechette gun, safety's still off.
[21-Apr-2013 03:10:09]  <CharlaGM> "EVERYBODY PILE IN! WE LAND AT THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COAST AND MARCH OUR WAY NORTH!"
[21-Apr-2013 03:10:18]  <TrooperBlake> I call shotgun!
[21-Apr-2013 03:10:30]  * Cpldrake turns off cannon safety
[21-Apr-2013 03:10:38]  <Cpldrake> "Wait one sec
[21-Apr-2013 03:10:53]  * Cpldrake goes out on the deck, pointing the cannon at a wall, then fires
[21-Apr-2013 03:11:03]  <Cpldrake> "Need to to safety weapon check. Gun works. Lets go"
[21-Apr-2013 03:11:16]  * Alan_Walsh gives Drake a disturbed look.
[21-Apr-2013 03:11:17]  * TrooperAmemiya ensure bolt is closed, keeps safety on
[21-Apr-2013 03:11:21]  <TrooperBlake> Whoa, ghesus, Drake!
[21-Apr-2013 03:11:35]  <CharlaGM> "FUCK'S SAKE, DRAKE, EVEN I GIVE A SHIT ABOUT TRIGGER DISCIPLINE, DO THAT SHIT AGAIN AND I'M SENDING YOU OUT WITH A PISTOL."
[21-Apr-2013 03:11:36]  * TrooperAmemiya points at Drake
[21-Apr-2013 03:11:45]  <TrooperAmemiya> I'd like to keep as far away from him as possible
[21-Apr-2013 03:11:54]  * TrooperBlake turns safety back on on second thought
[21-Apr-2013 03:12:07]  <Cpldrake> LT, just needed to make sure. Last trip tried to frag officer, but gun didn't work. Got a week without pay
[21-Apr-2013 03:12:19]  <Cpldrake> I lost four cousins that week
[21-Apr-2013 03:12:26]  <TrooperAmemiya> Can we send him out without the dropship?
[21-Apr-2013 03:12:31]  <CharlaGM> LT Fendel just stares daggers at Drake.
[21-Apr-2013 03:12:39]  <Alan_Walsh> "Nah, I think he's funny."
[21-Apr-2013 03:12:54]  * TrooperBlake murmurs "what's going to kill me first, the sharks, or Drake?"
[21-Apr-2013 03:12:57]  * Cpldrake smiles at LT, "I see you know the Volg expression of love between man and woman"
[21-Apr-2013 03:13:11]  <Alan_Walsh> "So, Drake's pointman?"
[21-Apr-2013 03:13:12]  <CharlaGM> "TRUST ME, I'D LOVE TO JUST DROP HIM ON ECHO'S HEADS, BUT WE GOTTA SNIFF THE CARTILIGE-Y BASTARDS OUT FIRST."
[21-Apr-2013 03:13:15]  <Cpldrake> But I am professional soldier, so I focus only on work. And killing. And my gun"
[21-Apr-2013 03:13:26]  <CharlaGM> (I AM HEAVY WEAPONS GUY.)
[21-Apr-2013 03:13:28]  <CharlaGM> (AND THIS)
[21-Apr-2013 03:13:31]  <CharlaGM> (IS MY WEAPON.)
[21-Apr-2013 03:13:37]  <TrooperBlake> On second thought, Drake, you can have shotgun!
[21-Apr-2013 03:13:48]  <CharlaGM> (IT FIRES 80 GIGAWATT PHASED PLASMA BEAMS 2 TIMES A SECOND.)
[21-Apr-2013 03:14:01]  <Cpldrake> (it deals 2d10 damage per bullet)
[21-Apr-2013 03:14:13]  <TrooperBlake> (It costs twenty million credits to fire this weapon for three seconds.)
[21-Apr-2013 03:14:43]  <CharlaGM> "ALRIGHT! EVERYBODY ONBOARD?"
[21-Apr-2013 03:14:45]  <Cpldrake> (cue Drake getting instakilled once we land)
[21-Apr-2013 03:14:51]  <TrooperAmemiya> (batteries are expensive in the future)
[21-Apr-2013 03:15:02]  <Alan_Walsh> "Ah'm still here."
[21-Apr-2013 03:15:12]  <CharlaGM> (I figure the e-cannon has something more like a tiny fusion reactor powering it.)
[21-Apr-2013 03:15:20]  <TrooperBlake> As much as I wish I wasn't, I am.
[21-Apr-2013 03:15:23]  <Cpldrake> (its powered by sheer hatred)
[21-Apr-2013 03:15:32]  <TrooperAmemiya> (or insanity)
[21-Apr-2013 03:15:36]  <Cpldrake> I am ready for a good trip on a beach
[21-Apr-2013 03:15:47]  <Cpldrake> I might even be able to feed Alan to a shark
[21-Apr-2013 03:15:48]  <Alan_Walsh> (Or competition.)
[21-Apr-2013 03:15:53]  <CharlaGM> "ALRIGHT! LOCK DOWN YOUR SHIT, WE DROP IN 1 MINUTE."
[21-Apr-2013 03:15:57]  <Alan_Walsh> (Every unit should be equipped with a Super Scope.)
[21-Apr-2013 03:16:16]  * TrooperBlake buckles up as quickly as possible
[21-Apr-2013 03:16:17]  <Alan_Walsh> "Drake, I'm not gonna give that remark the dignity of a response."
[21-Apr-2013 03:16:28]  * TrooperAmemiya ensures harness is secure
[21-Apr-2013 03:16:35]  <TrooperBlake> Except for that, Alan.
[21-Apr-2013 03:16:46]  <CharlaGM> "10!"
[21-Apr-2013 03:16:48]  <CharlaGM> "9!"
[21-Apr-2013 03:16:48]  <Lin_Chong> I don't know, I might think humor is permanent enough to help Drake.
[21-Apr-2013 03:16:50]  <CharlaGM> "8!"
[21-Apr-2013 03:16:52]  <CharlaGM> "7!"

[21-Apr-2013 04:08:04]  <TrooperAmemiya> (Highes Success)
[21-Apr-2013 04:08:35]  <CharlaGM> (So BGTB, and Lin, you two figure out which range to put everyone at for a start)
[21-Apr-2013 04:09:12]  <TrooperBlake> (But didn't we tie with the aliens?)
[21-Apr-2013 04:09:19]  <TrooperAmemiya> (Successes are ordered from the highest roll to the lowest, so while a low roll gives you success you may need a higher roll to be more successful than your opponent.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:09:51]  <TrooperAmemiya> (Alan rolled a 6; highest success I believe)
[21-Apr-2013 04:10:31]  <Alan_Walsh> (What does this mean?)
[21-Apr-2013 04:10:31]  <CharlaGM> (As for tie between the aliens and you guys)
[21-Apr-2013 04:10:53]  <CharlaGM> +roll 1d10
[21-Apr-2013 04:10:53]  <rollermine> CharlaGM: (9)=9
[21-Apr-2013 04:10:54]  <CharlaGM> (It means you choose whether the team starts at close, medium or far)
[21-Apr-2013 04:11:14]  <CharlaGM> (This is important because of the range stats for your weapons)
[21-Apr-2013 04:12:31]  <Alan_Walsh> (Looks like Near's the best option, let's go with that.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:12:49]  <TrooperBlake> (Well, that's for BGT and Lin to negotiate.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:13:11]  <Cpldrake> Keep 'em close so I can dust 'em
[21-Apr-2013 04:13:29]  <TrooperAmemiya> +roll d10
[21-Apr-2013 04:13:29]  <rollermine> TrooperAmemiya: 6=6
[21-Apr-2013 04:14:28]  <TrooperBlake> (Your roll, Lin.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:14:29]  <CharlaGM> Alright, so you guys definitely get the first shot off
[21-Apr-2013 04:14:34]  <Lin_Chong> +roll d10
[21-Apr-2013 04:14:35]  <rollermine> Lin_Chong: 2=2
[21-Apr-2013 04:15:07]  <TrooperBlake> (Well, Lin gets to pick the range, I'm guessing.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:15:07]  <CharlaGM> (Holy shit, yeah, you definitely go first. Lin chooses range.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:15:37]  <CharlaGM> (Yes.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:16:16]  <Lin_Chong> (how do I do that)
[21-Apr-2013 04:16:35]  <TrooperAmemiya> (I thought JBridge got the highest success)
[21-Apr-2013 04:16:48]  *** Alicia <Mibbit@c-98-199-217-5.hsd1.tx.comcast.net> has joined #madokamadness
[21-Apr-2013 04:17:25]  <TrooperBlake> (@BGT: It works backwards here: the lower the number you roll, the better.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:17:25]  <CharlaGM> (Let's just assume Lin rolled highest for now)
[21-Apr-2013 04:17:53]  <TrooperBlake> (I'm assuming it's like how Armor Class works in D&D or whatever.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:17:54]  <CharlaGM> (Lin: You just pick it.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:17:54]  <CharlaGM> (BGTB: You want to roll under here.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:18:14]  <TrooperBlake> (Lin: Choose Close, Near, or Far.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:19:00]  <CharlaGM> (Lin: The ranges relate to the three different numbers for each weapon on your char sheet)
[21-Apr-2013 04:21:04]  <Lin_Chong> (far then)
[21-Apr-2013 04:21:34]  <TrooperBlake> "If these things could fuck up a dropship..."
[21-Apr-2013 04:21:35]  <CharlaGM> (Alright.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:22:23]  <CharlaGM> Noooow everybody rolls d10
[21-Apr-2013 04:22:34]  <Lin_Chong> +roll
[21-Apr-2013 04:22:34]  <rollermine> Lin_Chong: Peg parsing error at character position 0.
[21-Apr-2013 04:22:37]  <TrooperBlake> +roll d10

[21-Apr-2013 04:22:47]  <TrooperBlake> (Shit.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:22:57]  <Cpldrake> +roll d10
[21-Apr-2013 04:22:57]  <rollermine> Cpldrake: 4=4

[21-Apr-2013 04:23:21]  <Alan_Walsh> (Oh my.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:23:35]  <TrooperBlake> (All of us failed.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:23:37]  <TrooperAmemiya> (Failed both FA and NFA)
[21-Apr-2013 04:23:40]  <Alan_Walsh> (Bollocks.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:23:51]  <Alan_Walsh> +roll d1
[21-Apr-2013 04:23:51]  <rollermine> Alan_Walsh: 1=1
[21-Apr-2013 04:23:52]  <CharlaGM> Now from highest to lowest roll the Far range stats for your weapons.
[21-Apr-2013 04:23:53]  <Alan_Walsh> There.
[21-Apr-2013 04:23:56]  <CharlaGM> (No no, you did good! This is rolling Ambush kills for you guys.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:24:07]  <Alan_Walsh> (Ah.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:24:10]  <TrooperAmemiya> (oh)
[21-Apr-2013 04:24:17]  <CharlaGM> (Also feel free to add flavor text.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:24:17]  <Alan_Walsh> (I got nothin' for Far.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:24:22]  <CharlaGM> (Also also this will go much smoother next time.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:24:32]  <Alan_Walsh> (Probably.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:24:33]  <TrooperBlake> (I got 1 for Far.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:24:36]  <TrooperAmemiya> +roll d6
[21-Apr-2013 04:24:36]  <rollermine> TrooperAmemiya: 4=4
[21-Apr-2013 04:25:14]  * TrooperBlake fires a grenade into the crowd of sharks, said grenade lands down the gullet of one and explodes the shark messily.
[21-Apr-2013 04:25:40]  * TrooperAmemiya flicks the safety off and takes aim, firing short bursts into the sharks below
[21-Apr-2013 04:25:59]  <CharlaGM> (Aaaand when all of you are done add the kills to your kills this planet and total kills)
[21-Apr-2013 04:28:19]  <TrooperAmemiya> (So add our d10 roll and our weapon rolls?)
[21-Apr-2013 04:28:46]  <TrooperBlake> (Lin, you have to roll for Ambush kills.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:29:28]  <Lin_Chong> (which dice)
[21-Apr-2013 04:29:43]  <TrooperBlake> (A d6.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:29:57]  <CharlaGM> (No, no, no, the d10 is to determine order and THEN you roll the weapon rolls to determine kills made)
[21-Apr-2013 04:30:25]  <TrooperBlake> (Oh. Whoops.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:31:04]  <Lin_Chong> +roll d10
[21-Apr-2013 04:31:04]  <rollermine> Lin_Chong: 3=3
[21-Apr-2013 04:31:43]  <Cpldrake> (I got nothing for far)
[21-Apr-2013 04:32:42]  <CharlaGM> Alright.
[21-Apr-2013 04:33:11]  <CharlaGM> (That's about 10 shaaaarks so far.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:33:42]  <CharlaGM> (Who actually made a kill?)
[21-Apr-2013 04:33:54]  <TrooperBlake> (Me and BGT, I think.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:34:25]  <TrooperAmemiya> (I have no idea what's going on anymore :<)
[21-Apr-2013 04:34:37]  <CharlaGM> (Also Lin, and neither do I.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:34:54]  <CharlaGM> (...You know what? I screwed up I think.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:34:54]  <CharlaGM> (Tell you what.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:35:19]  <CharlaGM> (We try again next week and we start from abooooout where people upchucked in the drop ship.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:35:27]  <Alan_Walsh> (Sure.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:35:27]  <CharlaGM> (Because everything kinda came to a crawl.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:35:31]  <TrooperBlake> (Sure.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:35:37]  <TrooperAmemiya> (sounds good)
[21-Apr-2013 04:35:55]  <TrooperBlake> (Should we revert the changes we made to the kill counts?)
[21-Apr-2013 04:36:05]  <CharlaGM> (My apologies, guys. Although I may also need to talk to Lin to see if he'll really be able to participate reliably.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:36:09]  <CharlaGM> (And yes.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:36:21]  <Lin_Chong> I'm just really bad with the rules
[21-Apr-2013 04:36:35]  <CharlaGM> (Ah.)
[21-Apr-2013 04:36:55]  <CharlaGM> (Do you not play RPGs often or is this just plumb confusing?)
