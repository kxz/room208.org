[10-Mar-2012 20:23:21]  <Kyuubey> So, Magical Burst, Episode 1.  
[10-Mar-2012 20:23:23]  <BarcoDoomRL> Well, I'm not playing it /yet.
[10-Mar-2012 20:23:26]  <BarcoDoomRL>  /
[10-Mar-2012 20:23:28]  <BarcoDoomRL> Yeah get on that
[10-Mar-2012 20:24:38]  * Ami watches the opening credits.
[10-Mar-2012 20:24:44]  <Motoko> Okay, I fixed the relationship drawing. ^_^
[10-Mar-2012 20:24:49]  <Kyuubey> Dubai is, by all objective reasoning, the most luxurious city on the planet.  Extravagant architecture, artistically created islands, cocktails made of ingredients so exotic that I forgot where I was going with this.
[10-Mar-2012 20:25:22]  <BarcoDoomRL> [heehee]
[10-Mar-2012 20:25:32]  <Ami> Cocktails made of ingredients so erotic that Jackerel forgot the day.
[10-Mar-2012 20:25:32]  * Kyuubey sips cocktail.
[10-Mar-2012 20:25:37]  <Kyuubey> pffft.
[10-Mar-2012 20:25:56]  * Ami imagines spit take.
[10-Mar-2012 20:26:39]  <Kyuubey> Anyways, as far as the timeline goes, has everyone made their contract, or is that what the first episode is going to resolve?
[10-Mar-2012 20:27:16]  <Motoko> Mine's been signed, notarized, and filed away in the endless magical girl bureaucracy.
[10-Mar-2012 20:27:28]  <Naima> Motoko and I have been active for a while now.  Ami?
[10-Mar-2012 20:27:51]  <Ami> Recently made the contract, but hasn't been very active.
[10-Mar-2012 20:28:36]  <Kyuubey> I believe that Alk's character has also made the contract recently, but hasn't seen any action yhet.
[10-Mar-2012 20:28:57]  <Motoko> 14I suppose it would make some sense for Naima to start out with fewer relationships than usual, though it does put her at a very strong disadvantage...
[10-Mar-2012 20:29:39]  <Naima> 1Gee.
[10-Mar-2012 20:30:11]  <Motoko> 14It's not my fault you didn't finish the chart!
[10-Mar-2012 20:30:33]  <Kyuubey> The chart is kind of hard to parse, really.  With the cloud of secret hobo cabals and nurses and all that.
[10-Mar-2012 20:30:46]  <Motoko> Just use the character sheet.
[10-Mar-2012 20:31:10]  <Motoko> The chart is only really useful in the initial relationship construction phase, if I'm reading the manual properly.
[10-Mar-2012 20:31:20]  *** Alicia <Mibbit@c-98-199-217-5.hsd1.tx.comcast.net> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Mar-2012 20:32:01]  <Kyuubey> Alright, so, paint the initial scenes for your characters, I guess.
[10-Mar-2012 20:32:15]  <Alicia> Who's Coobie?
[10-Mar-2012 20:32:24]  <Motoko> 14Who goes first?
[10-Mar-2012 20:32:24]  <Kyuubey> Solstace
[10-Mar-2012 20:32:29]  <Alicia> @trace Kyuubey
[10-Mar-2012 20:32:29]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Kyuubey changed to that nick 40 minutes ago, was first seen with the nick Solstace 2 hours ago, and has additionally used the nick Mizuchin (changed to 52 minutes ago).
[10-Mar-2012 20:32:36]  <Naima> 1Alphabetical order.
[10-Mar-2012 20:32:48]  * Motoko 14looks expectantly at Ami
[10-Mar-2012 20:32:54]  <Ami> Not me.
[10-Mar-2012 20:33:23]  <Motoko> 14Okay, reverse alphabetical order, then.
[10-Mar-2012 20:33:43]  * Motoko 14turns eyes from Ami to Naima
[10-Mar-2012 20:33:58]  <Kyuubey> feepbot agrees.
[10-Mar-2012 20:34:08]  <Naima> 1Fine.
[10-Mar-2012 20:34:28]  <Alicia> I see.
[10-Mar-2012 20:34:42]  <Motoko> 14There's an RP going on right now, Alicia.
[10-Mar-2012 20:35:01]  <Naima> 1What's the name of Motoko's school?
[10-Mar-2012 20:35:20]  <Motoko> 14Dubai Phone Microwave High School (name subject to change)
[10-Mar-2012 20:35:33]  <Kyuubey> ......
[10-Mar-2012 20:35:41]  *** Motoko was kicked by Kyuubey (That made me laugh)
[10-Mar-2012 20:35:47]  *** Motoko <~iwatani@eggshell.vo3.net> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Mar-2012 20:35:47]  *** EsperBot sets mode: +o Motoko
[10-Mar-2012 20:36:06]  <Kyuubey> Glad to see I'm not the only taking this less than seriously.
[10-Mar-2012 20:36:46]  <Motoko> The seriousness will slowly set in, like a creeping thunderstorm.
[10-Mar-2012 20:37:09]  * Naima stops in front of Dubai Metasyntactic Identifier High.  It's midway through a school day, and so the building is busy inside but empty on the outside.
[10-Mar-2012 20:38:04]  * Naima flips through a notebook.  Apparently not finding anything of interest, she puts it back in her backpack, and stands and looks at the school for a while, seeing if she can recognize anything in the windows...
[10-Mar-2012 20:39:11]  <Naima> 1Well?  Anyone?
[10-Mar-2012 20:39:27]  <Kyuubey> (didn't realize you were done >.>)
[10-Mar-2012 20:39:49]  <Kyuubey> Motoko: You in class right now?
[10-Mar-2012 20:40:01]  * Motoko stares out the window, as per usual protocol
[10-Mar-2012 20:41:19]  * Motoko isn't really processing the lecture, instead following some birds around the cityscape
[10-Mar-2012 20:42:15]  * Motoko looks back at her notebook, where her hand has been making circles with the pencil for some time now
[10-Mar-2012 20:42:49]  * Motoko turns her gaze outside again, noticing Naima at the steps of the school
[10-Mar-2012 20:43:13]  <Motoko> Wait, it's... that girl from...
[10-Mar-2012 20:43:40]  <Motoko> 14Smash cut to opening credits!
[10-Mar-2012 20:44:32]  <Kyuubey> (hmmmm, maybe I should give at least /some/ context to these sessions....)
[10-Mar-2012 20:44:44]  <Motoko> 14You /are/ the one running them. ;)
[10-Mar-2012 20:45:18]  <Ami> 14That would be useful.
[10-Mar-2012 20:46:15]  <Kyuubey> So, the local news has been buzzing about an ambitious skyscraping hotel being built.  When completed, it will be the new tallest building in the world (hence the buzz).
[10-Mar-2012 20:46:29]  <Kyuubey> (note to self:  just stick with DnD after this >.>  It's what you're good at )
[10-Mar-2012 20:48:34]  <Motoko> *watching news, 14not questioning you, Solstace, just so you know* Another one? Isn't the tallest building in the world already here?
[10-Mar-2012 20:50:23]  <Kyuubey> Motoko: This one new project should be towering over the previous one by about a 1200 feet, an engineering feat that many are skeptical about.
[10-Mar-2012 20:50:42]  <Naima> 1Perhaps Kyuubey could play one of motoko's classmates.
[10-Mar-2012 20:51:17]  <Motoko> 14Wow. That's almost half again as tall as the Burj Khalifa.
[10-Mar-2012 20:51:50]  <Kyuubey> (asldjgahd;lfka  frustration already setting in >.>)
[10-Mar-2012 20:52:40]  <Motoko> Hm, it almost looks like some kind of... beacon.
[10-Mar-2012 20:53:15]  <Kyuubey> Motoko: You recognize the shape of the concept drawings as something from one of your dreams.
[10-Mar-2012 20:53:58]  <Motoko> Wait a second...
[10-Mar-2012 20:54:16]  * Naima moves on, idly wondering why a building has so many children in it.  Training facility?
[10-Mar-2012 20:54:44]  * Motoko runs to room and goes shuffling through a pile of papers, finally finding an old sketchbook
[10-Mar-2012 20:55:01]  <Naima> 1wait, I thought you were at school?  or did we skip
[10-Mar-2012 20:55:06]  * Ami 1has seen the news repeating endlessly on the televisions in the hospital's waiting areas. She's honestly a bit tired of it, but changing the channel doesn't stick when people can't remember you asking to change it.
[10-Mar-2012 20:55:18]  <Naima> 1not ooc!
[10-Mar-2012 20:55:26]  * Motoko flips to a seemingly arbitrary page and holds it up next to the television
[10-Mar-2012 20:55:51]  <Kyuubey> Naima: I think we skipped after Motoko did the cut to the intro earlier. 
[10-Mar-2012 20:55:55]  <Kyuubey> >.>
[10-Mar-2012 20:56:04]  <Naima> 1right.
[10-Mar-2012 20:56:38]  <Motoko> They look almost the same...
[10-Mar-2012 20:56:56]  <Motoko> *yells* Hey, Mizu-chin!
[10-Mar-2012 20:57:14]  <Naima> 1you're yelling at something you only see in dreams?
[10-Mar-2012 20:57:31]  <Motoko> 14Oh, was that it? I can't just summon him whenever?
[10-Mar-2012 20:57:44]  <Kyuubey> ( I don't remember, myself, really.)
[10-Mar-2012 20:57:52]  <Kyuubey> (Oh, what the hell....)
[10-Mar-2012 20:57:54]  <Naima> 1Roll with it, you're hallucinating.  Mizu-chin, appear!
[10-Mar-2012 20:58:42]  <Kyuubey> The dolphin looking creature gallivants (assuming his species is capable of gallivanting..)  out of your closet, what he was doing in there, you will never know.
[10-Mar-2012 20:59:13]  <Motoko> 14We all know he's a pervert.
[10-Mar-2012 20:59:43]  <Ami> 14Dolphins are notorious perverts.
[10-Mar-2012 21:00:13]  <Kyuubey> Mizu-chin: What is it, Motoko~?
[10-Mar-2012 21:00:15]  * Motoko nearly tosses the notebook at Mizu-chin, but thinks better of doing so
[10-Mar-2012 21:00:30]  <Motoko> What's with this building?
[10-Mar-2012 21:00:53]  <Motoko> You know about my dreams. I mean, you only show up in them about sixty percent of the time.
[10-Mar-2012 21:01:27]  <Motoko> I'm sure this isn't a coincidence. Especially given that you're involved.
[10-Mar-2012 21:01:32]  <Naima> 1gaaaaah gotta do something else for a bit, sorry
[10-Mar-2012 21:02:17]  <Ami> 14Kyuubey: Has the construction started on the building and such?
[10-Mar-2012 21:02:26]  <Kyuubey> Mizu-chin:  Just because I show up in your dreams, doesn't mean I know everything about them!  Silly human~!
[10-Mar-2012 21:02:57]  <Kyuubey> Ami: Yes. And it's making progress quite rapidly.  
[10-Mar-2012 21:03:07]  * Motoko picks up Mizu-chin like a stuffed animal and stares him down
[10-Mar-2012 21:03:47]  <Ami> 14I'd assume Ami can see the building site, or some of it, from her hospital, if that's all right.
[10-Mar-2012 21:03:53]  <Kyuubey> Yes.
[10-Mar-2012 21:04:11]  <Kyuubey> The construction is visible in some way from where all of you are located.
[10-Mar-2012 21:04:41]  <Kyuubey> Ami: Also, didn't mean to neglect, but I just figured out a way to hook your situation.
[10-Mar-2012 21:05:06]  <Ami> 14That's fine.
[10-Mar-2012 21:05:32]  <Motoko> Mizu-chin, I know evasiveness is built into whatever your species' equivalent of DNA is, but things like this don't just happen. Now out with it.
[10-Mar-2012 21:05:41]  *** Alicia <Mibbit@c-98-199-217-5.hsd1.tx.comcast.net> has left #madokamadness
[10-Mar-2012 21:06:59]  <Motoko> 14Unrelatedly, I'd really love to be able to tab-complete "Mizu-chin"...
[10-Mar-2012 21:07:28]  <Kyuubey> While visiting Essa, as per routine, he starts talking about how he his uncle is overseeing construction.  He and his uncle are quite close, and you've seen them visit quite often.
[10-Mar-2012 21:07:44]  <Kyuubey> Motoko: Your wish is my command!  (That'll cost you one contract, by the way ^_^)
[10-Mar-2012 21:07:47]  *** Kyuubey is now known as Mizu-chin
[10-Mar-2012 21:08:27]  <Motoko> 14The nick change, or the information?
[10-Mar-2012 21:09:04]  <Mizu-chin> Motoko: "Hey, you're the one insisting that one of your dream people is real.  I'm not going to argue with a crazy lady~.  But go take a look, if you think you can~!"
[10-Mar-2012 21:09:12]  * Mizu-chin pops back into his unexistence.
[10-Mar-2012 21:09:36]  <Mizu-chin> Motoko: The way Mizu-chin lingered on "can" gives you a funny feeling.
[10-Mar-2012 21:09:38]  <Motoko> 14Wow, a relationship built on mutual sarcasm. This is going to be fun.
[10-Mar-2012 21:10:15]  * Motoko sighs
[10-Mar-2012 21:10:20]  <Motoko> I wasn't finished!
[10-Mar-2012 21:10:28]  <Ami> Do you know what the building is for, Essa?
[10-Mar-2012 21:11:15]  * Motoko reaches at where Mizu-chin had previously been standing, as if to pull him back out of thin air
[10-Mar-2012 21:11:55]  <Mizu-chin> Essa:  "It's supposed to be some hotel, I think.  Like every other building here."
[10-Mar-2012 21:12:11]  <Motoko> 14Hey, now, some of them have offices.
[10-Mar-2012 21:12:27]  <Mizu-chin> Motoko:  Well, you were holding him when he disappeared......
[10-Mar-2012 21:12:40]  <Mizu-chin> (I guess that means that Mizu-chin's special ability is teleport >.>)
[10-Mar-2012 21:12:59]  *** BarcoDoomRL is now known as Barcodrawing
[10-Mar-2012 21:13:01]  <Mizu-chin> (and I think that I'm done GMing Motoko for now)
[10-Mar-2012 21:13:28]  <Motoko> 14Do continue. I was going to ask about Naima's appearance, but we can hold that for later.
[10-Mar-2012 21:13:30]  * Ami nods distractedly. Another hotel made sense. Dubai's major imports were cranes and rich tourists. Still the building was weird.
[10-Mar-2012 21:13:51]  <Ami> It's going up pretty quickly. I'm sure your uncle is happy about that.
[10-Mar-2012 21:14:51]  <Mizu-chin> Essa: "I guess.  I wouldn't know.  He hasn't come to visit since construction started."  (insert sadface here)
[10-Mar-2012 21:15:58]  <Mizu-chin> (I think I'm getting the hang of GMing this..  Sort of.)
[10-Mar-2012 21:16:52]  <Mizu-chin> (also, I don't have know how long ago construction started.  Assume that it was long enough ago to inconvenience those related to it, but it's recent enough to still be newsworthy.)
[10-Mar-2012 21:18:15]  <Ami> I'm sorry. Any idea when you're going to be getting out of here?
[10-Mar-2012 21:18:47]  * Ami was aware that Essa was in remission, but the doctors had been reluctant to release him.
[10-Mar-2012 21:19:46]  <Mizu-chin> Essa:  "I'm not sure.  The doctors keep telling me 'soon', and otherwise avoid the question."
[10-Mar-2012 21:20:16]  <Mizu-chin> Oh.
[10-Mar-2012 21:20:18]  *** Jack|ProbablyAsleep <~LANDSHARK@75-51-144-130.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Mar-2012 21:20:52]  <Motoko> 14Oh, there he is.
[10-Mar-2012 21:20:56]  <Mizu-chin> (oh, huh, Ami, when wishing yourself out of existence, that also cured you of your disease, right.)
[10-Mar-2012 21:20:58]  * Jack|ProbablyAsleep facepalms
[10-Mar-2012 21:21:02]  *** Jack|ProbablyAsleep is now known as Sato
[10-Mar-2012 21:21:08]  <Ami> I hope it is soon, Essa. I'll come by again.
[10-Mar-2012 21:21:57]  <Ami> 14Yeah, cured. Still have the habits of a sick person because of that word for things that your brain causes to your body. I'll remember it shortly.
[10-Mar-2012 21:22:45]  <Mizu-chin> Sato: Okay, quick recap:  Local news has been going on about construction on a new skyscraper that's supposed to tower over the previous tallest building in the world by about 1200 feet.  Motoko saw the building in a dream, currently setting the stage for ami.
[10-Mar-2012 21:23:09]  <Sato> (Alright!)
[10-Mar-2012 21:23:12]  * Ami heads to the roof to check out the tower that's been rising from the ground nearby recently.
[10-Mar-2012 21:24:43]  <Ami> 14My stage setting is kind of awful because "Haha, I've only really played DnD." So, sorry.
[10-Mar-2012 21:25:47]  <Mizu-chin> Ami: Okay, before you left, Essa said something about not being able to phone his uncle, and asked if you could go down to the construction site and remind him of his familiar duties.  (lol slow typing)
[10-Mar-2012 21:25:55]  <Sato> (The building's the Burj Khalifa, or something else?)
[10-Mar-2012 21:26:01]  <Mizu-chin> *familial
[10-Mar-2012 21:26:27]  <Mizu-chin> Sato: The current "tallest building" is the Burj Khalifa.  This new one is going to tower over the Burj Khalifa by 1200 feet, approx.
[10-Mar-2012 21:26:42]  <Sato> (Yeah, was thinking that. Thanks.)
[10-Mar-2012 21:26:43]  <Ami> Mizu-chin: Oh, right. Assume Ami agreed and wished him well and all that stuff friends do.
[10-Mar-2012 21:26:51]  <Mizu-chin> Done!
[10-Mar-2012 21:27:12]  <Mizu-chin> (okay, that makes 2 peeps down, as far as investigation motivation goes... 2 more to go...)
[10-Mar-2012 21:28:07]  <Ami> 14The Burj Khalifa is a very pretty building.
[10-Mar-2012 21:28:10]  <Mizu-chin> Sato: Set a basic scene for your character.  What you're doing, where, who etc.
[10-Mar-2012 21:28:17]  <Sato> Okay.
[10-Mar-2012 21:28:37]  * Sato is busy waiting in the Japanese Embassy. Like he usually does. Trying to call his dad.
[10-Mar-2012 21:29:07]  <Barcodrawing> [jackmack's character's a guy, huh?]
[10-Mar-2012 21:29:14]  <Barcodrawing> [sorry. play on]
[10-Mar-2012 21:29:35]  <Ami> 14Barcodrawing: Well, we couldn't all have UST for the dolphin abomination.
[10-Mar-2012 21:29:44]  <Barcodrawing> [Good, good.]
[10-Mar-2012 21:29:47]  <Sato> (Pfft.)
[10-Mar-2012 21:29:50]  <Barcodrawing> [Actually. No comment]
[10-Mar-2012 21:29:55]  * Sato slaps Barcodrawing.
[10-Mar-2012 21:30:17]  <Barcodrawing> [I just odn't know how to put into words that I'd like to avoid commenting at all! ow]
[10-Mar-2012 21:32:00]  <Mizu-chin> Sato: Getting your father on the phone isn't terribly hard.   In fact, it's quite easy >.>
[10-Mar-2012 21:32:17]  <Sato> Not when you're trying to deal with dumb call centers and cheap cellphone minutes!!
[10-Mar-2012 21:32:27]  * Sato thinks of that scene in Transformers.
[10-Mar-2012 21:32:35]  <Mizu-chin> (also, problem:  Wishes are granted when making the contract, so, ummm, yeah.)
[10-Mar-2012 21:32:53]  <Ami> 14LEFT CHEEK, LEFT CHEEK!
[10-Mar-2012 21:33:10]  * Ami 14is flashing back to awful movies.
[10-Mar-2012 21:33:43]  <Barcodrawing> [Didn't you say  you were starting the campaign with wishes/contracts made beforehand?]
[10-Mar-2012 21:33:49]  <Mizu-chin> Yes.
[10-Mar-2012 21:34:00]  <Barcodrawing> [also maybe quarterback just has some trouble erasing existences immediately]
[10-Mar-2012 21:34:08]  <Mizu-chin> The problem is that his wish was for a billion yen, or for his character to get back home.
[10-Mar-2012 21:34:16]  <Sato> (Oh. >.>)
[10-Mar-2012 21:34:20]  <Mizu-chin> So if that wish has already been granted, why the fuck is he still in Dubai?
[10-Mar-2012 21:34:21]  <Mizu-chin> >.>
[10-Mar-2012 21:34:27]  <Mizu-chin> (I should have caught this earlier)
[10-Mar-2012 21:34:30]  <Sato> (>:C)
[10-Mar-2012 21:34:35]  * Sato anthyslap
[10-Mar-2012 21:34:45]  <Ami> 14He's still in Dubai because of poor GMing.
[10-Mar-2012 21:35:33]  <Motoko> 14He got a billion yen, obviously.

[10-Mar-2012 21:36:15]  <Ami> 14Well, some people would exchange yen with a teen if you know what I mean.
[10-Mar-2012 21:36:20]  <Mizu-chin> Let's say that the contracts involve a clause about staying in the general Dubai vicinity, lest you be waking out on your contract.

[10-Mar-2012 21:48:47]  <Sato> The embassy could be near it. Don't know if Embassies allow people staying there, I highly doubt it.
[10-Mar-2012 21:49:09]  <Mizu-chin> Sato: You've heard about how quickly the construction is progressing, and quite frankly, it seems unreal.
[10-Mar-2012 21:49:11]  <Ami> 14Embassies generally allow asylum,, I think.
[10-Mar-2012 21:49:26]  <Sato> (Yeah, Sato's taking advantage of that.)
[10-Mar-2012 21:49:52]  <Motoko> 14Well, the Burj Khalifa only cost $1.5 billion to build. If we extrapolate the number for a larger building to about $2.5 billion, he'd be responsible for about 0.5% all by himself...
[10-Mar-2012 21:50:18]  <Mizu-chin> I don't believe that's what's happening, so can we stop speculating on it, unless Sato says otherwise?
[10-Mar-2012 21:50:31]  <Sato> "Oh... dad, you hear about that huge building they're building here? Yeah, I know, it's wasteful..."

[10-Mar-2012 22:02:40]  <Barcodrawing> And well. I'm working in an architectural firm at the moment. Being not trained as a structural engineer, though, it feels like they're having a hard time giving me relevant work.
