[31-Jan-2013 02:18:00]  <IllFlower> and off we go.
[31-Jan-2013 02:18:30]  <IllFlower> Miaka finds herself sitting at a desk in an empty classroom, staring out of the windows, curtains blowing in the breeze.
[31-Jan-2013 02:18:44]  <Fiora> ((I thought that the sessions were noly for 3 people or something?))
[31-Jan-2013 02:18:50]  <Fiora> ((I'm slightly confused, did you mean you wanted my dialogue to carry it?))
[31-Jan-2013 02:18:59]  <IllFlower> it looks like it's early spring; not quite cherry blossom season, but still a nice day nonetheless.
[31-Jan-2013 02:19:01]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((the last like, three have had no player limit; be sure to check the header under the actual time!))
[31-Jan-2013 02:19:33]  <IllFlower> Fiora: the episode's not dependent on you; on the flip side, it's not structured in such a way that adding another player will have too big an impact.
[31-Jan-2013 02:19:38]  <Fiora> ah, okay
[31-Jan-2013 02:19:59]  <Fiora> ((I'll stay out then, don't want to hold up things))
[31-Jan-2013 02:20:15]  <IllFlower> (unrelatedly, this song sounds like Trent Reznor trying to do Beck.)
[31-Jan-2013 02:20:26]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((side note, mister flower, you should make sure to bold when the sessions have no player limit. also what, the flatline thing?))
[31-Jan-2013 02:20:34]  <IllFlower> Fiora: you wouldn't be, but it's up to you.
[31-Jan-2013 02:20:58]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: it's not about player limits. this is me just going "yeah, I don't care" at the last minute :p
[31-Jan-2013 02:21:06]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((heh. aight.))
[31-Jan-2013 02:21:40]  <IllFlower> "how are you feeling?" a female voice asks from somewhere behind Miaka.
[31-Jan-2013 02:23:03]  <Fiora> ((I meant, because I'm still at work ^^;;)
[31-Jan-2013 02:23:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((somethin' else coming, I presume...waitin'))
[31-Jan-2013 02:23:37]  <IllFlower> Miaka turns around to see a shifting silhouette, one that looks vaguely like another girl about her age. she's fairly tall, with hair about back-length, but any other distinguishing features are lost in her murky figure. **
[31-Jan-2013 02:24:06]  *** Saladofstones is now known as saladside2
[31-Jan-2013 02:24:13]  <Aoi> 14hi
[31-Jan-2013 02:24:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((assuming to take it in stride))
[31-Jan-2013 02:24:38]  <IllFlower> Aoi: that was fast.
[31-Jan-2013 02:25:00]  <Aoi> 14anything for the team, boss
[31-Jan-2013 02:26:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "Iunno, my whole body feels...weird." Miaka scratches absently at the back of her head. "Head's fuzzy. Feel like if I were to get up and run right now I'd fall down three steps in, at any rate..."
[31-Jan-2013 02:26:15]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "Sure is nice out, though...got no reason to move."
[31-Jan-2013 02:27:34]  <IllFlower> the silhouette takes a seat at the desk in front of Miaka. "and it doesn't look like this weather is going anywhere, so you don't have to rush." she giggles.
[31-Jan-2013 02:28:19]  <IllFlower> reaching back with her right arm, she brushes her hair back a bit, letting the low wind catch it.
[31-Jan-2013 02:28:47]  <Fiora> (Homura?)
[31-Jan-2013 02:29:00]  <IllFlower> "hey," she says, seeming to suddenly change the subject, "I wanted to ask you..." **
[31-Jan-2013 02:29:13]  <Aoi> 14canyousee
[31-Jan-2013 02:30:11]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> Watanabe had followed the silhouette as it went to the desk in front of her, but continued turning her head to look outside. She felt so drowsy. "Ask me what?"
[31-Jan-2013 02:30:54]  <IllFlower> "oh, uh... nothing, really. it's just that... I've been feeling kind of strange lately..." **
[31-Jan-2013 02:32:25]  <IllFlower> Fiora: "I whip my hair back and forth, I whip my hair back and forth, I whip my hair back and forth"
[31-Jan-2013 02:32:54]  *** Doc_Kraken <Mibbit@203.116.187.1> has joined #madokamadness
[31-Jan-2013 02:32:57]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "You too, huh." Miaka slowly straightens out a little, trying to pick out activity outside.
[31-Jan-2013 02:33:17]  <IllFlower> "it's a little different..."
[31-Jan-2013 02:33:37]  <Aoi> 14HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ARE YOU A FISH
[31-Jan-2013 02:33:49]  <IllFlower> the figure reaches out and grabs Miaka's hand from the desk.
[31-Jan-2013 02:34:20]  <IllFlower> "it hurts a little bit right here..."
[31-Jan-2013 02:35:18]  <IllFlower> she takes Miaka's hand and places it on her shadowy chest. Miaka looks up in some confusion. a moment of silence passes.
[31-Jan-2013 02:35:37]  <IllFlower> "right here," she says, pressing it further in, as it bursts into flames.
[31-Jan-2013 02:35:49]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((welp))
[31-Jan-2013 02:36:41]  <IllFlower> Miaka's eyes grow wide, as the silhouette pulls her further and further in.
[31-Jan-2013 02:37:10]  <IllFlower> her entire field of vision turns red and orange, and the last thing Miaka hears is a whisper:
[31-Jan-2013 02:37:17]  <IllFlower> "you came too close --"
[31-Jan-2013 02:38:29]  <IllFlower> at that, Miaka positively bolts out of her bed.
[31-Jan-2013 02:38:42]  <Makoto> ((dohohoho))
[31-Jan-2013 02:39:28]  <IllFlower> she looks around. it seems to be mid-afternoon in the hospital. the room is largely empty, with the exception of a single IV drip and the usual monitoring machine whiling away in the corner.
[31-Jan-2013 02:40:18]  <IllFlower> there's a light rap at the door. Miaka can't tell who it is behind the sliding panels, but she can hazard a guess. **
[31-Jan-2013 02:40:40]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> (("Akira Maeda?"))
[31-Jan-2013 02:41:06]  <IllFlower> well, she *is* in a hospital.
[31-Jan-2013 02:41:09]  <Aoi> 14those giant evil dolls from Akira.
[31-Jan-2013 02:41:39]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((oh. oooh))
[31-Jan-2013 02:41:55]  <IllFlower> -_-
[31-Jan-2013 02:42:04]  <IllFlower> a normal hospital.
[31-Jan-2013 02:42:09]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((hold on :P))
[31-Jan-2013 02:42:35]  <Aoi> 14that was a normal hospital!  it's just that tetsuo was a fucking crazy godling.
[31-Jan-2013 02:42:42]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> Miaka raises her arms to rub at her eyes, stops halfway when she feels the pull of the IV. She lowers that arm but goes to work with the other. "...Mom?" she hazards.
[31-Jan-2013 02:42:44]  <Makoto> ((it was....................................DUMBLEDORE))
[31-Jan-2013 02:42:53]  <Makoto> ((or not))
[31-Jan-2013 02:44:17]  <IllFlower> a nurse gently slides open the door, revealing Miaka's mother standing next to her. "good guess," the nurse says. Miaka's mother just smiles.
[31-Jan-2013 02:45:37]  <IllFlower> both of them walk over to Miaka's bedside. the nurse -- her name tag reads "Arimiya" -- takes the usual glance at the medical equipment, writing some notes on a clipboard.
[31-Jan-2013 02:46:10]  <IllFlower> she's in and out fairly quickly, giving a short bow as she leaves.
[31-Jan-2013 02:47:43]  <IllFlower> Miaka's mother sits down, pulling a small box of snacks from her purse and handing them to her daughter. "here, Miaka. they're the chocolate ones," she says gently. **
[31-Jan-2013 02:50:04]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] smiles meekly, eyes going glossy. "Oh, Mom. I'm so glad you're here." She gently picks up one of the chocolates. "...Did they say I can have these...?"
[31-Jan-2013 02:51:06]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> She starts unwrapping one gently regardless.
[31-Jan-2013 02:51:10]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> slowly regardless*
[31-Jan-2013 02:51:35]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((side note, computer fixin's going on, so I may slip in and out. I should be able to get in here and type in RPings in the meantime but in case it's taking me a while))
[31-Jan-2013 02:51:37]  <IllFlower> "since when did I need their permission to get you anything?" she laughs. "of course you can have one.
[31-Jan-2013 02:52:55]  <IllFlower> "I can't believe the doctor when he says you might need to be here for a few weeks, honestly. all those other girls are out already, and you look perfectly fine to me." **
[31-Jan-2013 02:54:44]  *** saladside2 is now known as saladofdota
[31-Jan-2013 02:55:35]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] frowns a little as she finally gets the chocolate free. "At least they're okay." A sudden thought makes her somewhat distressed. "Wait. What am I going to do about school?"
[31-Jan-2013 02:55:50]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> (("take home assignments", yeah yeah, but >in hospital))
[31-Jan-2013 02:56:15]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((just woke up in hospital*))
[31-Jan-2013 02:56:44]  <IllFlower> implication is that she's been there for a couple of days already, in case that wasn't clear.
[31-Jan-2013 02:57:26]  <IllFlower> I imagine her mother would be rather less composed otherwise, haha
[31-Jan-2013 02:58:30]  <IllFlower> "I've been talking with your teachers about that," Miaka's mother says. "I wouldn't worry too much about that. it's not your fault you're in the hospital."
[31-Jan-2013 02:58:53]  <IllFlower> she starts opening her mouth again to speak, but notices something out of the corner of her eye, and stops short.
[31-Jan-2013 02:59:21]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((^^^^ah, right.))
[31-Jan-2013 02:59:22]  <IllFlower> Aoi is standing in the open doorway, holding a vase full of flowers.
[31-Jan-2013 03:00:28]  <IllFlower> another girl that Miaka doesn't recognize (that's Makoto) is standing off to one side, peeking in from Aoi's left. Aoi, for his part, is wearing an expression that says "I don't know what's going on, either."
[31-Jan-2013 03:00:36]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((side note, wrt parentnames, if you ever have to pick them go ahead, I have no preference))
[31-Jan-2013 03:01:50]  <Makoto> IllFlower: ((okay wait what's going on? how long have i known Aoi? how much do i know about what's currently happening, or what happened in the previous arc? context, halp))
[31-Jan-2013 03:01:56]  <IllFlower> Miaka's mother smiles. "looks like you've got someone more important than me to talk to. I need to be home for dinner soon, and you know how your sister is when it comes to all that." (watch me invent family members out of nowhere!)
[31-Jan-2013 03:02:27]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((dare you stretch my Heart from parents to whole family???))
[31-Jan-2013 03:02:35]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((Heart Relationship*))
[31-Jan-2013 03:02:36]  <IllFlower> she stands up, gives Miaka a kiss on the cheek, and heads out. she gives Aoi a playful elbow in the ribs on the way. **
[31-Jan-2013 03:02:43]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((lol.))
[31-Jan-2013 03:03:42]  <IllFlower> Aoi has no idea who this girl is -- Pyunpyun just dumped her on him as he was taking a visit, then a harried nurse handed him this vase and told him to bring it to this room...
[31-Jan-2013 03:03:46]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] smiles more earnestly after the kiss, and watches her mother leave. She finally puts the chocolate in her mouth and looks at the two kids in the doorway.
[31-Jan-2013 03:04:13]  <Aoi> 14what's miaka look like here, i mean, is she a burning flesh golem or what
[31-Jan-2013 03:04:19]  <Makoto> IllFlower: ((Do I know that they are magical gi- er, girl and boy, or not))
[31-Jan-2013 03:04:23]  <Makoto> ((?))
[31-Jan-2013 03:04:31]  <Aoi> 14wait is makoto here
[31-Jan-2013 03:04:32]  <IllFlower> all Pyunpyun bothered to explain was something about "she's a fellow initiate, show her the ropes if you could."
[31-Jan-2013 03:04:35]  <Aoi> 14what is happening
[31-Jan-2013 03:04:49]  <IllFlower> Makoto's the girl standing next to Aoi...
[31-Jan-2013 03:04:52]  <Makoto> ((oh okay I do. yay))
[31-Jan-2013 03:04:57]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((aoi has been told by pyun to show makoto around. makoto's here with aoi to visit miaka. there ya go))
[31-Jan-2013 03:05:03]  <Aoi> 14oh i missed that
[31-Jan-2013 03:05:10]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((also you have flowers in your hands))
[31-Jan-2013 03:05:54]  <Aoi> "Ah, hi, MIaka.... we were just... burning to see... no, that's terrible."
[31-Jan-2013 03:06:01]  * Aoi tries to clear an edge table for the vase
[31-Jan-2013 03:06:36]  <IllFlower> Aoi: for what it's worth, Miaka looks pretty normal, other than the subtle shadow movement, which is pretty unnoticeable if you're not looking for it.
[31-Jan-2013 03:06:46]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] frowns slightly. "Really?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:07:07]  <Aoi> 14noted.
[31-Jan-2013 03:07:22]  * Makoto has been busy bothering Aoi with a series of unimportant questions only tangentially related to the situation at hand. When she spot Miaka she instantly shifts gears.
[31-Jan-2013 03:07:28]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> She does notice the vase, though. "...But uh...thank you for those."
[31-Jan-2013 03:07:55]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: way ahead of you on the name-inventing.
[31-Jan-2013 03:08:01]  <Makoto> @Miaka: Hi how are you my name's Makoto what's you name how long have you been an initiate what's you favorite color do you think anglerfish ever get lonely...?
[31-Jan-2013 03:08:03]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((heh. good, good.))
[31-Jan-2013 03:08:12]  <Aoi> "I'm not really the mourning type... nothing bad enough to happen has happened to me, really.  I mean, until now."
[31-Jan-2013 03:08:32]  <Aoi> "So I have to express myself with these little tokens, righ- Um, Makoto, it's okay to breathe."
[31-Jan-2013 03:09:09]  * Makoto sits down and takes a few deep breaths, twiddling her fingers a little
[31-Jan-2013 03:09:36]  <Aoi> "This is Makoto.  She's new.  I guess, Pyunpyun just kind of, you know how he is."
[31-Jan-2013 03:09:37]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] looks at Makoto, instantaneously getting slightly nervous. "H-hold on..." She tries her best to shoot a very powerful "who the hell is this?" glance at Aoi. ((also illflower what grounds has pyun given for us to keep magical girling secret)
[31-Jan-2013 03:09:37]  <Makoto> "S-sorry, it's just... you guys are actually the first other magical girls I've met since I made my contract and..."
[31-Jan-2013 03:09:46]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((imagine my message before aoi spoke))
[31-Jan-2013 03:10:20]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: well, not many secrets to keep now that you know she is one ;)
[31-Jan-2013 03:10:22]  <Makoto> "Er well. Magical girl and magical boy? Heh heh heh..."
[31-Jan-2013 03:10:51]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] leans back, lolling the chocolate around. It's mostly done at this point. "Well, if you were expecting fast answers....you probably shouldn't ask someone in a hospital bed." She closes her eyes for a moment, looking like she's thinking hard.
[31-Jan-2013 03:11:03]  * Makoto seems to suddenly realize where she is
[31-Jan-2013 03:11:17]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@108-91-87-34.lightspeed.cicril.sbcglobal.net> has joined #madokamadness
[31-Jan-2013 03:11:18]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: harsh, man. :p
[31-Jan-2013 03:11:29]  <Makoto> "...w-wait. What happened? Are you okay? Did a witch do it?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:11:29]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((gotta try to remember my social is 3 at /some/ point))
[31-Jan-2013 03:11:47]  * Aoi briefly glares at Makoto for the "girls" thing
[31-Jan-2013 03:11:57]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] suddenly goes extremely gloomy. "...You could say that."
[31-Jan-2013 03:12:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> goes extremely gloomy* no particular quickness
[31-Jan-2013 03:12:33]  <IllFlower> I almost named Miaka's mother "Aoi", just to rub it in, hahaha
[31-Jan-2013 03:12:37]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((what))
[31-Jan-2013 03:12:43]  <Aoi> 14it's a girl's name.
[31-Jan-2013 03:12:47]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((well, shit.))
[31-Jan-2013 03:12:47]  <Aoi> 14"sorta"
[31-Jan-2013 03:12:56]  <Makoto> "...Pyunpyun did say it would probably be dangerous sometimes..."
[31-Jan-2013 03:13:01]  <Aoi> "The others told me about the fight.  That was, well.  I'm sorry I wasn't there, I didn't think she would be so... well, you know."
[31-Jan-2013 03:13:36]  <Makoto> "I broke my wrist once. And then another time I broke my toe. And then once I fell down the stairs and cut my head and had to get stitches."
[31-Jan-2013 03:13:43]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] makes a weird face at Aoi. Almost like betrayal, and then guilt for feeling betrayal.
[31-Jan-2013 03:13:57]  * Aoi winces
[31-Jan-2013 03:14:13]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "It's...okay, I guess. Kei's been...taken care of."
[31-Jan-2013 03:14:44]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "S-sorry, Makoto...I"m just, well. you can see. Is there something...specific you'd like me to answer?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:14:47]  <Makoto> "And then I fought a witch and fell like three stories but it didn't hurt that much! I guess because I'm magical now or something? Magic is pretty cool. You should /see/ how fast I can run now!"
[31-Jan-2013 03:15:29]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] thinks to herself. An athlete, huh.
[31-Jan-2013 03:16:00]  * Aoi tries to picture Makoto and Sumire meeting.  Fails to shake off the horror.
[31-Jan-2013 03:16:05]  <Makoto> @Miaka: "Eh? Well I dunno. I guess I'm just kind of excited. Pyunpyun mentioned other initiates a couple times but gosh I'm just kind of excited to finally meet another magical girl! And boy."
[31-Jan-2013 03:16:53]  <Makoto> "Did you guys fight a bunch of witches already? Are you /hardened veterans?/ Heh heh heh. This is so cool."
[31-Jan-2013 03:17:03]  <Aoi> "Makoto..."
[31-Jan-2013 03:17:24]  <Makoto> "Hmm?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:17:25]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] grimaces. "It's not so much fun, really. The real satisfaction is stopping witches, and even then..." Miaka looks away, muttering "Kei..."
[31-Jan-2013 03:17:36]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> the real reward is*
[31-Jan-2013 03:18:08]  *** JBridge <~JBridge@c-24-4-171-1.hsd1.ca.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Quit: EXPLOSIONS)
[31-Jan-2013 03:18:25]  <Makoto> "Oh. Yeah. That's why I made my wish, really! To fight witches. I didn't really care about the wish so much. Although it is pretty cool, heh heh."
[31-Jan-2013 03:19:04]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> She looks worse for wear. She turns back to the two other initiates regardless. "We'll...well, they'll. Teach you the ropes. Please stay safe, and..." she swallows. "Don't ever lose hope."
[31-Jan-2013 03:19:10]  <Makoto> "Hey, Aoi. What did you wish for? A billion yen? A lifetime supply of sushi?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:19:21]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((berb, don't stop))
[31-Jan-2013 03:19:29]  <Aoi> "I'll tell you later, Makoto."
[31-Jan-2013 03:19:38]  * Makoto shrugs. "Mmkay."
[31-Jan-2013 03:19:58]  <Aoi> "Miaka, we won't, alright?  Right now we're all hoping you'll be out of bed and fine before we know it, too."
[31-Jan-2013 03:21:12]  * Makoto salutes Miaka. "Absolutely! Hey, Pyunpyun told me earlier that there are a bunch of other initiates in this city too! Wouldn't it be cool if we all fought witches together? I bet we could be any witch working together like that! Heh heh, it's like being in a manga or something."
[31-Jan-2013 03:22:15]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] looks at Aoi again. "Did you tell her about what happened to us?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:22:32]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "About Kei?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:23:14]  <Makoto> ((Makoto Fujiwara. Highly sensitive individual.))
[31-Jan-2013 03:23:16]  <Aoi> "Kinda hard to get a word in edgewise here..."
[31-Jan-2013 03:23:24]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] glances at Makoto. Maybe she's being really harsh, but...she doesn't even remember everything that happened, herself...
[31-Jan-2013 03:24:07]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "Makoto." Miaka fixes on her for a second. "Let...I think you should let Aoi tell you what happened. To me and the others."
[31-Jan-2013 03:24:35]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((probably don't even have to RP that out, as I think spruce has read the sessions? or you cahn just be like "we'll wait till later" I guess))
[31-Jan-2013 03:24:42]  <Aoi> 14are we actually going to go through that because i only half read the logs
[31-Jan-2013 03:25:04]  <Aoi> 14after the 30 it was like uhhhhh
[31-Jan-2013 03:25:33]  <IllFlower> Aoi explains what happened to Miaka and the others. he's not sure about some of the details, but he can hardly make Miaka flesh them out, so he does the best he can.
[31-Jan-2013 03:25:44]  <Aoi> 14perfection
[31-Jan-2013 03:26:18]  <IllFlower> he tries to emphasize the less... sane parts of what happened, like Kei's little demonstration of her healing ability. **
[31-Jan-2013 03:26:44]  * Makoto seems to finally snap out of her oblivious hyperexcitement a little bit as she listens to Aoi's explanation
[31-Jan-2013 03:27:10]  <Makoto> "G-gosh... that's terrible... uh... I guess... I'm probably annoying Miaka-chan right now, huh."
[31-Jan-2013 03:27:34]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "N...It's. I don't want to scare you off, Makoto...you just need to understand. This is dangerous."
[31-Jan-2013 03:28:25]  <Makoto> "Pyunpyun did say it would be... but I don't care. It just means I'll have to fight extra hard now."
[31-Jan-2013 03:29:40]  * Makoto seems a little sobered, but determined
[31-Jan-2013 03:30:00]  <Makoto> "That's crazy though... it was another magical girl, huh...?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:30:14]  <Makoto> "And she turned /into/ a witch...?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:30:48]  * Makoto appears deep in thought
[31-Jan-2013 03:30:51]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] nods. "You just...that's what I meant to warn you about. Why you can't lose hope. That'swhat happens when you lose hope..."
[31-Jan-2013 03:31:06]  <Makoto> "Do you think... she got bitten by a witch?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:31:36]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun clearly skimped on the orientation materials with Makoto, which is pretty impressive considering how little he usually does. **
[31-Jan-2013 03:31:52]  <IllFlower> (or maybe Makoto just wasn't listening. who knows?)
[31-Jan-2013 03:32:02]  <Makoto> ((probably some combination of the two >_>))
[31-Jan-2013 03:32:12]  * Aoi looks at Makoto, incredulous at the girl
[31-Jan-2013 03:32:16]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] softly puts both hands to her head. The IV hangs in the air. It doesn't seem to be entirely exasperation, given what she's recalling right now.
[31-Jan-2013 03:32:28]  <Makoto> "Like... how does that work... I wonder if you could ward off a witch with fried soybeans... or sticky rice..."
[31-Jan-2013 03:32:40]  * Makoto appears to be dead serious
[31-Jan-2013 03:32:40]  <Aoi> "You okay, Miaka?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:34:41]  <Makoto> ((am i laying it on a bit thick...?))
[31-Jan-2013 03:35:09]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((no no, this is good, I think. I'm just trying to not seem like I'm okay with what happened :P ))
[31-Jan-2013 03:36:03]  <Makoto> ((As well you should!))
[31-Jan-2013 03:36:18]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "I guess." She starts lowering her arms. "If a magical girl is consumed with anguish, and she has nothing left to turn to...no emotional attachments to keep her chained to...I don't know how to say it..."
[31-Jan-2013 03:36:30]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "...but they become witches."
[31-Jan-2013 03:36:56]  <Makoto> "Hope, huh... Hmm. I think Pyunpyun forgot to tell me that part... or did I just forget...?"
[31-Jan-2013 03:37:00]  * Makoto shakes her head
[31-Jan-2013 03:37:04]  <Makoto> "It doesn't matter."
[31-Jan-2013 03:37:19]  <Makoto> "Because I'm never gonna lose hope!"

[31-Jan-2013 03:42:16]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] smiles slightly. "Here's hoping. Just please remember, whenever you're feeling helpless...you can always turn to your friends. Don't ever let them go."

[31-Jan-2013 03:43:22]  <aoi-> Was alone. By the end. 
[31-Jan-2013 03:43:46]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "That's...o-one way to put it."
[31-Jan-2013 03:43:52]  <Makoto> "So... what you guys are saying is... you wanna be my friends?'
[31-Jan-2013 03:45:15]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((should we roll for a bond check? like, to be on top of whatever makoto'll decide on later))
[31-Jan-2013 03:46:00]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((since she hasn't been much for offering consolation I guess it'd have to be a Magic relationship))
[31-Jan-2013 03:46:19]  <Makoto> ((I think Fury would be most appropriate))
[31-Jan-2013 03:46:22]  <IllFlower> yeah, that's fine. I'll count whatever works as part of Makoto's three relationships, and then the rest can be to NPCs of SpruceZeus' choosing.
[31-Jan-2013 03:46:33]  <Makoto> ((To her, her fellow initiates would be comrades-in-arms))
[31-Jan-2013 03:46:39]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((fury would be f- oh, true...))

[31-Jan-2013 03:46:56]  <Makoto> ((Oh is it?))
[31-Jan-2013 03:47:09]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((magic's like, comradery in being magical girls; fury is healthy rivalries; heart isl ike, close friends))
[31-Jan-2013 03:47:16]  <Makoto> ((Ugh. Let me look up the appropriate part of the manual again

[31-Jan-2013 03:48:17]  <Makoto> ((Can I roll to try and bond with both?))
[31-Jan-2013 03:48:27]  <IllFlower> yeah, go ahead.
[31-Jan-2013 03:48:39]  <IllFlower> 2d6+6 above 12.
[31-Jan-2013 03:49:11]  <IllFlower> the actual result doesn't matter beyond role-playing this scene; I'll make it a relationship with 0 Strain if you succeed.
[31-Jan-2013 03:49:23]  <IllFlower> if you don't, well, you might get some cold shoulders. ;)
[31-Jan-2013 03:49:49]  <Makoto> ((So a social roll would be 2d6 plus my social stat?))
[31-Jan-2013 03:49:55]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((yeah, hence +6))
[31-Jan-2013 03:49:58]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((I think?))
[31-Jan-2013 03:50:00]  <IllFlower> yup.
[31-Jan-2013 03:50:14]  <IllFlower> roll separately for Aoi and Miaka, I guess.

[31-Jan-2013 03:50:28]  <Makoto> ((okay, Aoi first, then Miaka))
[31-Jan-2013 03:50:30]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: worst MMO evar, man.

[31-Jan-2013 03:51:04]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((oh, you made one relationship. I guess you pick ,or we assume it was aoi))
[31-Jan-2013 03:51:07]  <aoi-> ((I think you should switch. ))
[31-Jan-2013 03:51:18]  <Makoto> ((Okay that would actually make more sense probably))
[31-Jan-2013 03:51:41]  <aoi-> ((Aoi's not the one going on about friends,  here.))
[31-Jan-2013 03:52:09]  <IllFlower> attribute? I'd go for Mg, personally.
[31-Jan-2013 03:52:29]  <Makoto> ((Okay, Magic relationship with Miaka))
[31-Jan-2013 03:52:43]  <Makoto> ((And pissing off Aoi >_>))
[31-Jan-2013 03:53:05]  <IllFlower> okay, done. you can come up with two NPC relationships as needed later on.
[31-Jan-2013 03:53:08]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] looks nervous. "I...well..." she reflects on what she had just said moments ago. "...Yeah, sure. I mean, the least I can do is help you learn, from here..."
[31-Jan-2013 03:53:54]  <Makoto> IllFlower: ((Does it need to be an NPC? Like if I get another player to agree to a relationship with my character, would you accept that?))
[31-Jan-2013 03:54:06]  <IllFlower> sure, that'd be fine as well.
[31-Jan-2013 03:54:26]  <Makoto> ((Oh uh but I guess it's kind of been established that she's never met another initiate before... or at least if she has, she didn't know they were... hmmm))

[31-Jan-2013 03:54:42]  <Makoto> ((I'll have to put some thought into it))
[31-Jan-2013 03:55:01]  <IllFlower> Ht relationships don't require any knowledge of common magic, so that's an option.
[31-Jan-2013 03:55:03]  <ponicalica> 14they met way pre-magical girl, then lost contact X amout of time before?
[31-Jan-2013 03:55:16]  <Makoto> ponicalica: something like that
[31-Jan-2013 03:55:24]  <IllFlower> Yui could be your bestest classmate friend or something.
[31-Jan-2013 03:56:03]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] smiles slightly at Makoto. "...At the very least, enthusiasm will help you keep going."
[31-Jan-2013 03:56:08]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((man goddamnit the rechner isn't booting up))
[31-Jan-2013 03:56:18]  <IllFlower> but that can come later. in the meantime, on with the show! like Barcode is already doing!
[31-Jan-2013 03:56:32]  * Makoto grins. "Okay, Miaka-chan! You got it! From now on, I'll fight for your sake!"
[31-Jan-2013 03:57:57]  <Makoto> "Maybe when you get better, we'll fight witches together!"
[31-Jan-2013 03:58:49]  <IllFlower> (if you guys could move this scene towards a conclusion, I'll go ahead and pick up from there.)
[31-Jan-2013 03:58:58]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((thought this was working pretty well as it was <_< ))
[31-Jan-2013 03:59:19]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((nless you got anything to cintribute, Aoi?))
[31-Jan-2013 03:59:36]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] smiles a little more broadly. "Thank you, Makoto. Though I'm...not even sure why I'm still here, I'll keep that in mind."
[31-Jan-2013 03:59:49]  <IllFlower> (oh, it's working well. I just want to give SpruceZeus a little combat training afterward, so whenever you're good.)
[31-Jan-2013 04:00:07]  <Makoto> ((I'm cool with how this turned out))

[31-Jan-2013 04:00:54]  <buttercupistiny> ((I'm fine with classmate stuffs, should you choose to go that route, mimudakki))
[31-Jan-2013 04:00:54]  <IllFlower> all right.
[31-Jan-2013 04:01:31]  <Makoto> ((hmm that might work. it would be easier to justify than a spazzy athlete like Makoto somehow having a past friendship with shy quiet ol Yuna))
[31-Jan-2013 04:02:15]  <IllFlower> Miaka and Makoto eventually wind down their conversation. Aoi mostly spends that time standing off in a metaphorical corner, but he seems not to mind too much.
[31-Jan-2013 04:02:33]  * aoi- smiles, though. 
[31-Jan-2013 04:02:34]  <Makoto> ((Let's go with friendly rivalry! Makoto would totally be all I AM TOTALLY GONNA SCORE BETTER THAN YOU ON THIS TEST and then get a C+ or something while Yui aces it XD))
[31-Jan-2013 04:02:51]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((hey, my sumire relationship is "sumire kept talking at me until I liked it", so. also hey miaka is an enthusiasm magnet and shit I'm reminded of-never mind)

[31-Jan-2013 04:03:36]  <IllFlower> after saying "good-bye", Aoi and Miaka head off. Aoi wishes Miaka well with a few words, while Makoto positively invents the new sport of jump-waving.
[31-Jan-2013 04:03:48]  <IllFlower> * Aoi and Makoto head off.
[31-Jan-2013 04:05:06]  <IllFlower> Aoi slides the door shut, and he makes his way back to the hospital entrance with Makoto.
[31-Jan-2013 04:05:55]  <IllFlower> for what it's worth, he seems to have a remarkable amount of patience, considering that she's still positively bouncing off the walls.
[31-Jan-2013 04:06:01]  * Makoto gets occasionally distracted by random things on the way out and asks a few completely non-sequitur questions to Aoi, which he mostly ignores
[31-Jan-2013 04:06:14]  <Makoto> ((oh oops should wait for the ** probably sorry!))
[31-Jan-2013 04:06:43]  <aoi-> ((Boo how could you so something so ooc!!!))
[31-Jan-2013 04:06:54]  <IllFlower> the two of them turn a corner to find a remarkably empty corridor, one that was fairly busy on the way here... **

[31-Jan-2013 04:08:02]  <aoi-> "Hm?  What a remarkably empty corridor.  Wasn't it fairly busy when we came in?"
[31-Jan-2013 04:08:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((shit do you both have horrible Sharp))
[31-Jan-2013 04:08:27]  <Makoto> "Eh? Hm. I dunno. I wasn't really paying attention."
[31-Jan-2013 04:08:30]  * Makoto shrugs
[31-Jan-2013 04:08:51]  <IllFlower> no, no Sh challenge necessary right now.
[31-Jan-2013 04:09:09]  <Makoto> "They probably all went to do... doctor stuff... or something."
[31-Jan-2013 04:09:24]  <IllFlower> at the end of the corridor, in front of the elevators where Aoi and Makoto entered, sits a... prize wheel?

[31-Jan-2013 04:20:43]  <IllFlower> Makoto steps back in a mix of confusion and terror, as the wheel begins to glow brightly, way too brightly for mere cardboard.
[31-Jan-2013 04:21:00]  <Makoto> ((okay back))
[31-Jan-2013 04:21:34]  * Makoto leaps back with a yelp. "Gah! This is no ordinary bad luck! I knew I shouldn't have left my lucky horseshoe at home!"
[31-Jan-2013 04:21:49]  <IllFlower> a series of spikes emerges from the outside of the wheel now, the spinning -- it's got to be metal -- the spinning metal looking like a combination of a dog collar and the guts of a food processor.
[31-Jan-2013 04:22:12]  <IllFlower> suddenly, a whole host of lights turns on in the midst of the darkness, looking like some warped variety show.

[31-Jan-2013 04:23:15]  <IllFlower> she looks around, her eyes searching for Aoi, but it looks like he's suddenly nowhere to be found.

[31-Jan-2013 04:24:52]  <IllFlower> "chores" sounded like "gotta go do stuff, might be a while."

[31-Jan-2013 04:34:55]  * Makoto yells "Transform!", although the latter part of the word is drowned out in a massive, extremely colorful explosion that engulfs her. In the narrow hospital corridor, the blast is deafening. When the smoke, fireworks, and fluttering confetti clears, Makoto's magical girl outfit, a dress decorated with diagonal stripes of a rainbow of different eye-searingly bright neon colors. She also sports...
[31-Jan-2013 04:34:56]  * Makoto ...a tiny, equally gaudy cone-shaped paper hat on her head, and heavy black boots
[31-Jan-2013 04:35:18]  * Makoto *colors, is revealed.

[31-Jan-2013 04:36:33]  <IllFlower> Makoto: all right, roll to attack. that's 2d6+9 in your case.

[31-Jan-2013 04:37:10]  * Makoto summons her weapon, a gigantic solid iron cannon, with a second, perhaps even more deafening explosion of fireworks. It's just as hard to look at as the rest of her, and bright red ribbons flutter from the handles. She hoists it and prepares to blast away her attacker

[31-Jan-2013 04:38:28]  <IllFlower> okay, 23.
[31-Jan-2013 04:38:39]  <Makoto> ((Is that a lot? It sounds like a lot.))
[31-Jan-2013 04:39:01]  <IllFlower> the witch won't bother to defend against that, so roll for damage..
[31-Jan-2013 04:39:05]  <Aoi> 14yeah.  that's just to hit, though.  damage is otherwise.
[31-Jan-2013 04:39:18]  <Makoto> ((What do I roll to figure out damage))
[31-Jan-2013 04:39:31]  <IllFlower> generally large TH means a good amount of OC, though, which increases damage.
[31-Jan-2013 04:39:46]  <Fiora> (1d6 + half your attack rounded down + 2 per OC)
[31-Jan-2013 04:39:49]  <IllFlower> Makoto: d6+Att/2+OC*2, so d6+4+2 in this case,

[31-Jan-2013 04:43:19]  <IllFlower> Barcode: it's a t-shirt cannon.

[31-Jan-2013 04:50:13]  <IllFlower> it essentially took 2 OC.
[31-Jan-2013 04:50:24]  <IllFlower> for two extra dice.
[31-Jan-2013 04:50:27]  <Barcode> right right, now I remember.

[31-Jan-2013 04:50:32]  <Aoi> 14you can defend.

[31-Jan-2013 04:51:24]  <IllFlower> 2m6+Def, unless you want to fall back on the automatic passive defense (Def+4, which in your case is 10, and would fail).

[31-Jan-2013 04:52:27]  <ponicalica> 14er, strain a lot
[31-Jan-2013 04:52:53]  <IllFlower> as far as things go, I wouldn't recommend taking OC. I think Makoto can take a few blows okay.
[31-Jan-2013 04:53:00]  <Makoto> ((yeah okay))

[31-Jan-2013 04:54:43]  <IllFlower> the wheel slowly lumbers over Makoto, then without warning tilts vertically, knocking one of its outer wedges into her, and sending her flying some distance.
[31-Jan-2013 04:54:54]  <IllFlower> 8 damage. Makoto's at 10 Resolve.
[31-Jan-2013 04:55:03]  <IllFlower> that's the end of round one. any attribute order changes?
[31-Jan-2013 04:55:10]  <Aoi> 14fine here.

[31-Jan-2013 05:05:24]  * Aoi sends a bolt of ice into the center of the witch.  It hits dead center, breaking the mysteriously target-looking heart into icy shards.
[31-Jan-2013 05:05:27]  <IllFlower> <Aoi> ehh, i was gonna let makoto finishi t off, but.... // perhaps she'll emerge from this a bit chastened :p
[31-Jan-2013 05:05:28]  <Makoto> "Dammit, my hat got burnt!"
[31-Jan-2013 05:05:56]  * Makoto prepares to unleash another volley, but Aoi just arrows it first
[31-Jan-2013 05:06:13]  <IllFlower> the witch shatters to pieces, melting into a puddle of water on the ground that quickly evaporates away.
[31-Jan-2013 05:06:30]  <Makoto> "H-hey! I totally had it under control! Like I said, it was just a lucky shot!"
[31-Jan-2013 05:06:45]  <IllFlower> the corridor lights turn back on again, and some faint late afternoon light seeps through nearby windows.
[31-Jan-2013 05:07:23]  <IllFlower> the usual stream of hospital traffic comes back down the corridor. one doctor walks up alongside the suddenly de-transformed Aoi and Makoto, pushing the button for the elevator.
[31-Jan-2013 05:07:32]  <IllFlower> "are you two going to the lobby?" she asks. **
[31-Jan-2013 05:07:37]  <Aoi> "Haha, you just accidentally exploded your face, ri-"
[31-Jan-2013 05:07:48]  <Aoi> "Ah!  Uh, yes, we are."
[31-Jan-2013 05:07:58]  <Barcode> ((side note, I was so nervous about this computer thing (the laptops' working again), I went to step away from where I was sitting and I sweat-slipped right off of my rubber slippers. also, congrats on your first victory, zoose))
[31-Jan-2013 05:08:36]  * Makoto sullenly follows Aoi, grumbling about cheating prize wheels
[31-Jan-2013 05:09:10]  <Makoto> ((A victory. Yes. let us call it that.))
[31-Jan-2013 05:09:20]  <IllFlower> the elevator dings open, and the doctor steps inside, pushing the button for the lobby, and then one in the middle of the building.
[31-Jan-2013 05:09:22]  <ponicalica> 14congratulations, Makoto
[31-Jan-2013 05:09:24]  <Barcode> ((hey, nobody takes on a witch alone :P ))
[31-Jan-2013 05:09:25]  <ponicalica> 14insert shinji here
[31-Jan-2013 05:09:30]  <ponicalica> 14great blue ball witch
[31-Jan-2013 05:10:05]  <IllFlower> the doctor steps out on her floor, leaving Aoi and Makoto alone as they leave the hospital. **
[31-Jan-2013 05:10:33]  <Aoi> "Hey, Makoto.  Question for you."
[31-Jan-2013 05:10:48]  * Makoto grumbles a little more, rather hypocritically, about what a showoff Aoi is, but loses interest in a few minutes and gets distracted by something shiny
[31-Jan-2013 05:10:57]  <Makoto> "...yeah? What's up?"
[31-Jan-2013 05:11:17]  <Aoi> "Your outfit."
[31-Jan-2013 05:11:21]  <Aoi> "Are those colors even real?"
[31-Jan-2013 05:11:42]  <Makoto> "Pretty cool, right?"
[31-Jan-2013 05:11:46]  * Makoto looks a little smug
[31-Jan-2013 05:11:56]  <Aoi> "Heh.  Yes.  Fits you perfectly."
[31-Jan-2013 05:12:17]  * Makoto grins. "Right? Doesn't it?!"
[31-Jan-2013 05:12:28]  <ponicalica> 14now imagine makoto and sumire together
[31-Jan-2013 05:12:47]  <Makoto> ((sumire has like a glowy chandelier dress right?))
[31-Jan-2013 05:12:50]  <ponicalica> 14yeah
[31-Jan-2013 05:13:01]  <Aoi> "If you're that bright it's a wonder your explosives don't seek you out all the time!"
[31-Jan-2013 05:13:08]  <Barcode> ((and you're both friends with miaka, whose outfit is blacker than the blackest black))
[31-Jan-2013 05:13:31]  <Makoto> ((How much more black could it be? And the answer is none. None more black.))
[31-Jan-2013 05:14:49]  <Makoto> "H-hey, cut it out, I'm fine! I told you, it was fighting dirty!" (under her breath) "knew I should have brought that horseshoe..."
[31-Jan-2013 05:14:59]  * Aoi just grins
[31-Jan-2013 05:15:54]  <Makoto> "Come ooonnnn, that doesn't usually happen, I swear! I totally defeated two witches already, all by myself! Pyunpyun told me I did a good job and everything!"
[31-Jan-2013 05:16:43]  <Makoto> "I only tripped like twice while I was doing it, too!"
[31-Jan-2013 05:17:16]  <Aoi> "With impeccable style, right?"
[31-Jan-2013 05:17:44]  <Makoto> "Like I have any other way of doing things."
[31-Jan-2013 05:17:50]  * Makoto insanely smug grin
[31-Jan-2013 05:17:50]  * Aoi dances circles around Makoto a few times as they walk out
[31-Jan-2013 05:17:58]  <IllFlower> Aoi and Makoto are so cute together, don't you think?
[31-Jan-2013 05:18:05]  <Makoto> ((pffff)
[31-Jan-2013 05:18:14]  <Makoto> ((is that like, game over, man?))
[31-Jan-2013 05:18:46]  <ponicalica> 14so how long before we start getting arc 2 settingshit
[31-Jan-2013 05:18:50]  <IllFlower> we may as well wrap it up there. go ahead and pick someone to give your gift XP to.
[31-Jan-2013 05:19:06]  <Makoto> 1xp to Aoi for being a fabulous bastard
[31-Jan-2013 05:19:09]  <Barcode> (("GET PAID TO WATCH PORN, START NOW!" spam emailers: really desperate))

[31-Jan-2013 05:19:25]  <IllFlower> I've already wiped 1 OC from each of your attributes, setting you both back at zero.
[31-Jan-2013 05:19:40]  <Makoto> ((resolve resets after every battle, right?))
[31-Jan-2013 05:19:46]  <Barcode> ((resolve does, yeah))
[31-Jan-2013 05:19:47]  <ponicalica> 14yup
