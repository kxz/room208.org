[08-Mar-2013 03:06:53]  <IllFlower> Yui, unable to get a hold of Yuna by phone, tries going over to her place, worried that something's gone urgently wrong.
[08-Mar-2013 03:08:21]  <IllFlower> It's not the shortest walk, but Yui manages to make haste, and before she knows it, she's stumbled straight into the bell on Yuna's door. **

[08-Mar-2013 03:12:08]  <IllFlower> Yuna does need to answer the door first, presumably. :p

[08-Mar-2013 03:15:07]  <Yuna> (are my parents home or something?)
[08-Mar-2013 03:17:19]  <IllFlower> Up to you. The simple option is "if they are, they don't mind letting Yuna answer the door."
[08-Mar-2013 03:17:47]  <Yuna> I just imagine maybe yuna isn't feeling so good...
[08-Mar-2013 03:17:51]  <Yuna> um, can I roleplay my mom?

[08-Mar-2013 05:26:53]  <Yui> I think we should talk to fluffbutt and probably sumire at some point. Dunno where pyun-pyun would be though. He said he was going to find Makoto.

[08-Mar-2013 07:00:29]  <IllFlower> I don't think the sourcebook has any rules for this contingency, so I'm just going to arbitrarily say it's a bit like a major breakdown: -3 to any magical challenges.
[08-Mar-2013 07:00:51]  <Yuna> ow
[08-Mar-2013 07:01:23]  <ponicalica> 14it wouldn't, since a more by-the-book game's response to Yuna throwing her flashlight was "the flashlight reappears in her bag"
[08-Mar-2013 07:03:18]  <IllFlower> I'm pretty sure it has more to do with the fact that voluntary rejection of magic isn't really something that most authors would think of.
[08-Mar-2013 07:03:57]  <Yuna> ((geez, really, even after having watched madoka?))
[08-Mar-2013 07:04:34]  <IllFlower> In any case, she's basically played out the psychological effects of something like a breakdown, so the mechanical effect fits.
[08-Mar-2013 07:05:18]  <Yuna> ((okay...)
[08-Mar-2013 07:05:27]  <Yuna> so... um... how do I get the flashlight back >_<
[08-Mar-2013 07:05:38]  <IllFlower> Yuna: It is admittedly a bit odd to play a magical girl RPG as someone who refuses to use magic.
[08-Mar-2013 07:06:11]  <Yuna> ((really??   sayaka's route had like, kind of many elements of this...))
[08-Mar-2013 07:06:40]  <ponicalica> 14yeah, but Sayaka isn't playing an RPG.  I guess what IllFlower's saying is that this is turning out to be an especially narrativist RP this route?
[08-Mar-2013 07:06:54]  <Yuna> ((but it's a narrativist RPG, isn't it?))
[08-Mar-2013 07:06:58]  <Nitya> 14narrativist huh what a surprise didn't expect that
[08-Mar-2013 07:07:10]  <Yuna> ((run by a narrativist GM))
[08-Mar-2013 07:07:18]  <IllFlower> Not from the perspective of the narrative, from the perspective of the player.
[08-Mar-2013 07:07:39]  <Yuna> ((... why?))
[08-Mar-2013 07:07:59]  <IllFlower> This is an exception, since it happened as a result of something that happened earlier in the game.
[08-Mar-2013 07:08:57]  <IllFlower> What I'm saying is, you don't really expect a player to join a magical girl game, and then be opposed to using magic.
[08-Mar-2013 07:09:12]  <IllFlower> Anyway, was that question about getting the flashlight back in or out of character?
[08-Mar-2013 07:09:15]  <Yuna> In
[08-Mar-2013 07:09:32]  <Yuna> ((I don't know, the idea of being a magical girl who's learned the evils of magic and wants to stop it sounds fun))
[08-Mar-2013 07:10:08]  <IllFlower> Magic must defeat magic!
[08-Mar-2013 07:10:10]  * IllFlower clears throat
[08-Mar-2013 07:10:26]  <ponicalica> 14oh man, Jackie Chan Adventures
[08-Mar-2013 07:10:40]  <ponicalica> 14ONE MORE THING
[08-Mar-2013 07:10:44]  <IllFlower> "Mayu, you said a witch had Yuna's flashlight?" **
[08-Mar-2013 07:11:55]  <Yui> Yes, at least I think so. The police stopped the people before anything happened though
[08-Mar-2013 07:12:38]  <IllFlower> "You'll have to get it back from the witch, then," Pyunpyun says to Yuna. "By force, most likely." **
[08-Mar-2013 07:13:19]  <Yuna> ((I thought the police had it?))
[08-Mar-2013 07:14:54]  <IllFlower> I'll take that in character.
[08-Mar-2013 07:15:06]  <Yuna> ((but I don't think Yui told me the police had it))
[08-Mar-2013 07:15:40]  <ponicalica> 14of course, the other problem is that Yuna and Sumire are at 3 Strain, so it'll be hard to get three magical girls to fight the witch
[08-Mar-2013 07:15:46]  <IllFlower> "Your flashlight is a magical object. Witches don't like letting go of those if they aren't forced to." **
[08-Mar-2013 07:15:52]  <Yui> wouldn't it be in an evidence locker, pyun pyun?
[08-Mar-2013 07:16:11]  <IllFlower> (actually, more)
[08-Mar-2013 07:17:10]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun looks around the room. "And as forceful as police can be, I don't think they would have had quite enough for that." **
[08-Mar-2013 07:20:02]  <Yuna> Would a witch... show itself to the police?  That seems weird...
[08-Mar-2013 07:20:22]  <Yui> maybe it poofs things like how pyun-pyun randomly appears
[08-Mar-2013 07:20:44]  *** Zia1 <~Zia@steams-wless-gw.resnet.wsu.edu> has joined #madokamadness

[08-Mar-2013 07:21:36]  *** Zia1 is now known as Zia
[08-Mar-2013 07:23:29]  <IllFlower> "I don't mean that it'd literally physically fight for it, of course. Witches are capable of subtlety." **
[08-Mar-2013 07:25:20]  <IllFlower> I want to try to wrap this up in the next half-hour, if we can. I didn't think I'd still be here at 2:30. :p
[08-Mar-2013 07:25:49]  <Yuna> sorry ._.
[08-Mar-2013 07:25:53]  <Yuna> I was too slow...
[08-Mar-2013 07:26:08]  <Yui> good gravy babe, it was both of us
[08-Mar-2013 07:26:25]  <Yuna> IC:  a-anyways.... Yui... I guess... I hope I won't be useless, but...
[08-Mar-2013 07:26:25]  <Yui> ((er, parentheses that))
[08-Mar-2013 07:26:33]  <Yuna> I doubt another flashlight would be much use...
[08-Mar-2013 07:28:08]  <Yui> another? you mean not retrieving your old one from the witch? I'm confused.
[08-Mar-2013 07:29:15]  <Yuna> I mean... until then I should get a replacement, right...?
[08-Mar-2013 07:29:19]  <Yuna> But I don't know if there really is one...
[08-Mar-2013 07:29:23]  <Yuna> or if it would work...
[08-Mar-2013 07:29:29]  <Yuna> Gah, sorry.  I just    feel useless again
[08-Mar-2013 07:30:32]  <Yui> You said you'd trust me, right?
[08-Mar-2013 07:30:50]  <Yui> we'll find a way to make this work
[08-Mar-2013 07:30:54]  <Yui> trust me.
[08-Mar-2013 07:31:00]  <Yuna> I... I guess so
[08-Mar-2013 07:31:16]  <Yui> ((I am falling asleep at keyboard at present>_>)
[08-Mar-2013 07:32:04]  <IllFlower> Do we want to call it here?
[08-Mar-2013 07:32:09]  <Yuna> ((sorry.... I guess so...))
[08-Mar-2013 07:32:15]  <Yuna> Yeah... Illflower... you should sleep
[08-Mar-2013 07:32:55]  <ponicalica> 14clearly, IllFlower, the solution is to move to the West Coast.
[08-Mar-2013 07:33:22]  <Yui> (cept the one falling asleep is a westcoaster))
[08-Mar-2013 07:33:29]  <IllFlower> Okay, then that's all for today. Number juggling as usual.
[08-Mar-2013 07:34:09]  <IllFlower> Yuna is now back in the running for magical girl-dom.
[08-Mar-2013 07:34:43]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, everyone. We'll catch up in a little over a week.
