[18-Jul-2013 02:28:56]  <IllFlower> Okay, we'll pick up right where we left off, with Hiroaki attacking Snezana.
[18-Jul-2013 02:29:07]  <IllFlower> Snezana: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AizHQ9KT342udC01ckhGcnpDRmlMX3NiNklIUEpDcHc # Order your attributes.

[18-Jul-2013 02:29:50]  <Snezana> alright
[18-Jul-2013 02:30:04]  <IllFlower> Remember that you can't use your Heart attribute.
[18-Jul-2013 02:30:11]  <Snezana> I'm aware of that
[18-Jul-2013 02:30:23]  <Sumire> 14wait why can't he use his heart attribute
[18-Jul-2013 02:30:29]  <IllFlower> Oh, I take it that means no defense. Okay.
[18-Jul-2013 02:30:33]  <IllFlower> Sumire: Rampage effect.
[18-Jul-2013 02:31:49]  <IllFlower> Okay, Hiroaki goes first (in accordance with the narrative, thankfully). He attacks.
[18-Jul-2013 02:32:01]  <IllFlower> +roll 2m6+7
[18-Jul-2013 02:32:01]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (1+3)+7=11
[18-Jul-2013 02:32:09]  <IllFlower> Snezana?
[18-Jul-2013 02:32:29]  <Snezana> ((I actually don't know what to do, this came up faster than I thought)0

[18-Jul-2013 02:33:38]  <IllFlower> Well, your current ambit is basically attacking everything in sight, so...
[18-Jul-2013 02:33:53]  <Snezana> I elect to clash
[18-Jul-2013 02:34:22]  <Snezana> +roll 2m6+8
[18-Jul-2013 02:34:22]  <rollermine> Snezana: (2+1)+8=11

[18-Jul-2013 02:35:24]  <Snezana> ((so is this representing the attack in the house or is this a follow-up on the street?))
[18-Jul-2013 02:36:00]  <IllFlower> I guess it happens immediately after Hiroaki knocks Snezana out of the house?
[18-Jul-2013 02:36:09]  <Snezana> alright
[18-Jul-2013 02:36:39]  * Snezana slams against the pavement, quickly righting herself before another attack, finding herself face to face against more of the mirrors
[18-Jul-2013 02:37:13]  <Yuna> (is hiroaki in the channel...?)
[18-Jul-2013 02:37:21]  <Sumire> 14hiroaki's an npc
[18-Jul-2013 02:37:27]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@108-91-87-34.lightspeed.cicril.sbcglobal.net> has joined #madokamadness
[18-Jul-2013 02:37:35]  * Snezana attempts to shatter the mirrors, striking them with her right fist, eventually she catches sight of where hiroaki is
[18-Jul-2013 02:37:40]  <IllFlower> Okay, 11 = 11 is a tie. Hiroaki would lose, so he's going to take a point of OC...
[18-Jul-2013 02:37:43]  <IllFlower> +roll m6
[18-Jul-2013 02:37:43]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 3=3
[18-Jul-2013 02:37:48]  <IllFlower> 14. Snezana?
[18-Jul-2013 02:37:54]  <Sumire> 14oh boy, npc oc
[18-Jul-2013 02:37:55]  <Snezana> I take two points of overcharge
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:02]  <Snezana> +roll 2m6
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:03]  <rollermine> Snezana: (3+4)=7
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:06]  <Yuna> (oh...)
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:17]  <IllFlower> Adding one to match.
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:20]  <IllFlower> +roll m6
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:20]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 5=5
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:23]  *** SpruceZeus is now known as SpruceZeus|away
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:26]  <IllFlower> 19 > 18. Snezana?
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:32]  <Snezana> I take on another overcharge
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:36]  <BGTB2005> 14this escalated quickly
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:41]  <Snezana> +roll m6
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:41]  <rollermine> Snezana: 2=2
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:42]  <Sumire> 14it really did
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:54]  <Snezana> ((and all I wanted to do was warn yuna))
[18-Jul-2013 02:38:54]  * BGTB2005 14waits for the popcorn to finish microwaving
[18-Jul-2013 02:39:05]  <IllFlower> Okay, same here, then.
[18-Jul-2013 02:39:07]  <IllFlower> +roll m6
[18-Jul-2013 02:39:07]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 2=2
[18-Jul-2013 02:39:12]  <Yuna> ((????))
[18-Jul-2013 02:39:15]  <Sumire> 14wow
[18-Jul-2013 02:39:19]  <IllFlower> 21 > 20. We're at the OC limit, so no more rolls.
[18-Jul-2013 02:39:23]  <Sumire> 14I guess there's still relatioship burn
[18-Jul-2013 02:39:38]  * Snezana is panting, her left arm spasms in an unnatural manner, almost as if it is getting torn from the inside out, snezana lets out what appears to be a feral scream but it runs silently
[18-Jul-2013 02:39:53]  <Sumire> 14can NPCs relationship burn?
[18-Jul-2013 02:39:55]  <Snezana> ((can I use this to do the void teleportation?))
[18-Jul-2013 02:40:37]  <Snezana> can we add hiroaki to the battle tracker?
[18-Jul-2013 02:41:13]  <IllFlower> NPCs don't have relationships, so technically no.
[18-Jul-2013 02:41:15]  <Sumire> 14I think Hiroaki's deliberately off.
[18-Jul-2013 02:41:39]  <IllFlower> Snezana: Yeah, his current stats are hidden, same as with a witch.
[18-Jul-2013 02:41:48]  <Saladofstones> okay
[18-Jul-2013 02:41:57]  <Saladofstones> my other window is having massive lag right now
[18-Jul-2013 02:42:03]  *** Snezana <~Saladofst@pool-70-104-149-221.lsanca.fios.verizon.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Shh, no dreams, only tears - kerry for president)
[18-Jul-2013 02:42:07]  *** Saladofstones is now known as Snezana
[18-Jul-2013 02:42:21]  <Snezana> Could I add a relationship burn to the mix?
[18-Jul-2013 02:43:03]  <IllFlower> You may.
[18-Jul-2013 02:44:06]  <Snezana> ((I can burn a relationship to get an extra overcharge right? Am I limited to one per turn?))
[18-Jul-2013 02:44:29]  <Sumire> 14an extra point.
[18-Jul-2013 02:45:01]  <Snezana> Alright I elect to burn a relationship strain to add +1 to my clash
[18-Jul-2013 02:45:45]  <IllFlower> The manual doesn't say, but I think 2 per roll (same as MBRW) would be sane.
[18-Jul-2013 02:46:11]  <IllFlower> And okay, 21 = 21 and Snezana has the higher base attribute, so she wins. Roll d6+4+6 for damage.
[18-Jul-2013 02:46:20]  * Snezana sees another attack forming between the lenses, a sudden flash of scorcher, standing before a burning field flashes through her memory. A second flash, of a man standing over her with a machete... Snezana completely snaps
[18-Jul-2013 02:46:32]  <Snezana> +roll d6+4+6
[18-Jul-2013 02:46:32]  <rollermine> Snezana: 3+4+6=13
[18-Jul-2013 02:46:38]  <IllFlower> 13 damage.
[18-Jul-2013 02:47:58]  * Snezana snezana suddenly becomes very still, a chill wind flows through the air, as if being drawn into a void. Suddenly Snezana vanishes from where she was standing and appears in front of Hiroaki, and grips his throat with both arms, the chill wind still being drawn towards her
[18-Jul-2013 02:49:52]  <IllFlower> Snezana's already used her turn to clash, so that's the end of the round. Attribute changes?
[18-Jul-2013 02:50:09]  <Snezana> none here
[18-Jul-2013 02:50:14]  <IllFlower> Any reactions from the other magical girls? Sorry you guys aren't really in the action.
[18-Jul-2013 02:50:43]  <Yuna> ((Um.... I'm not sure what I'm suposed to do.))
[18-Jul-2013 02:50:44]  *** Juan`BioshockInfinite is now known as Juan
[18-Jul-2013 02:50:56]  <Yuna> ((I think at this point I might be freaking out and panicing behind yui
[18-Jul-2013 02:51:05]  <IllFlower> Sounds about right.
[18-Jul-2013 02:51:25]  <Sumire> I think Sumire's too shocked by the turns of events.  Has she seen Snezana get this vicious yet?
[18-Jul-2013 02:51:57]  <Snezana> I think the closest has been me fighting the tree witch
[18-Jul-2013 02:52:18]  <IllFlower> That was with Yui and Makoto, too, so Sumire wouldn't know.
[18-Jul-2013 02:52:18]  <Sumire> 14Sumire wasn't there for that one
[18-Jul-2013 02:52:46]  <IllFlower> The only fight she's been in would be with the suits of armor back in episode 11.
[18-Jul-2013 02:52:57]  <Snezana> oh hey I still have a stopwatch don't I
[18-Jul-2013 02:52:58]  <IllFlower> The two of them have been in together, rather.
[18-Jul-2013 02:53:24]  <Sumire> pocketwatch but yeah both Snez and Sumire would have them
[18-Jul-2013 02:54:04]  <Snezana> okay
[18-Jul-2013 02:54:09]  <Snezana> turn 2, heaven or hell
[18-Jul-2013 02:54:11]  <IllFlower> Okay, we'll start with the second combat round.
[18-Jul-2013 02:54:43]  <IllFlower> Hiroaki goes first again. Let's try our luck with the dice a second time.
[18-Jul-2013 02:54:48]  <IllFlower> +roll 2m6+7
[18-Jul-2013 02:54:48]  <rollermine> IllFlower: ((6+5)+2)+7=20
[18-Jul-2013 02:55:13]  <Sumire> 14he is going to have some serious overcharge himself, isn't he
[18-Jul-2013 02:55:22]  <BGTB2005> 14pffffff
[18-Jul-2013 02:55:32]  <BGTB2005> 14He's an NPC, he'll be fine
[18-Jul-2013 02:55:35]  <Snezana> ((can I elect to clash again?))
[18-Jul-2013 02:55:38]  <Yuna> ((I think my entire neighborhood is going to explode))
[18-Jul-2013 02:55:39]  <IllFlower> It's what happens when you're fighting a berserk maniac.
[18-Jul-2013 02:55:41]  <IllFlower> Snezana: Yeah.
[18-Jul-2013 02:55:56]  <Snezana> I add two overcharge to the clash
[18-Jul-2013 02:56:14]  <IllFlower> Okay, roll 4m6+8.
[18-Jul-2013 02:56:19]  <Snezana> +roll 4m6+8
[18-Jul-2013 02:56:19]  <rollermine> Snezana: (4+1+3+3)+8=19
[18-Jul-2013 02:56:31]  <Snezana> aaand I add another point of overcharge
[18-Jul-2013 02:56:46]  <Snezana> +roll m6
[18-Jul-2013 02:56:46]  <rollermine> Snezana: 1=1
[18-Jul-2013 02:56:50]  <Snezana> well 
[18-Jul-2013 02:56:56]  <Snezana> you're just full of great rolls today aren't you
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:02]  <BGTB2005> 14I think I need to slow down my rate of popcorn consumption
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:02]  <Sumire> 14trollermine
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:05]  <IllFlower> Hiroaki adds a second point.
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:07]  <IllFlower> +roll m6
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:07]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (6+5)=11
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:13]  <IllFlower> Or a third.
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:17]  <Snezana> well shit
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:22]  <BGTB2005> 14hahahahahahha
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:29]  <Sumire> 14welp
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:41]  <IllFlower> 31 > 20. Hiroaki wins.
[18-Jul-2013 02:57:54]  * Snezana snezana tightens the grip around his neck, another flash appears before her... she imagines that she's gripping someone familiar... a family member... a mother?
[18-Jul-2013 02:58:14]  * Snezana lets go in shock, realizing that hiroaki is preparing a big attack
[18-Jul-2013 02:58:52]  <Snezana> ((its grief syndrome all over again))
[18-Jul-2013 02:59:10]  <IllFlower> Hiroaki manages to cast a series of mirrors around Snezana and himself, in spite of being nearly throttled. She looks at their reflections and sees, in Hiroaki's place... someone she knows, that she's close to... her hands begin to let go...
[18-Jul-2013 02:59:36]  <IllFlower> Hiroaki dashes away and sends the mirrors crashing down on Snezana's head, leaving them to do their damage...
[18-Jul-2013 02:59:45]  <IllFlower> +roll d6+3+6
[18-Jul-2013 02:59:45]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 6+3+6=15
[18-Jul-2013 02:59:53]  <IllFlower> 15 damage. Snezana's at 3 Rs.
[18-Jul-2013 03:00:09]  <Sumire> "SNEZANAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
[18-Jul-2013 03:00:49]  * Snezana freezes in place, watching all the mirrors fall upon her. Cuts... everywhere... a slice of the mirror reaches her neck... leaving an image of a machete falling

[18-Jul-2013 03:01:41]  * Snezana hits the ground, the wounds begin to have shadows flowing throughout them... but it seems like the toil is to much, blood leaks out of her wounds and is then forcibly drawn back into her body
[18-Jul-2013 03:02:01]  <IllFlower> Hiroaki looks at the other three magical girls standing frozen on the street. His expression is one of absolute terror. He struggles to say something, anything, but he sees Snezana emerging from the cascades of shattered glass and realizes that he has to move.
[18-Jul-2013 03:02:07]  * Snezana staggers to her feet, looking dazed at her surroundings
[18-Jul-2013 03:02:57]  <IllFlower> "She's going to go after you next if you don't do something!" Hiroaki finally manages to shout, not looking once at the girls. **
[18-Jul-2013 03:03:01]  * Snezana sees three shadow figures to her right... family members..?
[18-Jul-2013 03:03:34]  * Snezana snezana sees other shadows surround them... with machetes... instantly she yells and runs towards
[18-Jul-2013 03:03:41]  * Snezana them
[18-Jul-2013 03:03:44]  <Sumire> "Do what though?  We can't hurt a friend, can we?"
[18-Jul-2013 03:03:45]  <IllFlower> ("Not once looking back," rather. You know what I mean.)
[18-Jul-2013 03:04:05]  <Sumire> 14Yuna might object to this characterization of Snezana though
[18-Jul-2013 03:04:16]  * Yui grabs for Yuna's hand
[18-Jul-2013 03:04:29]  * Snezana is yelling in Serbian, "Look out, look out, they're coming!"
[18-Jul-2013 03:04:37]  * Yuna grabs for Yui's hand at the same time, her hand bopping into Yui's once before they manage to actually grab hold
[18-Jul-2013 03:05:00]  <IllFlower> We'll go to round 3. Any attribute changes?
[18-Jul-2013 03:05:13]  <Snezana> yes

[18-Jul-2013 03:07:00]  <buttercupistiny> kicking won't help.

[18-Jul-2013 03:11:58]  * Snezana stops, grabs her right hand, and falls to her knees and begins to cry... she can't see her... they're gone... the line of men with machetes close in... twisted smiles across their face

[18-Jul-2013 04:05:51]  <IllFlower> "What difference does it make?" he says, bitterly.
[18-Jul-2013 04:06:01]  * Snezana sighs
[18-Jul-2013 04:06:29]  <Snezana> "In the end, I guess it doesn't. Whether I had a reason... whether I didn't... I was used by people who claimed... not who claimed, who believed in justice... not just revenge
[18-Jul-2013 04:06:55]  <Snezana> "I think the least you can say of me is that I was... true to myself... once I knew I couldn't live with who I was... the constant fear... the paranoia
[18-Jul-2013 04:07:12]  <IllFlower> "I just watched you lose control of your magic. Never mind that you just admitted you're capable of killing others even when you *are* in control.
[18-Jul-2013 04:07:24]  * Snezana looks away
[18-Jul-2013 04:07:41]  <Snezana> "And you made it worse by attacking me."
[18-Jul-2013 04:07:47]  <IllFlower> "You can justify it all you want, but the fact remains that you're dangerous--to all of us, here--I was right to be suspicious--" **
[18-Jul-2013 04:08:11]  <Snezana> "If you wouldn't have attacked... I had it under control... yeah it was dangerous... but I got everyone out... I would have been alone"
[18-Jul-2013 04:08:27]  <Snezana> "I would have... control... but you attacked me... and thats when I lost control"
[18-Jul-2013 04:09:01]  * Snezana laughs, "You know, this whole time I was suspicious of you... convinced that you were scorcher... I guess I can say that much isn't true..."
[18-Jul-2013 04:09:09]  * Snezana struggles to turn around, sumire in tow
[18-Jul-2013 04:09:21]  <Snezana> "But why didn't you stop Yuna when she lost control?"
[18-Jul-2013 04:09:29]  <IllFlower> "No. No." Hiroaki's breathing is steadier now. "We both know that if I hadn't been here, you would have set your sights on them. You would have *torn* *them* *apart*." **
[18-Jul-2013 04:09:46]  * Snezana smiles
[18-Jul-2013 04:10:05]  <Sumire> "No.  She had us evacuate.  We would have been gone.  But then..."
[18-Jul-2013 04:10:32]  <Snezana> "You're worried about Yuna? That's why I stayed in the house. When... I go through those moments of 
[18-Jul-2013 04:10:46]  <Snezana> "lets call it insanity... I'm not capable of doing anything more than breaking down"
[18-Jul-2013 04:11:05]  <Snezana> "everything you saw was a breakdown, I was blowing off steam... trying to regain composure... not to hurt anyone"
[18-Jul-2013 04:11:22]  <Snezana> "You made it worse by attacking me, and when I stopped attacking... you 
[18-Jul-2013 04:11:33]  <IllFlower> 14Sumire: "But then the magic would have overrun her thoughts, her judgment, her compassion. She would have gone after you. That's what this rage does to people." **
[18-Jul-2013 04:11:34]  <Snezana> "You continued"
[18-Jul-2013 04:12:30]  <Snezana> ...
[18-Jul-2013 04:12:38]  * Snezana pauses, looking at sumire
[18-Jul-2013 04:12:54]  <Snezana> "Sumire... when you lost control... did you have... visions? memories that seemed to flash by?"
[18-Jul-2013 04:14:55]  <Sumire> "I don't think so.  It might be like dreams, where you always have them, but sometimes you just don't remember, but if so, I don't remember..."
[18-Jul-2013 04:15:55]  <IllFlower> I want to comment that Snezana would have been distinguishably berserk during the battle, if the massive amounts of voluntary OC didn't give it away.

[18-Jul-2013 04:19:10]  <Snezana> "In the end, my paranoia caused a lot of this."
[18-Jul-2013 04:19:26]  <Sumire> "Paranoia?  With Scorcher?"
[18-Jul-2013 04:19:32]  * Snezana lets go of sumire, slowly going upright

[18-Jul-2013 04:21:12]  <IllFlower> "You never answered my question," Hiroaki says, visibly angered. **
[18-Jul-2013 04:21:12]  * Snezana looks at her left hand
[18-Jul-2013 04:22:16]  <Snezana> "I have no need to, we already had a fun little dance, didn't we?"
[18-Jul-2013 04:22:35]  * Snezana begins to limp away, but turns around to Sumire
[18-Jul-2013 04:23:17]  <Snezana> "Sumire, I figure I owe you though, what questions do you have?"
[18-Jul-2013 04:25:46]  <Sumire> "I-i-is he actually telling the truth?  Would you have gone after us?"

[18-Jul-2013 04:26:06]  <Snezana> all these rolls
[18-Jul-2013 04:26:32]  <Snezana> "...Yuna, I would have gone after Yuna."
[18-Jul-2013 04:26:56]  <Snezana> "but... in the state I was in... I would have expended all of my energy before I got onto the street"
[18-Jul-2013 04:26:58]  <IllFlower> Just a second. Handling things in #yackfest.
[18-Jul-2013 04:27:04]  * Yuna is currently hiding behind some nearby bushes and trembling and has been doing this for the past while
[18-Jul-2013 04:27:48]  <Snezana> Oh so avenger showed up againh
[18-Jul-2013 04:33:16]  <Snezana> right so
[18-Jul-2013 04:34:39]  <Snezana> "Well, I have a feeling that Yuna isn't going to want to see me around for awhile, so I'll part ways for now, do you still have my knife sumire?"
[18-Jul-2013 04:34:58]  * Snezana goes over to where Yuna's house was, looking for the revolver
[18-Jul-2013 04:35:19]  <Sumire> "Maybe.  I ran out of the house pretty fast, but it might be in the jacket?"
[18-Jul-2013 04:36:20]  * Snezana feels her own pockets, 
[18-Jul-2013 04:38:11]  <Snezana> "Well... this was a loss"
[18-Jul-2013 04:38:30]  <Snezana> "you know what... just keep the jacket... hiroaki might have a point
[18-Jul-2013 04:39:04]  <Snezana> "We know well enough why I broke down, but you still have to figure out what happened to you."
[18-Jul-2013 04:39:16]  <Snezana> "And if Hiroaki knew that much about me, surely he's clever enough to figure out that riddle."
[18-Jul-2013 04:40:02]  * Snezana puts her hands in her pockets, looking towards Hiroaki, "How about the next time we meet, we do proper introductions? I'd like to..."
[18-Jul-2013 04:40:11]  * Snezana points towards the damage in the neighborhood
[18-Jul-2013 04:40:19]  <Snezana> "Not to be so indecent in front of the neighbors"
[18-Jul-2013 04:40:29]  <Snezana> "Anyways, where did Yui go?"
[18-Jul-2013 04:40:47]  * Snezana points towards some bushes, "I see Yuna over there."
[18-Jul-2013 04:40:55]  <Sumire> "She's behind that tree, trying to comfort Yuna.  Those two are really close to each other.  I'm jealous."
[18-Jul-2013 04:45:20]  <Yui> (irl I had fallen asleep on my spacebar))

[18-Jul-2013 04:53:22]  <Snezana> ((things seem to have stopped for now))

[18-Jul-2013 04:54:27]  <IllFlower> I think I'm going to have to call this episode over for now, unfortunately. We'll just have to leave things on an ambiguous note.
[18-Jul-2013 04:54:41]  <Section42L> IllFlower: did you see my comment in #yf
[18-Jul-2013 04:54:51]  *** Yuna is now known as Fiora
[18-Jul-2013 04:55:04]  * Fiora really has no idea why she was even asked to be here :/
[18-Jul-2013 04:55:14]  <IllFlower> My apologies. Thanks for playing. We'll pick up on finally-not-Tuesday-in-game next session.
