[22-Mar-2013 01:12:53]  <IllFlower> He walks the streets of Kikugawa shortly after sundown --
[22-Mar-2013 01:13:20]  <IllFlower> Fifteen minutes ago. Aoi's phone rings. It doesn't appear to be a number he recognizes.

[22-Mar-2013 01:38:59]  <IllFlower> Aoi's shadow cycles from short to long to short again as he walks from streetlight to streetlight.

[22-Mar-2013 01:40:53]  <IllFlower> He stumbles around the tree-lined paths for a little while, circling the outside of the park, looking for the person who called.

[22-Mar-2013 01:42:35]  <IllFlower> The voice issues from a gazebo a short distance from the path, half-shadowed by the park's flora. It's too dark to see who's there. **

[22-Mar-2013 05:36:45]  <Sumire> "It's...oh crap, Yui, where did you say we were headed?"
[22-Mar-2013 05:37:36]  <Aoi> "Oh, were her phonecalls about the same thing? This is so convenient."
[22-Mar-2013 05:39:12]  <Sumire> "Yeah, probably.  I saw her on your staircase.  They were going to see you."
[22-Mar-2013 05:39:46]  *** Xeniera <~Solstace@71-222-95-142.ptld.qwest.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[22-Mar-2013 05:40:06]  <IllFlower> (But we all knew Aoi was the popular one from the beginning.)
[22-Mar-2013 05:40:38]  <Aoi> Aoi attempts to convey an expression of B) over the phone, which comes out as a bit of incomprehensible breathiness.
[22-Mar-2013 05:41:15]  <Sumire> 14just so you know, Sumire still doesn't know what' went on with Kaede because you were really bad at explaining it. :P
[22-Mar-2013 05:42:17]  <Aoi> 14Obviously.
[22-Mar-2013 05:42:46]  <IllFlower> I figure he and Kaede are the only ones that stand any chance of understanding at more than a gloss level, myself.
[22-Mar-2013 05:44:31]  <Sumire> 14well, Yui's wish isn't all that different, what with the rewriting everyone's memories.
[22-Mar-2013 05:45:09]  <IllFlower> I mean their specific histories.
[22-Mar-2013 05:48:04]  <Sumire> 14so, um, what now
[22-Mar-2013 05:50:25]  <IllFlower> You should probably respond to Aoi's attempt at being cool over the phone.
[22-Mar-2013 05:51:04]  <Sumire> "...hello?  Did you say something?"  Sumire does not yet own a video phone.
[22-Mar-2013 05:52:05]  <Aoi> "You still haven't told me where the witches at."
[22-Mar-2013 05:53:02]  <Sumire> "...I think we're trying to find that out.  We're at the corner of " Sumire quickly reads off street signs.
[22-Mar-2013 05:55:38]  <Aoi> "Alright, see you in a bit, hopefully!"
[22-Mar-2013 05:55:57]  <BGTB2005> 14to Google Maps!
[22-Mar-2013 05:56:07]  <SpruceZeus> google.co.jp
[22-Mar-2013 05:56:19]  <Sumire> "Alright, see you!
[22-Mar-2013 05:57:12]  <IllFlower> And just like that, Aoi has a new dragon to slay.
[22-Mar-2013 05:57:42]  <IllFlower> That's all for this (special double-length) episode of Magical Burst!
[22-Mar-2013 05:58:12]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing. You did a bang-up job, Nitya.
[22-Mar-2013 05:58:18]  <IllFlower> We'll resume on Sunday.
