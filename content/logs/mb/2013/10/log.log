[17-Feb-2013 20:35:07]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's get this party started!
[17-Feb-2013 20:35:20]  * Makoto fireworks and confetti
[17-Feb-2013 20:35:26]  <buttercupistiny> I refuse. It is lent. no parties.
[17-Feb-2013 20:35:49]  <Snezana> then we shall have cheese for everyone
[17-Feb-2013 20:35:52]  <Snezana> except without the cheese
[17-Feb-2013 20:35:59]  <buttercupistiny> my boyfriend points out that it is also sunday which is also known as CHEATING DAY
[17-Feb-2013 20:36:50]  <IllFlower> It's Monday afternoon. Yui and Makoto are making the most of their holiday by going shopping in the city center.
[17-Feb-2013 20:37:08]  <ponicalica> 14Presidents' Day is a holiday in Japan? :P
[17-Feb-2013 20:37:39]  <IllFlower> The skies have been gray all day, but there's no imminent threat of rain, which is good, as today's pretty cold yet again.
[17-Feb-2013 20:39:06]  <IllFlower> The shopping district is a veritable forest of red and green, Christmas decorations still in full swing nearly a week after the fact.
[17-Feb-2013 20:40:04]  <IllFlower> With end-of-year sales in full swing, it's as good a time as any to be buying things... **
[17-Feb-2013 20:40:29]  <Snezana> ((buy Russian sushi! We make sure we are the only sushi in town worth having!))
[17-Feb-2013 20:41:38]  * Makoto has been busy and is already hauling around a good pound or two of sweets
[17-Feb-2013 20:42:38]  <Yui> Candy? Really Makoto? I should really pick up some yarn and such. I made Ami a hat and scarf and mittens, and I really should have thought to make some for myself. It's colder than expected!
[17-Feb-2013 20:43:43]  <Makoto> "It's fiiiiine, I won't spoil my appetite. I already ate!"
[17-Feb-2013 20:43:50]  <Makoto> "...takoyaki... and a chocolate bar..."
[17-Feb-2013 20:44:13]  * Yui rolls her eyes
[17-Feb-2013 20:44:30]  <Yui> a super balanced diet there to support your athletic prowess
[17-Feb-2013 20:44:37]  <IllFlower> You two get along so well.

[17-Feb-2013 20:45:27]  <buttercupistiny> ((we can't all be accupuncturists))
[17-Feb-2013 20:46:01]  <Makoto> "Ah... I should save some of this to take to Miaka later..."
[17-Feb-2013 20:47:01]  <Yui> "You should, I think she'd appreciate that. Letting her know she's not pushed out of our thoughts by sales"
[17-Feb-2013 20:47:50]  <Makoto> "...hey look, there's a soba stall over there!"
[17-Feb-2013 20:49:08]  <Yui> Haha, let's go! After soba, let's see if we can find some chocolate and some cheap candy canes. I think peppermint bark is just the thing for the season
[17-Feb-2013 20:49:34]  * Makoto 's eyes glaze over a little at the mention of peppermint bark
[17-Feb-2013 20:49:51]  <Yui> give Miaka a stash of contraband to tide her over
[17-Feb-2013 20:50:38]  <Yui> I know that look. That's the look Ami gets just before she dips her finger in whatever I'm making.
[17-Feb-2013 20:53:17]  <Yui> What kind of soba do you want to get, Makoto?
[17-Feb-2013 20:53:26]  *** BGT <~BGT@pool-96-254-124-236.tampfl.fios.verizon.net> has joined #madokamadness
[17-Feb-2013 20:53:34]  <Makoto> ((I don't even know what kinds of soba there are DX))
[17-Feb-2013 20:53:40]  <IllFlower> Here, I'll pick up.
[17-Feb-2013 20:53:54]  <ponicalica> 14Ramune, Makoto.

[17-Feb-2013 20:54:12]  <Makoto> ((i thought that was a kind of soda))
[17-Feb-2013 20:54:14]  <IllFlower> After a considerable amount of indecision on Makoto's part, the two girls finally agree on their orders, and sit down to eat for what feels like the fifth time today.
[17-Feb-2013 20:54:16]  <ponicalica> 14(it's the only soda brand in Japan I know of; I know it from RahXephon)

[17-Feb-2013 20:54:29]  <ponicalica> 14oh, soba, not soda
[17-Feb-2013 20:54:39]  <Makoto> ((oh haha, ponicalica, soBa is a kind of nood- yes))
[17-Feb-2013 20:54:45]  <Makoto> ((>_>))
[17-Feb-2013 20:55:16]  *** HDR <~BGT@pool-96-254-124-236.tampfl.fios.verizon.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Pichuu~n)
[17-Feb-2013 20:55:36]  <Makoto> ((IllFlower: Makoto is much like a hobbit in that regard. Gotta have that third breakfast. A growing young woman needs her energy after all >_>))
[17-Feb-2013 20:56:20]  <IllFlower> While Yui takes her time eating, Makoto tears through her plate, and eventually takes to making a rather significant dent in the sweets she's just bought.
[17-Feb-2013 20:56:49]  <Makoto> ((Oh come on IllFlower, that's totally unbelievable, she would /never/ do /that!/ >_>))
[17-Feb-2013 20:57:21]  <IllFlower> After their meal, the two of them head out of the soba shop, into a quieter part of the shopping district.
[17-Feb-2013 20:58:15]  <IllFlower> There's a small plaza here, set back a little from the majority of the traffic. It's pretty empty, as one might expect for such a chilly day.
[17-Feb-2013 20:58:56]  <IllFlower> Growing in the middle is an old, mottled tree, which is surrounded by some concrete space and a couple of benches.
[17-Feb-2013 21:00:17]  <IllFlower> The only person who seems to be there is a young woman with steely hair, her head turned to face the tree, an arm stretched out to touch its trunk.
[17-Feb-2013 21:00:31]  <IllFlower> (That's Snezana, of course, but neither Yui nor Makoto have any idea.) **
[17-Feb-2013 21:02:03]  <Makoto> "...but seriously, /you/ of all people turning out to be a magical girl? T'heck kind of odds you think it'd be that /both/ of us were? Jeez. The fates have a twisted sense of humor."
[17-Feb-2013 21:02:49]  <Makoto> (er, that'd be addressed to Yui, if it wasn't obvious.)
[17-Feb-2013 21:03:06]  <Yui> "Shhhh, Makoto, not out where people can hear! I mean not that there's really anyone around, but it's the principle of the thing! 
[17-Feb-2013 21:03:15]  <Yui> That said, I agree."
[17-Feb-2013 21:03:37]  * Snezana is talking to herself in her native tongue
[17-Feb-2013 21:03:53]  <Makoto> "Yeah yeah yeah... like, who would believe it anyway, thou- hey, who's that weirdo?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:04:34]  <Makoto> ((CULTURAL SENSITIVITY))
[17-Feb-2013 21:04:34]  <Snezana> "It seems weird how fate works out, I go all this way and I can still feel its presence"
[17-Feb-2013 21:04:42]  <Yui> "MAKOTO! You don't just call people weirdoes! It's not polite. First you have to get to know them, and then you can properly judge whether they're a weirdo or not!"
[17-Feb-2013 21:04:57]  <Makoto> "Okay. Yui, you're a weirdo."
[17-Feb-2013 21:05:21]  <Yui> "Agreed, but so're you"
[17-Feb-2013 21:05:51]  * Snezana sighs, glancing over to two particular people in the nearly barren plaza
[17-Feb-2013 21:06:19]  <Snezana> "well, the job isn't going to be done on its own, so I might as well go back to work"
[17-Feb-2013 21:06:37]  <IllFlower> Yui, Makoto, Sharp challenge.
[17-Feb-2013 21:06:48]  <Makoto> ((have to split for just a second brb))

[17-Feb-2013 21:07:55]  <Yui> welp
[17-Feb-2013 21:08:15]  <Yui> ((AVENGE ME MAKOTO, YOU ARE OUR ONLY HOPE))
[17-Feb-2013 21:09:44]  <Makoto> +roll 2d6+5

[17-Feb-2013 21:09:50]  <Makoto> -_-;
[17-Feb-2013 21:10:10]  <ponicalica> 14wow, all that soba is clouding your minds
[17-Feb-2013 21:10:30]  <IllFlower> lolololol
[17-Feb-2013 21:10:33]  <Yui> ((neither magical girl notices the new lady talking to a tree because that's totally normal behavior))
[17-Feb-2013 21:10:41]  <IllFlower> It's okay, you don't need a certain target score.
[17-Feb-2013 21:10:47]  <Snezana> ((For the record, it was under my breath))
[17-Feb-2013 21:10:56]  <BGTB2005> 14nothing to see here move along
[17-Feb-2013 21:11:45]  <Snezana> ((and too be fair, it was the best tree ever))
[17-Feb-2013 21:12:23]  <IllFlower> While Makoto seems to be obsessed with the fact that a foreign girl is standing next to the tree, Yui starts to see an odd dark fringe around its branches, rising and evaporating like a dark purple flame. **
[17-Feb-2013 21:13:20]  <Makoto> "Ooh. I bet she's one of those mysterious foreign exchange students you always hear so much about..."
[17-Feb-2013 21:13:44]  <IllFlower> (Makoto sees nothing, for what it's worth.)
[17-Feb-2013 21:14:11]  <Yui> "maybe so, but whether she is or not, I don't think being by the tree is a very good thing"
[17-Feb-2013 21:14:30]  * Makoto >:?
[17-Feb-2013 21:15:10]  <Yui> "it's got a sorta dark purple haze around it, can't you see it?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:15:38]  <Snezana> ((its been infested by the spirits of rock musicians))
[17-Feb-2013 21:15:42]  <Makoto> "...No?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:16:21]  <IllFlower> Out of one of the knots in the tree's trunk, near where the woman is standing, Yui sees something that looks disturbingly like an eye peeking out back at her...
[17-Feb-2013 21:16:40]  <Yui> "well, regardless, maybe we should go talk to he-eeeeeeeeeeep"
[17-Feb-2013 21:17:06]  <IllFlower> (Snezana, of course, has already figured out that there's a witch in there, but she has no idea whether Yui and Makoto are magical, so she's presumably trying to figure out what to say instead...)
[17-Feb-2013 21:17:30]  * Makoto still >:?
[17-Feb-2013 21:17:46]  <Makoto> "...a-are you just pullin' my leg, Yui...?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:18:10]  * Snezana backs slowly away from the tree, turns to face the two people still left in the plaza
[17-Feb-2013 21:18:17]  <Yui> Yui startles slightly and clasps her hands into fists straight down by her sides. "Do I seem like the sort of person who would pull your leg like this?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:18:20]  <Yui> "That
[17-Feb-2013 21:18:25]  <Yui> s a bad question.
[17-Feb-2013 21:18:41]  <Snezana> "Zdravo!"
[17-Feb-2013 21:19:08]  <Yui> "come again?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:19:23]  <Snezana> "Kako ste?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:19:41]  <Makoto> "Oh, I think she's American! ...or German, maybe...?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:19:52]  * Snezana smiles
[17-Feb-2013 21:19:59]  <IllFlower> As she approaches, Yui and Makoto begin to realize that "woman" might not exactly be the best descriptor to use for her. She looks to be about their age, but...
[17-Feb-2013 21:20:25]  <Snezana> "Isviniti, podite sa mnom"
[17-Feb-2013 21:20:26]  <IllFlower> Well, she's tall. Makoto does some thinking, realizing that this new girl is about Kaede's equal in height, if not taller.
[17-Feb-2013 21:20:29]  <IllFlower> **
[17-Feb-2013 21:20:53]  <Makoto> "Ah. I /really/ hope this doesn't turn out as bad as last time..."
[17-Feb-2013 21:21:05]  <IllFlower> (saladofstones put her down as being 185 cm, which is nearly six-foot-one, just so you know.)
[17-Feb-2013 21:21:38]  <Makoto> (whereas Makoto is a little on the short side. For a Japanese person.)
[17-Feb-2013 21:21:48]  <Snezana> ((A nice contrast))
[17-Feb-2013 21:22:04]  <Makoto> (wait haha you actually speak Russian, salad?)
[17-Feb-2013 21:22:24]  <Snezana> ((its serbian))
[17-Feb-2013 21:22:31]  <Makoto> (d'oh! =B)
[17-Feb-2013 21:22:45]  <Snezana> and this is pretty basic serbian
[17-Feb-2013 21:23:00]  <Makoto> (it's more Serbian than /I/ know >_>)
[17-Feb-2013 21:23:14]  <Makoto> (well okay "Zdravo!" is pretty easy to figure out)
[17-Feb-2013 21:23:32]  <IllFlower> Snezana: You'll eventually have to switch to a language the other two understand, just to be clear :p
[17-Feb-2013 21:23:48]  <Snezana> Illflower: I figure this is where meeting the familiar comes in
[17-Feb-2013 21:24:10]  <ponicalica> 14hahaha, Pyunpyun actually doing anything useful
[17-Feb-2013 21:24:58]  * Snezana suddenly twitches, as if realizing something basic
[17-Feb-2013 21:25:01]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun might as well be vacationing in the South Pacific, unfortunately.
[17-Feb-2013 21:25:15]  <Snezana> "Right they don't seem to understand"
[17-Feb-2013 21:25:33]  <BGTB2005> 14I hear it's nice this time of year
[17-Feb-2013 21:25:56]  * Snezana begins to speak japanese
[17-Feb-2013 21:26:02]  <Snezana> "All jokes aside, what are you two doing here?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:26:39]  <IllFlower> (For reference, I was thinking that Snezana can communicate day-to-day, if haltingly, but might need some prompting to explain more complicated things.)
[17-Feb-2013 21:26:46]  <Yui> "we were wandering around shopping. There's no school today." Yui holds up the parcels in her hands
[17-Feb-2013 21:27:04]  <Snezana> "You didn't hear about the bomb threat? We all have to go home"
[17-Feb-2013 21:27:22]  <Makoto> "Awha..."
[17-Feb-2013 21:27:32]  * Snezana takes a defensive stance
[17-Feb-2013 21:27:50]  <Yui> "no, I didn't, but perhaps more pressing than a bomb threat is the fact that there's something up with the tree behind you."
[17-Feb-2013 21:28:13]  <ponicalica> 14halfway through the witch threat, the shopping center explodes
[17-Feb-2013 21:28:33]  <Snezana> "So I was right, you are vestica. I won't intrude on your business"
[17-Feb-2013 21:28:50]  * Snezana begins to walk casually away from the tree
[17-Feb-2013 21:29:22]  <Makoto> "Weird stuff's happening again Yui... what should we do? You think there's a witch around here someplace?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:29:26]  <Yui> "No! Wait. Are you a, uh-ves? vestica too?
[17-Feb-2013 21:29:44]  * Snezana smiles again
[17-Feb-2013 21:29:52]  <ponicalica> 14vestica more like bestica
[17-Feb-2013 21:30:10]  <Snezana> "If you need to ask what I am, you don't need to know."
[17-Feb-2013 21:31:02]  <IllFlower> The tree looks to Yui now like it's part of a violet forest fire.
[17-Feb-2013 21:31:11]  <IllFlower> Even Makoto's starting to notice that something's up with that thing...
[17-Feb-2013 21:31:17]  <IllFlower> **
[17-Feb-2013 21:31:19]  <Makoto> "...hey wait. Do you know what's going on? How about you stop saying cryptic stuff and actually /help/ us, okay?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:31:21]  <Yui> very well. But if you're someone who can help, we usually work better in groups to deal with the weird stuff that happens.
[17-Feb-2013 21:31:32]  <Snezana> "Groups?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:31:34]  <ponicalica> 14Makoto, direct as always.
[17-Feb-2013 21:31:53]  <Makoto> ((she hates cryptic bullshit. Mostly because she doesn't understand it >_>))
[17-Feb-2013 21:32:06]  <Snezana> "If this is your territory, you can handle things yourselves, that is the rules, aren't they?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:32:22]  <IllFlower> Good, good. Keep going.
[17-Feb-2013 21:32:56]  *** AttObl|DarkForcesII is now known as SHODAN
[17-Feb-2013 21:33:05]  <Yui> Maybe it's the rules, but if it is a rule, Pyunpyun makes exceptions
[17-Feb-2013 21:33:11]  <Makoto> "Uh... Yui... I think you're right about that tree..."
[17-Feb-2013 21:33:21]  <Yui> I've never fought alone. Not once. Makoto, have you?
[17-Feb-2013 21:33:40]  * Snezana laughs softly, as if hearing a joke
[17-Feb-2013 21:33:52]  <Makoto> "Yeah, a couple times... but look. You there. Lady. We got work to do. So if you ain't got anything useful to say, you can just leave."
[17-Feb-2013 21:34:26]  <IllFlower> "I hate to interrupt your charming conversation, but..."
[17-Feb-2013 21:34:27]  <Snezana> "I'll leave you to your... teamwork then"
[17-Feb-2013 21:34:40]  * Snezana moves to leave the plaza
[17-Feb-2013 21:35:24]  <IllFlower> Whatever's inside the tree, of course, can't talk, but what it does at that moment basically says it all.
[17-Feb-2013 21:35:51]  <IllFlower> Straight, purple vines shoot out from the base of the tree, like spokes on a wheel, all the way to the outside of the plaza.
[17-Feb-2013 21:36:39]  <IllFlower> The surrounding buildings seem to shift and writhe, before being swallowed entirely by a suffocating darkness.
[17-Feb-2013 21:37:01]  * Makoto transforms almost reflexively, filling the plaza with confetti and fireworks. Yui, having been standing directly next to Makoto, is nearly deafened by the blast.
[17-Feb-2013 21:37:02]  <IllFlower> Snezana, who just a moment before had been making tracks for the outside, finds now that her exit is blocked. **
[17-Feb-2013 21:37:14]  * Snezana turns around
[17-Feb-2013 21:37:32]  <Snezana> "darkness? it looks like we were drawn by the same thing after all
[17-Feb-2013 21:37:56]  * Makoto adjusts her hat
[17-Feb-2013 21:38:02]  * Yui once again rolls her eyes at Makoto, and turns to Snezana
[17-Feb-2013 21:38:23]  <Makoto> "T'heck with all this chatter. Let's just kill this thing"
[17-Feb-2013 21:38:28]  <Yui> "it would appear so. So what are you going to do now?"
[17-Feb-2013 21:39:55]  <IllFlower> A loud "crack" issues from the tree's barren branches, and it begins to split in two from the top of its trunk.
[17-Feb-2013 21:40:02]  * Makoto 's cannon drops dramatically out of the sky, visibly cracking whatever passes for ground in the labyrinth. She hauls it up into firing position, adjusting her grip on it.
[17-Feb-2013 21:40:03]  * Snezana is engulfed by a black sphere, there is a wind, almost as if the air is being sucked into the sphere. Snezana emerges wearing what appears to be clothing made of emptiness
[17-Feb-2013 21:40:39]  <IllFlower> A bright yellow beam emerges and hits the ceiling of the dark dome, which pulsates first with a light blue.
[17-Feb-2013 21:41:10]  <Snezana> ((ugh, that was an awful description I made))
[17-Feb-2013 21:41:12]  * Yui stands momentarily frozen in terror and then regains her bearings and transforms.
[17-Feb-2013 21:41:55]  <IllFlower> Up above the initiates, a clear sky emerges, then lower on the walls, green grass -- except it doesn't move like grass, more like the hairs of a microorganism...
[17-Feb-2013 21:42:14]  * Snezana scans the developing witch, looking for weaknesses
[17-Feb-2013 21:42:36]  <Snezana> ((If I got the rules right, can I roll to read the enemy?))
[17-Feb-2013 21:42:51]  <ponicalica> 14you have to select attributes first
[17-Feb-2013 21:42:51]  <IllFlower> Underneath, the concrete fades away, replaced by wet soil. A few dead worms sit in puddles.

[17-Feb-2013 21:44:24]  <IllFlower> From the husk of the tree, a beige plant emerges, looking less like anything arboreal and more like the twisted fingers of a dessicated leaf beast...
[17-Feb-2013 21:44:38]  <IllFlower> We'll get started with battle. Pick your attribute order.

[17-Feb-2013 22:02:48]  <IllFlower> It's a whole-turn action.
[17-Feb-2013 22:02:58]  <IllFlower> All right, next round. Any attribute changes?
[17-Feb-2013 22:03:02]  <IllFlower> Makoto: I'm keeping track of it.
[17-Feb-2013 22:03:10]  <Snezana> I'm good
[17-Feb-2013 22:03:12]  * Makoto is a garish rainbow blur as she leaps over one gnarled root and rolls under another

[17-Feb-2013 22:06:26]  <Snezana> the damage
[17-Feb-2013 22:06:32]  <IllFlower> Woefully inadequate, as expected. Attack double-succeeds. You don't even need to roll for damage, as it's fatal.
[17-Feb-2013 22:06:56]  <IllFlower> Makoto: Yeah?
[17-Feb-2013 22:06:59]  <Makoto> (okay let me describe the attack real quick)
[17-Feb-2013 22:07:04]  <Makoto> (nvm it's no longer relevant
[17-Feb-2013 22:08:32]  <Makoto> A gigantic noisemaker appears at Makoto's feet as she runs along, unfurling into the air with a hellishly loud buzzing noise. Running along it, she leaps off the end and straight at the witch's face, firing a blast from her cannon.

[17-Feb-2013 22:09:42]  * Snezana sits down
[17-Feb-2013 22:09:50]  <IllFlower> A hole opens up straight through the witch's "hand," which falls away as a harmless leaf shower.
[17-Feb-2013 22:10:02]  <Snezana> "this proved to be a productive use of my time."
[17-Feb-2013 22:10:29]  <IllFlower> The maze's sky and ground dissolve away, leaving the initiates back in the plaza with a split-open tree.
[17-Feb-2013 22:11:13]  <Makoto> A detransformed Makoto leans back against the destroyed tree, arms crossed, a highly smug expression on her face.
[17-Feb-2013 22:11:18]  <Snezana> "congratulations, you killed a demon tree."
[17-Feb-2013 22:11:22]  <IllFlower> It looks as if it's been hit by... even a lightning strike doesn't seem right. Maybe Zeus hammered a nail into it or something.

[17-Feb-2013 22:11:46]  <Makoto> (moar liek Makoto shot a firework into it)

[17-Feb-2013 22:13:32]  <IllFlower> Oh, hm, I messed up in witch creation. Shouldn't have been able to do a burst and act twice simultaneously. Whoops. >_< Oh, well.

[17-Feb-2013 22:16:38]  * Snezana sits back down, staring blankly upwards
[17-Feb-2013 22:17:21]  <buttercupistiny> well, Snezana, do you at least see what I meant by working better in groups, it's not that we can't fight alone, it's a matter of efficiency.

[17-Feb-2013 22:37:32]  <Makoto> "Wonder what she meant, though. About using magic for other stuff? We're not supposed to let anybody know about this stuff, right?"
