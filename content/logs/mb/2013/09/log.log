@time=2013-02-14T05:24:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :another point of Overcharge. I take it you'll want it on Mg.
@time=2013-02-14T05:24:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(looking at the other effects and none of them seem to fit too well here...)
@time=2013-02-14T05:24:48.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14mmhmm
@time=2013-02-14T05:25:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :okay, we'll go on with Sumire losing her cool a bit at this unexpected revelation.
@time=2013-02-14T05:25:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :not fly-off-the-handle bad. that's for if you had rolled below 12. :p
@time=2013-02-14T05:26:37.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"...it's like...like my life's been ripped out from under me...I don't know whether to trust Pyunpyun's memories or my own."
@time=2013-02-14T05:27:45.000Z :Makoto PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"...okay. Tell ya what we've gotta do. Let's find that witch that's still skulking around someplace, and smash it. Right?"
@time=2013-02-14T05:28:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Pyunpyun opens his mouth to speak, but stops as Makoto chips in. **
@time=2013-02-14T05:28:27.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14Makoto is really excited about this witch-killing business.  I think she might be a McCarthyist.
@time=2013-02-14T05:29:10.000Z :Makoto PRIVMSG #madokamadness :((Well it's pretty much the only thing she has any idea about, so))

@time=2013-02-14T05:31:40.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :«We can't find any witches, though, considering how useless that «magical tug» thing was...»
@time=2013-02-14T05:32:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Makoto would object, seeing as how she definitely can't say that her internal witch radar wasn't persuasive, but even she can't feel anything now.
@time=2013-02-14T05:32:44.000Z :Makoto PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Ah, I was hot on its trail! I only stopped 'cause I ran into what's-her-face."
@time=2013-02-14T05:33:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :perhaps the witch gave them the slip while they were distracted by Kaede... **
@time=2013-02-14T05:33:11.000Z :Makoto PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Although... I'm not really picking up anything anymore... guess we all got a little distracted. Least I don't feel like I'm about to puke anymore."
@time=2013-02-14T05:34:18.000Z :Makoto PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I still can't believe it though. What are the odds of a bunch of freaky stuff like that happening just when we were about to catch it?"
@time=2013-02-14T05:34:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :considering what campaign you're in, the answer is "pretty high" :p
@time=2013-02-14T05:35:09.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14yeah, pretty sure IllFlower and freaky shit belong in the same spot all the time

@time=2013-02-14T05:38:07.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I don't know.  Has anything like this ever occurred, Pyunpyun?"
@time=2013-02-14T05:39:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"memories are volatile things," Pyunpyun says cryptically. "the only thing that's for certain is that it's hard to deny the reality of one's own."

@time=2013-02-14T05:48:03.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14I have no objection to cliffhanging.  will we still get to take off a point of OC, since it doesn't seem like there's a good place to take fallout
@time=2013-02-14T05:48:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, we've covered all the ground I wanted to this session. XP gifting and OC removal as usual.
@time=2013-02-14T05:48:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Fiora as well.
@time=2013-02-14T05:49:03.000Z :Makoto PRIVMSG #madokamadness :okay one point to Sumire I guess
@time=2013-02-14T05:49:26.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :one to Makoto for almost punching Kaede
@time=2013-02-14T05:49:28.000Z :Yuna PRIVMSG #madokamadness :((um, I hardly did anything... I just kind of ran off, does that count as a session))
@time=2013-02-14T05:49:33.000Z :Makoto PRIVMSG #madokamadness :because everything's made up and the points don't matter
@time=2013-02-14T05:50:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yuna: you can still gift 1 XP.

@time=2013-02-14T05:51:14.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14do the XP have any use though, since we're just doing an advance per round
@time=2013-02-14T05:51:20.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14er, per arc
@time=2013-02-14T05:51:54.000Z :Makoto PRIVMSG #madokamadness :presumably they are for IllFlower's mysterious and inscrutable purposes.
@time=2013-02-14T05:52:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm using them for bookkeeping purposes at the very least. I might award extra Advances to people with unusual amounts of XP.
@time=2013-02-14T05:52:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :anyway, that's curtains for tonight. we'll pick up on Sunday. thanks for playing, everyone.
