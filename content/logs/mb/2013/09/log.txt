[14-Feb-2013 02:11:45]  <IllFlower> anyway, let's go ahead and get this session started!
[14-Feb-2013 02:11:52]  <Makoto> aw yiss
[14-Feb-2013 02:11:54]  <Sumire> 14let's go!
[14-Feb-2013 02:12:27]  * Yuna casts healing massages on IllFlower 
[14-Feb-2013 02:13:08]  <IllFlower> it's Sunday afternoon. the weather outside is pleasant, or at least as pleasant as it can be in late December, which is to say that it's still cold and dry, but at least not windy.
[14-Feb-2013 02:13:52]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun is addressing the initiates from a perch on top of a low retaining wall on one of Kikugawa's nondescript suburban streets.
[14-Feb-2013 02:14:57]  <IllFlower> "so, how is everyone feeling today?" he asks. it seems a bit unfair that he doesn't have to wear a coat, scarf, and earmuffs like everyone else. **
[14-Feb-2013 02:15:31]  * Makoto seems to be especially antsy, and is fidgeting constantly
[14-Feb-2013 02:15:31]  <Sumire> "Cold and tired."
[14-Feb-2013 02:15:53]  <Makoto> "Feels like it's been /weeks/ since you sent me out witch hunting, fuzzface!"
[14-Feb-2013 02:16:05]  <Sumire> 14I believe it's fuzzbutt
[14-Feb-2013 02:16:11]  <Makoto> ((sssh))
[14-Feb-2013 02:16:12]  <IllFlower> "technically, Makoto, it's only been one week." **
[14-Feb-2013 02:16:48]  <Yuna> ((isn't that a standard, not specially, level of antsy for makoto)
[14-Feb-2013 02:16:51]  <Makoto> "...MONTHS, maybe! Where's the bad guy at?"
[14-Feb-2013 02:17:51]  <IllFlower> "now, now, Makoto..." Pyunpyun tries to pull his best motherly voice, though it just ends up sounding sarcastic, coming from a creature the size of a housepet.
[14-Feb-2013 02:18:38]  <IllFlower> "anyway, that's why I've asked you all here. I've detected some activity around this neighborhood, but I don't know specifically where.
[14-Feb-2013 02:18:49]  *** saladofstonesdidntmakeit is now known as saladofstones
[14-Feb-2013 02:18:59]  <Sumire> "Didn't you know where they were the last few times?  What's different this time?"
[14-Feb-2013 02:19:00]  * Yuna stands quietly a bit behind and to the side of Sumire, a bit nervous around this new, rather outgoing person.
[14-Feb-2013 02:19:25]  <IllFlower> "you're all probably a little tired after coming all the way across town, but I'll need you three to go out on foot to find the witch this time."
[14-Feb-2013 02:20:30]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun addresses Sumire's question. "it's a bit like quantum physics. I don't really understand how it works, but there are probabilities involved. I think." **
[14-Feb-2013 02:21:18]  * Makoto glances around suspiciously, as if expecting to see a witch lurking behind a nearby car
[14-Feb-2013 02:21:51]  <Sumire> "...so how do we do any of this if you can't?"
[14-Feb-2013 02:22:21]  <IllFlower> "there are three of you, and one of me. I'm hoping you'll have better luck." **
[14-Feb-2013 02:22:43]  <Sumire> 14 Pyunpyun, you're a dick.
[14-Feb-2013 02:22:46]  * Yuna mutters "S-sometimes it almost feels like the witches have a way of finding... us."
[14-Feb-2013 02:23:59]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun looks at Sumire and frowns. she didn't say anything out loud, but whatever she's thinking is written all over her face, and Pyunpyun doesn't like it.
[14-Feb-2013 02:24:02]  <IllFlower> [;)]
[14-Feb-2013 02:24:16]  <Makoto> "Hmm. So what're we gonna do...? It's not like witches are listed in the phone book or anything. ...right?"
[14-Feb-2013 02:24:32]  <Sumire> "Not the last time I checked.  I guess we'll just going to go out and find it!"
[14-Feb-2013 02:24:39]  <Makoto> "What do witches like to eat? Maybe we could set a trap!"
[14-Feb-2013 02:24:47]  <Sumire> "I think they like to eat people."
[14-Feb-2013 02:24:56]  <Nitya> 14organize a flashmob!
[14-Feb-2013 02:25:13]  <Nitya> 14"hey peeps could you walk over here in suburban alleyways and wait for a surprise thanks"
[14-Feb-2013 02:25:18]  <Makoto> "Ah... I vote Yuna to be the bait then!"
[14-Feb-2013 02:25:28]  <IllFlower> "I don't think that'll be necessary..." Pyunpyun interjects.
[14-Feb-2013 02:27:03]  * Fiora flails "I-I-- no, I am not going to be the bait!  You... you first!"
[14-Feb-2013 02:27:52]  * Nitya 14chuckles
[14-Feb-2013 02:28:00]  <IllFlower> "Mayu told me about how she was able to sense Kei when you all were looking for her. it'd be best to try tuning into those same magical frequencies first, before putting Yuna on a hook and stringing her up."
[14-Feb-2013 02:28:02]  <Yuna> ((AGH wrong window;.  again))
[14-Feb-2013 02:28:04]  <IllFlower> **
[14-Feb-2013 02:28:18]  <Sumire> 14it's okay, nobody noticed, Yuna.  Even IllFlower mixes Yuna and Fiora up!
[14-Feb-2013 02:28:21]  * Makoto looks sheepish
[14-Feb-2013 02:28:37]  <Makoto> "Hahaha... right... magic. Since we're magical girls. Heh."
[14-Feb-2013 02:28:55]  * Fiora looks a bit distraught.  "I don't want to be strung up..."
[14-Feb-2013 02:29:02]  <Sumire> "Unfortunately, I remember Kei, and I remember sensing nothing.  You probably should have brought in someone less helpless."
[14-Feb-2013 02:29:17]  * Makoto puts an arm around Yuna and musses up her hair
[14-Feb-2013 02:29:26]  <Makoto> "Naww, I was just kiddin', Yuna-chan!'
[14-Feb-2013 02:29:51]  * Yuna shuffles to the side out of Makoto's reach and looks away.
[14-Feb-2013 02:30:17]  <Makoto> "So uhh... hmm... how does this work..."
[14-Feb-2013 02:30:23]  <IllFlower> "it's the best we can do," Pyunpyun says to Sumire, "short of walking up and down every street and alley this side of the river. would you rather do that?" **
[14-Feb-2013 02:30:28]  * Makoto sits down on the sidewalks in the lotus position
[14-Feb-2013 02:30:42]  <Sumire> "I'd rather you do this weird magic stuff, fuzzbutt."
[14-Feb-2013 02:30:51]  <Yuna> ((is this where we do a Locate check?  or do we use sorcery or something))
[14-Feb-2013 02:32:26]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun sighs to himself. "teenagers never get any less mouthy, do they?"
[14-Feb-2013 02:32:36]  <Makoto> "Okay... just gotta... think witchy thoughts..."
[14-Feb-2013 02:32:49]  <Nitya> boil, boil, toil and trouble
[14-Feb-2013 02:32:56]  <Makoto> ((lol))
[14-Feb-2013 02:32:58]  <IllFlower> he turns his head to address the initiates again. "anyway, I'll leave you to your own devices. call me if you need anything!"
[14-Feb-2013 02:33:17]  <IllFlower> he leaps off the wall, vanishing into a few rosebushes behind it. **
[14-Feb-2013 02:33:19]  <Nitya> 14gotta catch up on my soaps
[14-Feb-2013 02:34:31]  <IllFlower> Makoto: roll a Sharp challenge. 2d6+Sh.
[14-Feb-2013 02:34:55]  <Makoto> +roll 2d6+5
[14-Feb-2013 02:34:55]  <rollermine> Makoto: (6+6)+5=17
[14-Feb-2013 02:35:01]  <Makoto> >:o
[14-Feb-2013 02:35:58]  <Nitya> 14so sharp imma cut some suckas up
[14-Feb-2013 02:36:24]  <Sumire> "So Makoto, did you find any witchy thoughts?"
[14-Feb-2013 02:36:26]  <IllFlower> as the other two girls are left to ponder where Pyunpyun could possibly have to be, Makoto suddenly feels a strong tug at her heart, one that seems to be pulling her down the street. **
[14-Feb-2013 02:36:37]  <Makoto> ((so sharp i could puncture the hull of a fire nation battlecruiser leading to the deaths of everyone aboard!))
[14-Feb-2013 02:36:41]  <Makoto> ((cuz i'm so sharp))
[14-Feb-2013 02:36:59]  * Makoto leaps upright with a strangled yelp
[14-Feb-2013 02:37:12]  * Sumire follows Makoto, slightly confused
[14-Feb-2013 02:37:21]  * Makoto dashes off at top speed
[14-Feb-2013 02:37:48]  <Makoto> "Guys! I did it! Somehow!"
[14-Feb-2013 02:38:24]  <Makoto> "It's like... it's like it's tugging on my heart... it feels kinda gross..."
[14-Feb-2013 02:39:54]  * Yuna nervously follows Sumire
[14-Feb-2013 02:40:28]  <IllFlower> Makoto's sudden jump-and-dash draws the attention of a pair of middle-aged women across the street, who seemed to have been in the middle of some lively neighborhood gossip.
[14-Feb-2013 02:40:59]  <IllFlower> it does look a bit like some comedy routine, with Makoto running off at top speed, Sumire and Yuna stumbling to follow along behind her.
[14-Feb-2013 02:41:47]  <IllFlower> the tugging eventually comes to a stop at an intersection, next to a boring-looking apartment block.
[14-Feb-2013 02:42:13]  *** TOKAM <~TOKAM@107.48.75.49> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
[14-Feb-2013 02:42:17]  <IllFlower> a boy about the initiates' age is hanging laundry up on one of the balconies. "you look excited!" he yells to Makoto. **
[14-Feb-2013 02:42:46]  <Makoto> ((That's my secret. I'm /always/ excited.))
[14-Feb-2013 02:44:06]  <Makoto> "Sorry can't talk gotta save the world and stuff!" yells Makoto, and begins dashing around in circles looking for anything out of the ordinary.
[14-Feb-2013 02:45:22]  <Yuna> ((makoto, you're such a chuunibyou)
[14-Feb-2013 02:45:27]  *** Barcode <~chatzilla@dhcp-0-18-e7-f8-27-1.cpe.quickclic.net> has joined #madokamadness

[14-Feb-2013 02:45:34]  <IllFlower> the first thing that draws Makoto's attention is a rather curious-looking dog, whose owner is taking it for a walk.
[14-Feb-2013 02:45:58]  <IllFlower> **
[14-Feb-2013 02:45:59]  *** Barcode <~chatzilla@dhcp-0-18-e7-f8-27-1.cpe.quickclic.net> has left #madokamadness
[14-Feb-2013 02:46:05]  <Sumire> 14no you don't understand
[14-Feb-2013 02:47:00]  <Makoto> "Guys! That dog is a witch!" Makoto yells loudly.
[14-Feb-2013 02:47:32]  <Sumire> "Hahaha, if only it was that easy, Makoto.  If the dog were a witch we'd be inside a giant litterbox or something."
[14-Feb-2013 02:48:04]  * Makoto backs up a little and whispers to Sumire
[14-Feb-2013 02:48:16]  <Makoto> "But it... looks funny... I think it's watching me..."
[14-Feb-2013 02:48:24]  <IllFlower> the dog's owner, an older man who's well through the latter stages of balding, looks at Makoto in the same way one might look at an obtuse piece of modern art.
[14-Feb-2013 02:48:40]  <IllFlower> "um..." he says, seemingly at a loss for words. **
[14-Feb-2013 02:48:47]  * Yuna holds her head in her hands and hides around a corner to a nearby alley, too embarrassed to even be seen near Makoto.
[14-Feb-2013 02:49:04]  <Makoto> ((Well, Makoto /is/ pretty obtuse :V))
[14-Feb-2013 02:49:21]  <Sumire> 14I think to be a piece of modern art she'd have to be transformed, though.
[14-Feb-2013 02:49:48]  <BGTB2005> %C14XD
[14-Feb-2013 02:50:50]  <IllFlower> a bead of sweat drops down the man's forehead. he is clearly not equipped for this encounter.
[14-Feb-2013 02:50:58]  <IllFlower> "is... is something wrong with Satake...?" **
[14-Feb-2013 02:51:18]  <IllFlower> Makoto: roll Sharp again.
[14-Feb-2013 02:51:38]  <Makoto> +roll 2d6+5
[14-Feb-2013 02:51:38]  <rollermine> Makoto: (2+4)+5=11
[14-Feb-2013 02:51:58]  <IllFlower> okay, big fat nothing. keep going with the dog.
[14-Feb-2013 02:52:11]  <IllFlower> Yuna: your turn to roll Sharp.
[14-Feb-2013 02:53:14]  <Yuna> +roll 2d6+7
[14-Feb-2013 02:53:14]  <rollermine> Yuna: (2+4)+7=13
[14-Feb-2013 02:54:39]  <IllFlower> Yuna, sitting around behind a nearby building, starts to feel a weak tug in the direction leading away from the street where Makoto is busy harassing poor Satake. **
[14-Feb-2013 02:55:38]  * Yuna peers out and waves to Sumire, motioning in her direction.
[14-Feb-2013 02:55:49]  <Makoto> "Sir," says Makoto, a grim expression on her face, "I'm afraid your dog is possessed."
[14-Feb-2013 02:55:56]  * Sumire notices Yuna, whispers "It really isn't the dog." to Makoto, and walks away
[14-Feb-2013 02:56:19]  <Makoto> "Ah...? Uhm... beg your pardon sir"
[14-Feb-2013 02:56:23]  * Makoto scuttles away
[14-Feb-2013 02:56:26]  *** JBridge is now known as JBridge|Pancakes
[14-Feb-2013 02:56:53]  <Yuna> "U-um... I think it's over this way..."

[14-Feb-2013 02:57:08]  * Yuna sighs as Makoto comes in closer.
[14-Feb-2013 02:57:40]  <Makoto> "Eheheh... I could have sworn... you gotta admit, that was one funny-looking dog..."
[14-Feb-2013 02:57:41]  *** BGTB2005 <~BGT@pool-96-254-124-236.tampfl.fios.verizon.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Pichuu~n)
[14-Feb-2013 02:57:44]  <IllFlower> the old man, now positively drenched in sweat, watches warily as Sumire and Makoto disappear off behind the adjacent building.
[14-Feb-2013 02:57:50]  *** BGT is now known as BGTB2005
[14-Feb-2013 02:58:03]  <Makoto> ((MAKOTO FUJIWARA. DEFENDER OF JUSTICE.))
[14-Feb-2013 02:58:55]  <IllFlower> "h-h-have a nice day...!" he manages to stutter. the last the girls see of him is his still-petrified figure on the sidewalk.
[14-Feb-2013 02:59:11]  <Yuna> "idiot..."
[14-Feb-2013 02:59:23]  <Sumire> "I hope that man's job doesn't involve teenagers.  We probably gave him a complex."
[14-Feb-2013 03:01:20]  <IllFlower> the alley looks pretty normal, opening up into a small courtyard in the middle of another apartment block before turning into a small pedestrian walk on the other side. **
[14-Feb-2013 03:02:19]  <Sumire> "So, do we head down here?"
[14-Feb-2013 03:02:37]  <Yuna> "I think so... I had, um, a feeling it was this way."
[14-Feb-2013 03:02:49]  <Sumire> "Man, why do I never get these feelings?"
[14-Feb-2013 03:02:53]  * Yuna whispers "and I wanted to get the idiot away from that stupid dog."
[14-Feb-2013 03:03:07]  * Makoto looks very sad
[14-Feb-2013 03:05:41]  <IllFlower> as Yuna points in the direction of the courtyard, Makoto feels another strong tug, incidentally in the exact direction Yuna indicated.
[14-Feb-2013 03:06:13]  <Makoto> "...urp! Uh... yeah, sorry, Yuna... I feel it too now!"
[14-Feb-2013 03:06:44]  <IllFlower> Sumire, for her part, gets distracted by the thought that her magical radar isn't quite up to par, and begins brooding a bit. [;)] **
[14-Feb-2013 03:06:47]  * Makoto looks distinctly queasy
[14-Feb-2013 03:07:13]  <Makoto> "Let's... hurry up and find it guys... this tugging thing ain't really the nicest feeling in the world..."
[14-Feb-2013 03:08:51]  <IllFlower> (note to self: give Makoto an Osaka accent...)
[14-Feb-2013 03:09:13]  <Makoto> ((i was already kind of imagining her with one honestly >_>;))
[14-Feb-2013 03:09:26]  <Yuna> ((me too <.<))
[14-Feb-2013 03:09:52]  <Sumire> 14I'm ont sure if I conscriously was because I'm not 100% sure I can isolate one, but I think I get what's going on
[14-Feb-2013 03:12:21]  <IllFlower> someone's gotta do something about Makoto's tugging feeling...
[14-Feb-2013 03:12:44]  <Makoto> oh was it not being assumed that she was following it? because she is
[14-Feb-2013 03:12:53]  <IllFlower> oh, okay.
[14-Feb-2013 03:13:26]  <Makoto> sorry if that wasn't clear ^_^;
[14-Feb-2013 03:13:40]  <IllFlower> Makoto dashes off again, leaving a tired Yuna and a depressed-looking Sumire behind. **
[14-Feb-2013 03:13:41]  * Sumire follows behind Makoto
[14-Feb-2013 03:16:07]  <IllFlower> Makoto eventually opens up quite the gap between herself and the other two initiates, such that all they can do is follow after her receding figure.
[14-Feb-2013 03:16:48]  <IllFlower> halfway down the walk, Makoto suddenly feels the pull shift from "straight ahead" to "hard right", and disappears down a corner.
[14-Feb-2013 03:16:58]  <IllFlower> Sumire and Yuna can only try to follow behind her. **
[14-Feb-2013 03:18:15]  <Sumire> "...okay, why is Makoto losing us?"
[14-Feb-2013 03:19:49]  <Yuna> I'm slightly tempted to let the witch eat her, but I'm not sure even she deserves that
[14-Feb-2013 03:20:00]  * Yuna speeds up and chases after Makoto.
[14-Feb-2013 03:20:07]  <BGTB2005> 14so cruel
[14-Feb-2013 03:20:21]  <IllFlower> as Makoto begins looking down the next alley, a vision of a brightly-colored aquatic worm of some sort flashes before her, its mouth open wide and ready to strike at --
[14-Feb-2013 03:21:18]  <IllFlower> Makoto crashes into a passer-by, nearly knocking the other person to the ground. **
[14-Feb-2013 03:21:54]  * Makoto lets out a little yelp as she bounces off, crashing to the ground
[14-Feb-2013 03:22:02]  * Makoto hastily stammers apologies
[14-Feb-2013 03:22:08]  <IllFlower> (Yuna, Sumire, you're still behind a corner here. sorry. gotta work on those running stats!)
[14-Feb-2013 03:22:17]  <IllFlower> (meaning, until I say otherwise.)
[14-Feb-2013 03:22:35]  <Sumire> "Do you actually know where Makoto is, Yuna?  I don't want her to face a witch alone..."
[14-Feb-2013 03:23:26]  <IllFlower> the first thing Makoto notices about the person she's just run into is the sheer height.
[14-Feb-2013 03:24:10]  <IllFlower> Makoto's never been good with numbers, but this person is definitely taller than anyone she's ever seen, especially for -- and this is the second thing she notices -- a girl.
[14-Feb-2013 03:25:02]  <IllFlower> the girl looks momentarily shocked for a bit, blinking her eyes as if her brain's stalled, but soon reaches a hand out to Makoto. **
[14-Feb-2013 03:25:42]  <Makoto> Makoto's stream of apologies stops abruptly as she notices the sheer height of the other girl, but she takes the offered hand.
[14-Feb-2013 03:28:09]  <IllFlower> just as the girl is beginning to pull Makoto up from the ground, Yuna and Sumire finally round the corner.
[14-Feb-2013 03:28:16]  <IllFlower> (more)
[14-Feb-2013 03:29:18]  * Nitya 24presses the "continue" button
[14-Feb-2013 03:29:22]  <Nitya> 14wow.
[14-Feb-2013 03:29:51]  <Makoto> (aaah my eyes)
[14-Feb-2013 03:30:09]  <IllFlower> upon seeing the scene, Sumire immediately stops short, as if she's run into a brick wall...
[14-Feb-2013 03:31:24]  <IllFlower> Yuna quickly stops running, turning in surprise to look back at Sumire.
[14-Feb-2013 03:31:36]  <Sumire> 14 so what am I looking at
[14-Feb-2013 03:31:40]  <IllFlower> (more)
[14-Feb-2013 03:33:11]  <IllFlower> Sumire's stopped because the girl is no stranger to her. in fact, she's very familiar...
[14-Feb-2013 03:33:21]  <IllFlower> familiar, even though Sumire had hoped she would never encounter her -- the one girl she'd wished to get away from in the first place -- ever again.
[14-Feb-2013 03:34:25]  <Makoto> ((oh snap))
[14-Feb-2013 03:34:29]  <IllFlower> after all, even now, it's hard to miss Kaede Serizawa, the girl who's always been least a head taller than everyone else.
[14-Feb-2013 03:34:43]  <Nitya> 14are we getting into our actual planned relationships now
[14-Feb-2013 03:34:55]  <IllFlower> Sumire: roll Co, then Ag, separately if you would.

[14-Feb-2013 03:36:45]  <IllFlower> needless to say, Sumire had no expectation of meeting Kaede again -- maybe negative expectation -- and especially not here, doing the very thing she agreed to do in order to leave Kaede behind.
[14-Feb-2013 03:37:17]  <IllFlower> a sharp tug seizes at her heart. not the one of magical pathfinding, no, but one of immediate, visceral fear. **

[14-Feb-2013 03:40:39]  <IllFlower> Kaede looks at Sumire, then Yuna, in utter confusion. **
[14-Feb-2013 03:42:35]  <Yuna> "U-um... I have no idea what's going on either..."
[14-Feb-2013 03:42:41]  * Makoto stares agape at Sumire, who to her eyes just suffered some kind of attack with no provocation whatsoever.
[14-Feb-2013 03:42:55]  <Makoto> "It's... Yuna, this has gotta be it, this time! Don't you think?"
[14-Feb-2013 03:43:00]  * Yuna looks back and forth between Kaede and Sumire, trying to figure out what in the world might be going on
[14-Feb-2013 03:43:05]  <IllFlower> (Sumire, you did roll a total failure to stay calm there, so I'll need you to take effects. you're already doing something humiliating, so that can count as one. I'll additionally ask you to take a point of Overcharge. attribute of your choice.)

[14-Feb-2013 03:44:19]  <IllFlower> Kaede walks over to Sumire, reaching a hand out for her shoulder. **
[14-Feb-2013 03:45:57]  * Yuna stands back a bit, rather intimidated by Kaede's height and not wanting to get any more involved than she has to
[14-Feb-2013 03:46:00]  <IllFlower> "are you all right?" she finally says. "what happened? do you need --" **
[14-Feb-2013 03:46:50]  <Sumire> Sumire freezes up, almost catatonic with Kaede's touch, but manages to spit out one weak line... "you...what are you doing?"

[14-Feb-2013 04:48:14]  <Xeniera> ;;
[14-Feb-2013 04:48:17]  <Sumire> 14then again, it might be like the fanart that did naegi as 0,0junkos
[14-Feb-2013 04:48:23]  * IllFlower jumps up and down in the background, shouting "HEY HEY REMEMBER THE RP THAT WE'RE STILL DOING"
[14-Feb-2013 04:48:45]  <Sumire> 14right
[14-Feb-2013 04:49:18]  <Makoto> ((sorry >__<;0)
[14-Feb-2013 04:49:19]  <Sumire> "But then...she came back...and pretends not to know me at all...I need to talk to Pyunpyun, figure out what's going on."
[14-Feb-2013 04:49:52]  <Makoto> "Where /did/ that little guy get off too...? Hey, wait, where's Yuna?!"
[14-Feb-2013 04:50:57]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun leaps down from a lamppost, where he definitely wasn't just a moment ago. "Yuna... I think I saw her running that way..." he points with his tail down the way the initiates came. **
[14-Feb-2013 04:51:20]  <Sumire> "Pyunpyun, explain yourself!
[14-Feb-2013 04:51:21]  <Sumire> "
[14-Feb-2013 04:52:12]  <IllFlower> "huh? is it something about the witch?" **
[14-Feb-2013 04:52:41]  <Sumire> "There...was no witch.  There was Kaede.  YOU TOLD ME SHE WAS GOING TO BE GONE!"
[14-Feb-2013 04:54:44]  <IllFlower> "whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. slow down. what was there? I told you what?" **
[14-Feb-2013 04:55:24]  <Sumire> "The girl I had you get rid of.  We encountered her looking for this witch of yours."
[14-Feb-2013 04:56:18]  <Fiora> ((dumb guess: kyuubutt got rid of her, in that he removed any memory she had of Sumire and made her stop being a bully.))
[14-Feb-2013 04:56:44]  <Sumire> 14lol, kyuubutt
[14-Feb-2013 04:57:13]  <IllFlower> "'get rid of'? I don't recall being a gang enforcer." **
[14-Feb-2013 04:57:27]  <Saladofstones> ((man my character is going to have a fun time just beign plopped into the middle of this))
[14-Feb-2013 04:58:03]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun is obviously a bit disturbed at Sumire's outburst, and doesn't seem to be processing what Sumire's saying in the least. **

[14-Feb-2013 04:59:36]  <Sumire> 14I see IllFlower's strategy tonight is "play dumb".
[14-Feb-2013 04:59:47]  <IllFlower> there's good reason for it.
[14-Feb-2013 05:00:29]  <Makoto> "Not you too, fuzzbutt! Does /anybody/ know what the hell is going on today?!"

[14-Feb-2013 05:03:59]  <Sumire> "Do you not remember my wish, Pyunpyun?"
[14-Feb-2013 05:05:46]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun looks Sumire in the eyes.
[14-Feb-2013 05:05:52]  <IllFlower> "of course.
[14-Feb-2013 05:06:23]  <IllFlower> "you wanted to cure your mother's illness." **
[14-Feb-2013 05:07:45]  <Sumire> Sumire just stands there, shocked.
[14-Feb-2013 05:08:27]  * Makoto >:?
[14-Feb-2013 05:08:43]  <IllFlower> "chronic lymphocytic leukemia, right?" **

[14-Feb-2013 05:10:15]  <Sumire> "Chronic...what?  My mom never had anything worse than a flu!"
[14-Feb-2013 05:12:45]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun tries to continue in a matter-of-fact tone, but even he can't fully conceal the doubt in his voice. "I remember very clearly you holding your mother's hand in the hospital, saying that you'd be willing o give anything to make her better..." **
[14-Feb-2013 05:13:07]  <Makoto> "...hey. Pyunpyun. What about me? You still remember what /I/ wished for, right?"
[14-Feb-2013 05:13:37]  <Makoto> ((/me burns up on re-entry))
[14-Feb-2013 05:14:11]  <IllFlower> "of course. you wanted to become good at sports... run faster, jump further, kick harder..." **
[14-Feb-2013 05:15:03]  <Makoto> "...y-yeah... that's right... th'heck? What gives, Sumire?"
[14-Feb-2013 05:17:15]  <Makoto> Sumire can all be see the smoke pour out of Makoto's ears as she tries to figure out the latest in a long series of completely confusing events
[14-Feb-2013 05:17:19]  <Makoto> *all but
[14-Feb-2013 05:17:51]  <Sumire> "...I have no idea.  I'm just as confused as you are, Makoto."
[14-Feb-2013 05:18:04]  <Sumire> 14why do I keep wanting to say Mako-chan we're not even using honorifics in this thing
[14-Feb-2013 05:18:25]  <Saladofstones> ((let the honorifics flow through you))
[14-Feb-2013 05:18:29]  <BGTB2005> 14do it
[14-Feb-2013 05:18:35]  <Makoto> ((I just realized I have Makoto call everybody 'chan' all the time XB))

[14-Feb-2013 05:19:52]  <IllFlower> actually, Sumire, you probably should roll Co again to stay calm. >_>
[14-Feb-2013 05:19:57]  <Sumire> +roll 2d6+6
[14-Feb-2013 05:19:58]  <rollermine> Sumire: (3+6)+6=15
[14-Feb-2013 05:20:04]  <Nitya> 14should have expected a god like illflower, Makoto.
[14-Feb-2013 05:20:06]  <Makoto> ((*applause*))
[14-Feb-2013 05:20:19]  <Anonus> I'm not actually watching Madoka right now
[14-Feb-2013 05:20:20]  <Anonus> >_>
[14-Feb-2013 05:20:25]  <Makoto> ((Nobody expects the *shot*))
[14-Feb-2013 05:20:39]  <Sumire> 14wow, lucky hit
[14-Feb-2013 05:20:56]  <IllFlower> pass. Sumire's fine, but obviously she's still not liking this turn of events.
[14-Feb-2013 05:20:59]  <Sumire> 14wait
[14-Feb-2013 05:21:04]  <Sumire> 14shit, my Co's 5, not 6
[14-Feb-2013 05:21:36]  <Sumire> 14re-roll?
[14-Feb-2013 05:21:52]  <IllFlower> yeah, go ahead.
[14-Feb-2013 05:21:57]  <Sumire> +roll 2d6+5

[14-Feb-2013 05:22:23]  <Makoto> ((horns.aiff))
[14-Feb-2013 05:22:46]  <IllFlower> he even got a 6, haha.
[14-Feb-2013 05:23:19]  <Sumire> 14rollermine is a king troll
[14-Feb-2013 05:23:54]  <Sumire> 14so which effect am I taking?
[14-Feb-2013 05:24:08]  <Nitya> 14panic and die instantly
[14-Feb-2013 05:24:23]  <Makoto> 04,01YOU DIED
[14-Feb-2013 05:24:23]  <IllFlower> another point of Overcharge. I take it you'll want it on Mg.
[14-Feb-2013 05:24:45]  <IllFlower> (looking at the other effects and none of them seem to fit too well here...)
[14-Feb-2013 05:24:48]  <Sumire> 14mmhmm
[14-Feb-2013 05:25:24]  <IllFlower> okay, we'll go on with Sumire losing her cool a bit at this unexpected revelation.
[14-Feb-2013 05:25:43]  <IllFlower> not fly-off-the-handle bad. that's for if you had rolled below 12. :p
[14-Feb-2013 05:26:37]  <Sumire> "...it's like...like my life's been ripped out from under me...I don't know whether to trust Pyunpyun's memories or my own."
[14-Feb-2013 05:27:45]  <Makoto> "...okay. Tell ya what we've gotta do. Let's find that witch that's still skulking around someplace, and smash it. Right?"
[14-Feb-2013 05:28:16]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun opens his mouth to speak, but stops as Makoto chips in. **
[14-Feb-2013 05:28:27]  <Sumire> 14Makoto is really excited about this witch-killing business.  I think she might be a McCarthyist.
[14-Feb-2013 05:29:10]  <Makoto> ((Well it's pretty much the only thing she has any idea about, so))
[14-Feb-2013 05:29:30]  <IllFlower> playin' that 7 Ag to the hilt. *the hilt*
[14-Feb-2013 05:31:16]  <Makoto> +roll 2d6+5
[14-Feb-2013 05:31:16]  <rollermine> Makoto: (5+3)+5=13
[14-Feb-2013 05:31:28]  <Makoto> ((that was mostly for my own benefit))
[14-Feb-2013 05:31:28]  <IllFlower> eh?
[14-Feb-2013 05:31:40]  <Sumire> «We can't find any witches, though, considering how useless that «magical tug» thing was...»
[14-Feb-2013 05:32:39]  <IllFlower> Makoto would object, seeing as how she definitely can't say that her internal witch radar wasn't persuasive, but even she can't feel anything now.
[14-Feb-2013 05:32:44]  <Makoto> "Ah, I was hot on its trail! I only stopped 'cause I ran into what's-her-face."
[14-Feb-2013 05:33:05]  <IllFlower> perhaps the witch gave them the slip while they were distracted by Kaede... **
[14-Feb-2013 05:33:11]  <Makoto> "Although... I'm not really picking up anything anymore... guess we all got a little distracted. Least I don't feel like I'm about to puke anymore."
[14-Feb-2013 05:34:18]  <Makoto> "I still can't believe it though. What are the odds of a bunch of freaky stuff like that happening just when we were about to catch it?"
[14-Feb-2013 05:34:50]  <IllFlower> considering what campaign you're in, the answer is "pretty high" :p
[14-Feb-2013 05:35:09]  <Sumire> 14yeah, pretty sure IllFlower and freaky shit belong in the same spot all the time
[14-Feb-2013 05:35:13]  <Makoto> ((shhh! she'll hear you! you'll /spoil the surprise/0)
[14-Feb-2013 05:35:28]  <Makoto> ((also, a pox 'pon my unreliable shift key))
[14-Feb-2013 05:38:07]  <Sumire> "I don't know.  Has anything like this ever occurred, Pyunpyun?"
[14-Feb-2013 05:39:56]  <IllFlower> "memories are volatile things," Pyunpyun says cryptically. "the only thing that's for certain is that it's hard to deny the reality of one's own."

[14-Feb-2013 05:45:40]  <IllFlower> okay, we can move towards wrapping this up, then. we've already gone 45 minutes over our usual 3 hours. o_o
[14-Feb-2013 05:46:12]  <Sumire> 14and without a battle
[14-Feb-2013 05:46:16]  <IllFlower> any objections to just cliffhanging on Pyunpyun's mysterious words?
[14-Feb-2013 05:46:38]  *** MadokaAvenue is now known as CentralAve
[14-Feb-2013 05:46:39]  <IllFlower> who said there was going to be a battle this session? :p
[14-Feb-2013 05:46:50]  <Makoto> ((Well I was thinking of coming up with some excuse to just follow Yuna's lead and retreat for now))
[14-Feb-2013 05:47:03]  <Makoto> ((but retreat don't exactly seem like Makoto's style, now do it?))
[14-Feb-2013 05:48:03]  <Sumire> 14I have no objection to cliffhanging.  will we still get to take off a point of OC, since it doesn't seem like there's a good place to take fallout
[14-Feb-2013 05:48:31]  <IllFlower> yeah, we've covered all the ground I wanted to this session. XP gifting and OC removal as usual.
[14-Feb-2013 05:48:44]  <IllFlower> Fiora as well.
[14-Feb-2013 05:49:03]  <Makoto> okay one point to Sumire I guess
[14-Feb-2013 05:49:26]  <Sumire> one to Makoto for almost punching Kaede
[14-Feb-2013 05:49:28]  <Yuna> ((um, I hardly did anything... I just kind of ran off, does that count as a session))
[14-Feb-2013 05:49:33]  <Makoto> because everything's made up and the points don't matter
[14-Feb-2013 05:50:18]  <IllFlower> Yuna: you can still gift 1 XP.
[14-Feb-2013 05:50:38]  <Yuna> ((um, okay.  sumire.))
[14-Feb-2013 05:51:14]  <Sumire> 14do the XP have any use though, since we're just doing an advance per round
[14-Feb-2013 05:51:20]  <Sumire> 14er, per arc
[14-Feb-2013 05:51:54]  <Makoto> presumably they are for IllFlower's mysterious and inscrutable purposes.
[14-Feb-2013 05:52:20]  <IllFlower> I'm using them for bookkeeping purposes at the very least. I might award extra Advances to people with unusual amounts of XP.
[14-Feb-2013 05:52:49]  <IllFlower> anyway, that's curtains for tonight. we'll pick up on Sunday. thanks for playing, everyone.
