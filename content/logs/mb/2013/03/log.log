@time=2013-01-17T05:03:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :meanwhile, time to handle Corruption. there's no new trinket this time. Aoi took 4, Yuna took 5, and Sumire took 7, but has a Despair Diadem from the last battle with 5 charges remaining on it.
@time=2013-01-17T05:04:20.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'll remove 3 Corruption from myself, and one from Yuna and Aoi each.

@time=2013-01-17T05:04:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so 3/4/4 for you guys.
@time=2013-01-17T05:06:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :and noted. now you'll want to figure out where to go. the initiates probably don't want to be in the basement forever, and there is that door on the other side of the room...

@time=2013-01-17T05:07:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the door opens to reveal... a floor.
@time=2013-01-17T05:08:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sumire peeks her head around the opening, and notes that they're apparently standing sideways, holding open a door that leads into the ceiling of the cafeteria.
@time=2013-01-17T05:08:30.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14is it green

@time=2013-01-17T05:15:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Aoi goes in through the door first, trying to use his dance moves to slow the fall, but instead he trips and goes somersaulting headlong into a (fortunately, empty) table.
@time=2013-01-17T05:17:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sumire's landing is only slightly less awkward, but at least she lands on her feet. sort of. she gets one foot on the table, then one foot on the ground, and her unbalanced self falls into a passerby.
@time=2013-01-17T05:17:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yuna's the only one who manages to make it down without incident.

@time=2013-01-17T05:22:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sumire's got her own mess to clean up. might want to attend to the curry puddle she's sitting in first...

@time=2013-01-17T05:23:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I don't think napkins are going to be enough..." the boy Sumire fell into says, rubbing his head.

@time=2013-01-17T05:24:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Aoi's friend from earlier (his name is Sakamoto, by-the-by) walks over to him, with a look of some disbelief on his face.

@time=2013-01-17T05:25:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :problem solved.
@time=2013-01-17T05:26:27.000Z :Aoi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Nice trick, don't you think?  And nah, it's no big deal.  Can I get some of those napkins, Sumire?"
@time=2013-01-17T05:26:43.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"They're kind of covered in curry, but you can have them if you want."

@time=2013-01-17T05:29:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :soon enough, Yuna shows up with one of the cafeteria staff. the hairnetted woman doesn't look happy, but since she has no idea what happened and can't find anyone to blame for the mess, she just asks everyone to clear out in an irritated, slightly confused voice.
@time=2013-01-17T05:29:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"seriously, what a waste of perfectly good curry..." she mutters under her beath. **
@time=2013-01-17T05:33:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well, in the end, the school at least had something to talk about for a little while, other than the disappeared students. Sumire manages to grab a spare uniform, and the three initiates rush to grab a bite while Aoi tries to keep his nose plugged. Sakamoto does eventually drag him off to the infirmary, over his protests.
@time=2013-01-17T05:33:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I have a feeling he'll be getting an earful from Rie (his girlfriend) about those little improvised dance performances...

@time=2013-01-17T05:34:10.000Z :Aoi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Naw, man.  She digs the improvised dances.  Eh, eh?
@time=2013-01-17T05:34:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :last thing: everyone assign their gift XP.

@time=2013-01-17T05:35:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :you all get one additional XP for participating. sadly, no witch this episode (which series composer decided to put the comic relief here?!), so no XP for that.
@time=2013-01-17T05:36:42.000Z :Sumire PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I think I have to give mine to Yuna, for being all responsible and shit.
@time=2013-01-17T05:38:10.000Z :Yuna PRIVMSG #madokamadness :U-um... I'll give one to Sumire, as thanks for keeping around that grief seed.
@time=2013-01-17T05:38:15.000Z :Yuna PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And sharing it
@time=2013-01-17T05:39:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :okay, so that's 3 for Yuna, 2 for Sumire, 1 for Aoi.
