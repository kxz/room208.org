[17-Jan-2013 02:08:46]  <IllFlower> okay, we'll go ahead and get started, then.
[17-Jan-2013 02:09:53]  <IllFlower> it's early in the morning, too early in the morning, and all of you are sliding into your desks at school.

[17-Jan-2013 02:11:12]  <IllFlower> with the fourth disappearance of a student fresh on everyone's minds, the rumor mill is working its second shift of overtime.
[17-Jan-2013 02:11:47]  <Sumire> "Another disappearance?  Do you think Pyunpyun will try to get us involved or something?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:12:35]  <IllFlower> all of the gossip seems to have coalesced into one persistent whisper hissing the name "Tadashi Irie" down the hallways and into the classrooms.
[17-Jan-2013 02:12:40]  <Yuna> "He really didn't seem the type to care that much... unless maybe it has to do with a witch?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:12:55]  <IllFlower> and keep going with that conversation for now. **
[17-Jan-2013 02:13:58]  <Aoi> "I'm going to failed that test... agh..."
[17-Jan-2013 02:14:00]  <Sumire> "I kind of doubt he actually knows that much about the witches.  I mean, he disappears every time before we fight them, as if he's even more scared than we are."
[17-Jan-2013 02:14:29]  <Sumire> "And come on, Aoi, it couldn't be that bad."
[17-Jan-2013 02:15:09]  <Yuna> "It does seem like a weird coincidence though... I mean, we all became magical girls pretty recently, right?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:16:13]  * Aoi glares sullenly at Yuna before resuming glaring sullenly at his desk.
[17-Jan-2013 02:17:02]  <Yuna> "S-sorry... I know you're upset about that test... j-just because I did well doesn't mean it's my fault you didn't!"
[17-Jan-2013 02:17:23]  <Yuna> ((yes I know ooc what aoi is referring to, I'm intentionally missing it))
[17-Jan-2013 02:18:30]  <IllFlower> a male classmate trundles up to Aoi's desk, breaking up the repartee. "yo, Iwatani, what you looking so down for? your girlfriend make fun of your dancing again or something?" **
[17-Jan-2013 02:19:07]  * Yuna whispers to Sumire.  "ooh, he has a girlfriend?  do you know who it is?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:19:09]  <Aoi> "Heh, yeah, right.  She's the one stuck playing trombone."
[17-Jan-2013 02:19:55]  <IllFlower> Aoi: "yeah, as if you don't fantasize about *that* already." **
[17-Jan-2013 02:19:58]  * Sumire whispers back to Yuna.  "I can't remember her name, but I've met her a few times.  She seems okay enough"
[17-Jan-2013 02:20:14]  <Aoi> "It's just this math stuff.  I don't get it, man.  How do you have numbers and letters?  It's crazy."
[17-Jan-2013 02:21:02]  <Aoi> "Fantasize about... oh, haha."
[17-Jan-2013 02:21:04]  * Aoi stretches
[17-Jan-2013 02:21:25]  * Yuna giggles. "What, not enough room in that little head for both of those?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:21:47]  <Aoi> "Aren't you supposed to say I'm big-headed?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:21:58]  <Aoi> "Anyway, you need something, dude?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:22:03]  <Sumire> Hey now, haven't you ever gotten sidetracked by a hot .... boy, Yuna?
[17-Jan-2013 02:22:42]  <IllFlower> Aoi: "I was gonna say, we got more important things to talk about than math. what do you think about this Irie thing?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:24:15]  <Aoi> "I haven't heard much, but... it's not that crazy to think she got swallowed up b... by, you know, whatever.  All those other girls did."
[17-Jan-2013 02:24:37]  * Aoi attempts to not glance meaningfully at sumire and yuna
[17-Jan-2013 02:24:57]  <Yuna> "S-swallowed?"  That sounds scary...
[17-Jan-2013 02:24:59]  * Sumire glances at Yuna meaningfully though
[17-Jan-2013 02:25:00]  <IllFlower> "Irie's a guy, man. the first."
[17-Jan-2013 02:25:07]  <Yuna> *"S-swallowed?  That sounds scary..."
[17-Jan-2013 02:25:18]  <Aoi> "What.  What?  Really?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:25:34]  <Aoi> 14I hope you didn't expect me to know that was a male name, if it is.
[17-Jan-2013 02:25:45]  <Sumire> "Oh, don't worry about it!  They probably just got kidnapped by someone who plans on reappearing later and extorting tons of ransom!"
[17-Jan-2013 02:25:55]  <Sumire> 14Well, "Irie" is the family name, I think?
[17-Jan-2013 02:26:14]  <Aoi> 14Prseumably Aoi has been hearing the rumors about "Tadashi Irie".
[17-Jan-2013 02:26:14]  <Yuna> "That still sounds pretty scary, Sumire..."
[17-Jan-2013 02:26:28]  * Aoi gives Sumire a Look
[17-Jan-2013 02:26:35]  <IllFlower> Aoi: "how have you not heard of him? he's on the baseball team. you know, the one that just won the championship? of course people are freaking out."
[17-Jan-2013 02:26:45]  <Sumire> "We have a baseball team?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:26:49]  <Aoi> "So is he actually m-"
[17-Jan-2013 02:26:55]  * Aoi gives Sumire a Look
[17-Jan-2013 02:27:19]  <Aoi> "Is he actually missing?  We know he's not just behind the bleachers smoking?"
[17-Jan-2013 02:27:36]  <Aoi> "And hey, I'm not into sports much, that's all.  Way dirty."
[17-Jan-2013 02:27:36]  <Sumire> "Sorry, I'll shut up now."
[17-Jan-2013 02:27:41]  <Aoi> 14Dinner.  Bye
[17-Jan-2013 02:28:12]  <Yuna> ((I should come home from work sometime soon; would it be convenient if I did it now while he eats?))
[17-Jan-2013 02:28:23]  <IllFlower> yeah, go ahead.

[17-Jan-2013 03:01:12]  <Yuna> ((I already said so :P))
[17-Jan-2013 03:01:26]  <IllFlower> to recap:
[17-Jan-2013 03:01:30]  <Aoi> 14that was RP. I am ahead of the curve.
[17-Jan-2013 03:01:47]  <IllFlower> "there's a pattern, Iwatani. I read the evening edition last night, and the police said they still hadn't found any connection, but we all know that's total garbage. Shinagawa and Itou, the first two? they were best friends. now Irie's gone. Irie was dating Shinagawa. doesn't get any more connected than that."
[17-Jan-2013 03:01:54]  <IllFlower> Aoi's acquaintance leans in, whispering to the three initiates. "you know what I'd guess, though? Irie's a popular guy. he's a baseball ace, and he's not bad-looking either. I bet he was seeing a bunch of girls at the same time. one of them found out, and she wasn't happy... well, you know what goes next." **
[17-Jan-2013 03:02:23]  <Sumire> "So you think they were all killed by another woman?"
[17-Jan-2013 03:03:05]  <IllFlower> "hey, makes as much sense as the next theory, right?"
[17-Jan-2013 03:03:25]  <Sumire> "I guess it makes sense, but something about it just seems off..."
[17-Jan-2013 03:03:54]  <IllFlower> just as the question leaves his mouth, the homeroom teacher walks in. Aoi's friend clicks his tongue and heads back to his desk.
[17-Jan-2013 03:04:43]  <IllFlower> there's some time left for chatter amongst the three initiates themselves, though, as the teacher goes through the usual start-of-class formalities. **
[17-Jan-2013 03:06:25]  <Aoi> "Irie'd have to be a real ass to do that, but... why would a witch care?"
[17-Jan-2013 03:06:43]  <Yuna> "Wait... what if... okay this is a long shot, but... what if all the people who disappeared where magical girls or boys?"
[17-Jan-2013 03:06:46]  <Yuna> "And like, they got defeated?"
[17-Jan-2013 03:06:47]  <Sumire> "Might be some sort of twisted divine justice thing."
[17-Jan-2013 03:07:23]  <Aoi> "Yuna, does that.. wait, nevermind.  We could ask Pyunpyun though."
[17-Jan-2013 03:07:55]  <Sumire> "I remember watching some episode of a TV show where the villain was this demon whose main purpose was to punish cheating men.  I think she usually did more interesting things than just disappear them, though."
[17-Jan-2013 03:08:10]  <Yuna> "And that doesn't make sense since the first three were girls..."
[17-Jan-2013 03:08:41]  <Sumire> "It could be an equal-opportunity demon?"
[17-Jan-2013 03:09:28]  <IllFlower> aside from all this, Yuna's heard that there were multiple sightings of a girl, or maybe several different girls, in the school's uniform, wandering the streets at night, since the disappearances started.
[17-Jan-2013 03:09:41]  <IllFlower> discuss. **

[17-Jan-2013 03:10:43]  <Yuna> "... thinking about that, the magical girl theory really does make sense... I remember hearing some rumors of some girls wandering around the streets in the middle of the night in their uniforms."
[17-Jan-2013 03:11:19]  <Sumire> "Are you sure those rumors weren't about us?"
[17-Jan-2013 03:11:20]  * Yuna glances around.  "Though, Sumire, I hope that wasn't /us/ that people spotted."
[17-Jan-2013 03:11:30]  <IllFlower> (and Yuna's speculation is... well, if not on the right track, at least in the right railyard. not that she herself would know!)
[17-Jan-2013 03:12:23]  <Yuna> "But we definitely know there's at least some other magical girls around this area..."
[17-Jan-2013 03:12:29]  <Aoi> 14sorry, helping brother
[17-Jan-2013 03:12:40]  * Yuna thinks back to making her contract and the vision burned into her memory of that one girl running away in terror.
[17-Jan-2013 03:13:02]  <Sumire> 14we can say you're actually trying to pay attention in class
[17-Jan-2013 03:13:09]  <Aoi> 14haha
[17-Jan-2013 03:13:26]  <Sumire> "...you okay, Yuna?"
[17-Jan-2013 03:14:00]  <Yuna> "U-um... I'm fine!"
[17-Jan-2013 03:14:07]  <IllFlower> "hey..." the girl sitting in front of Yuna leans her chair back, seemingly speaking to the ceiling above her.
[17-Jan-2013 03:16:03]  * Aoi has been actually listening to the teacher.  He needs that C, and doesn't actually care too much to hear witches have victims.  But he at least notes this.
[17-Jan-2013 03:17:01]  <IllFlower> "speaking of that, I heard from Wakana... you know, her dad's a police officer, right? he said the number of reported street crimes had been down lately, before this happened...
[17-Jan-2013 03:17:19]  <IllFlower> "I wonder if that has something to do with why those girls are prowling around now..." **
[17-Jan-2013 03:19:14]  <Sumire> "Well, there was that one guy who seemed like he was on drugs.  Maybe there is a connection."
[17-Jan-2013 03:19:40]  <IllFlower> "drugs?"
[17-Jan-2013 03:20:13]  <Sumire> "A-aa-u-um...it's a long story.  Maybe Yuna could explain?"
[17-Jan-2013 03:20:55]  <Aoi> "What have you two been doing..."
[17-Jan-2013 03:22:05]  * Yuna tries to act like she's paying attention to the teacher and doesn't hear the other two.
[17-Jan-2013 03:22:26]  <Sumire> "I haven't been doing anything at all, no way, no sirree bob!"
[17-Jan-2013 03:23:23]  <IllFlower> after a few minutes, the homeroom teacher finally finishes up with the usual stand-bow routine, and the first period teacher walks in. looks like you all have to actually start paying attention. **
[17-Jan-2013 03:25:54]  <Yuna> (wait if we're paying attention to the teacher what do we do)
[17-Jan-2013 03:26:13]  <IllFlower> fast-forward to lunch. it's usual for students here to eat in the cafeteria even if they've brought their own food, so Aoi, Sumire, and Yuna leisurely make their way downstairs from the classroom.

[17-Jan-2013 04:23:26]  * Sumire begins the fight by using the portal to quickly move right behind one of the statues.  At point blank range, she pulls out her wand, and yells "SHATTER!"  The statue transforms from outside in to glass, shattering.
[17-Jan-2013 04:23:39]  <IllFlower> impressive.
[17-Jan-2013 04:23:53]  <Aoi> 14Aoi has learned from Miaka's RIP AND TEARING, and elects to open fire

[17-Jan-2013 04:27:50]  <IllFlower> that's two successes. (opponent can't take Overcharge, so no "m".)
[17-Jan-2013 04:28:19]  <Yuna> ((I could magic shield him, right?))
[17-Jan-2013 04:28:25]  <Sumire> 14I think you could, yeah.
[17-Jan-2013 04:28:42]  <IllFlower> either of you two can Clash or Cover or use Magic Shield or whatever.
[17-Jan-2013 04:28:48]  <IllFlower> it takes up your turn, however.
[17-Jan-2013 04:28:56]  <Aoi> 14but i just moved...
[17-Jan-2013 04:28:56]  <Sumire> 14I thought Aoi already moved.
[17-Jan-2013 04:29:05]  <IllFlower> oh, just Yuna then, sorry.
[17-Jan-2013 04:30:28]  * Yuna yells "Aoi!", waving her flashlight to flash a shield in front of him.
[17-Jan-2013 04:30:37]  * Yuna takes one Fury overcharge.

[17-Jan-2013 04:30:59]  <IllFlower> lol.
[17-Jan-2013 04:31:26]  <IllFlower> okay, that effectively deflects one attack, but the other still hits.
[17-Jan-2013 04:31:52]  <IllFlower> two of the busts rise into the air slightly, and begin circling Sumire.
[17-Jan-2013 04:32:25]  <IllFlower> out of nowhere, the two of them stop, and then immediately rush at her.
[17-Jan-2013 04:32:59]  <IllFlower> Yuna manages to throw her flashlight beam onto Sumire in time to deflect one of the statues, but the other one slams into Sumire's body, knocking her to the ground.

[17-Jan-2013 04:34:02]  <IllFlower> Yuna used her turn, so it's time for the other two statues to attack.
[17-Jan-2013 04:34:11]  <Aoi> 14gee, i think we're overestimating them (slash underestimating their later destroying us to death)
[17-Jan-2013 04:34:20]  <IllFlower> they're drawn by the flashlight, and decide to attack her. roll for defense.

[17-Jan-2013 04:36:03]  <IllFlower> 22. both attacks fail.
[17-Jan-2013 04:36:28]  <IllFlower> you can describe how you avoid the statues' attacks.
[17-Jan-2013 04:36:40]  <Barcode> ((same diving-ram thing, right?))
[17-Jan-2013 04:36:42]  <IllFlower> meanwhile, the next round starts. anyone want to change attributes?
[17-Jan-2013 04:36:51]  <Sumire> 14I'm good
[17-Jan-2013 04:36:52]  <IllFlower> yeah, you can assume it's the same attack.
[17-Jan-2013 04:37:28]  * Yuna jumps to the side and gracefully dodges the two attacking statues, the wind from their dives blowing her hair and dress dramatically.
[17-Jan-2013 04:37:38]  <IllFlower> hahaha.
[17-Jan-2013 04:37:48]  <IllFlower> she's got *style*.

[17-Jan-2013 04:39:38]  <IllFlower> his score card says "arctan π/4"
[17-Jan-2013 04:40:00]  * Yuna glances at the others as she finishes her dodge and winks.
[17-Jan-2013 04:40:05]  <Sumire> 14ew, that'd be a nasty probably-transcendental number
[17-Jan-2013 04:40:23]  <IllFlower> Yuna: changing attribute order this round?

[17-Jan-2013 04:41:32]  <IllFlower> okay, Sumire goes first again.
[17-Jan-2013 04:41:50]  * Aoi is somewhat put back on balance by the incredible cheesiness of the wink.
[17-Jan-2013 04:41:50]  * Sumire attacks again

[17-Jan-2013 04:44:11]  <IllFlower> Sumire: no way any of the statues have a chance against that. you destroy one of them. you also take 2 Magic Overcharge.

[17-Jan-2013 04:45:50]  <Sumire> Sumire swirls around, hopped up on irritation or coffee or something.  "COLLAPSING...WINDOW...STRIKE!" she screams out.  What appear to be pieces of broken glass fly in all directions, although they manage to miss everything except one of the statues, which explodes dramatically.
[17-Jan-2013 04:46:08]  <Barcode> ((heh))
[17-Jan-2013 04:46:08]  <Aoi> 14who wins a tie...
[17-Jan-2013 04:46:35]  <IllFlower> Aoi has the higher base attribute (8 vs. 6), so he wins. the attack's a success.
[17-Jan-2013 04:46:42]  <IllFlower> you destroy one of the statues.

[17-Jan-2013 04:49:01]  * Aoi fires again and this time strikes true, boring an icy hole through the grinning visage of some dead aristocrat.  The statue then freezes and refreezes rapidly enough to destroy it, in a display Aoi's geology teacher would be proud of.
[17-Jan-2013 04:49:15]  <IllFlower> life is so much easier now that I have a spreadsheet for battle statistics, sortable by initiative. I am a genius.

[17-Jan-2013 04:50:08]  <Sumire> 14you could, but you already have two
[17-Jan-2013 04:50:11]  <IllFlower> you... could...

[17-Jan-2013 04:50:14]  <Aoi> 14I was thinking of having the statue turn into that bust of Lenin at the Antarctic pole of inaccessibility, but I figure that's a bit silly.
[17-Jan-2013 04:50:24]  <IllFlower> she has no Heart overcharge, and that's her attack attribute.

[17-Jan-2013 04:57:34]  <BGTB2005> 14I just decided to pay attention to the 'distribute the pain equally' comment; is it a statue of Lenin?
[17-Jan-2013 04:57:40]  <IllFlower> the statue tries to pull a new trick out of its bag, and fires eye beams at Aoi. it misses hideously.

[17-Jan-2013 04:58:51]  <Sumire> 14Also, I feel like I saw statues with eye beams in one of the Red Alert games.
[17-Jan-2013 04:58:57]  <Aoi> 14«"no"»

[17-Jan-2013 04:59:15]  <IllFlower> Sumire goes first again, then.
[17-Jan-2013 04:59:21]  <Sumire> "Yeah, Yuna, it does sort of seem like it.  Or maybe I was just thrown off-guard.
[17-Jan-2013 04:59:32]  * Sumire attacks the final statue

[17-Jan-2013 04:59:41]  <IllFlower> bloody hell, man
[17-Jan-2013 05:00:01]  <IllFlower> statue goes "poof" into a million little pieces.
[17-Jan-2013 05:00:40]  <Sumire> 14...well, I guess we'll learn how to deal with fallout ._.
[17-Jan-2013 05:01:18]  <IllFlower> the battle's over. now you get to figure out Fallout. page 18.
[17-Jan-2013 05:01:35]  <IllFlower> nobody has to take any except Sumire, who has 3 on Magic.
[17-Jan-2013 05:01:53]  <Sumire> "A distortion that removes 3 points of Overcharge causes something impossible to happen, but something that people can 
[17-Jan-2013 05:01:56]  <Sumire> dismiss as imagined"
[17-Jan-2013 05:02:09]  * Aoi 14what, down here in the frickin basement?
[17-Jan-2013 05:02:16]  <Aoi> 14why did i /me that
[17-Jan-2013 05:02:19]  <IllFlower> I've got something, actually.
[17-Jan-2013 05:02:32]  <Aoi> 14"oh boy"
[17-Jan-2013 05:02:35]  <Sumire> 14that's good, because I don't
[17-Jan-2013 05:03:40]  <IllFlower> meanwhile, time to handle Corruption. there's no new trinket this time. Aoi took 4, Yuna took 5, and Sumire took 7, but has a Despair Diadem from the last battle with 5 charges remaining on it.
[17-Jan-2013 05:04:20]  <Sumire> I'll remove 3 Corruption from myself, and one from Yuna and Aoi each.
[17-Jan-2013 05:04:29]  <Yuna> (Sounds good.)
[17-Jan-2013 05:04:40]  <IllFlower> so 3/4/4 for you guys.
[17-Jan-2013 05:06:04]  <IllFlower> and noted. now you'll want to figure out where to go. the initiates probably don't want to be in the basement forever, and there is that door on the other side of the room...
[17-Jan-2013 05:06:05]  <Aoi> 14i am the only pure one!  YOU ALL MUST BURN
[17-Jan-2013 05:06:51]  <Sumire> "Should we try the other door?  I feel like that might be a quicker way out of this weird place than trying to climb however many flights of stairs that was..."
[17-Jan-2013 05:07:26]  <Aoi> "I guess so."
[17-Jan-2013 05:07:32]  <Yuna> "I hope there isn't a witch around here, but, gosh, I'm a bit curious."
[17-Jan-2013 05:07:37]  * Sumire runs to other door, opens it
[17-Jan-2013 05:07:43]  <Yuna> "... and honestly, I'm feeling kind of good after that.  That was fun!"
[17-Jan-2013 05:07:55]  <IllFlower> the door opens to reveal... a floor.
[17-Jan-2013 05:08:29]  <IllFlower> Sumire peeks her head around the opening, and notes that they're apparently standing sideways, holding open a door that leads into the ceiling of the cafeteria.
[17-Jan-2013 05:08:30]  <BGTB2005> 14is it green
[17-Jan-2013 05:08:51]  <Aoi> "...I guess that's convenient."
[17-Jan-2013 05:08:57]  <IllFlower> there's your distortion! have fun working that out.
[17-Jan-2013 05:09:17]  <Sumire> "...Apparently this door leads into the ceiling.  Allons-y, I guess!"
[17-Jan-2013 05:10:02]  <IllFlower> the ceiling *is* about three meters off the ground. might want to be careful.
[17-Jan-2013 05:10:47]  * Aoi 's a dancer and shit, he's got this.
[17-Jan-2013 05:11:17]  * Aoi walks through
[17-Jan-2013 05:11:22]  * Yuna peers in.   ((Is anyone inside?))
[17-Jan-2013 05:11:26]  * Sumire peers into the cafeteria, aims for a table to reduce the length of her fall, and gently raises/lowers her legs into the changing gravity.
[17-Jan-2013 05:11:52]  <Aoi> 14gosh, planning.  you people.
[17-Jan-2013 05:12:28]  <IllFlower> Yuna: of course. it's full of people eating lunch.
[17-Jan-2013 05:12:59]  <Yuna> "Um, you guys, can't we wait until after lunch is..."
[17-Jan-2013 05:13:21]  <Aoi> 14Sure is taking a long time for Aoi to be reckless!  Jerks
[17-Jan-2013 05:13:26]  * Yuna 's voice trails off as Aoi just climbs in
[17-Jan-2013 05:13:57]  <IllFlower> Cool check, everyone.
[17-Jan-2013 05:14:05]  <IllFlower> 2d6+Co.

[17-Jan-2013 05:14:42]  <Aoi> Goddammit.
[17-Jan-2013 05:14:56]  <IllFlower> lololololol.
[17-Jan-2013 05:15:10]  <Yuna> +roll 2d6+6
[17-Jan-2013 05:15:11]  <rollermine> Yuna: (3+6)+6=15
[17-Jan-2013 05:15:29]  <Sumire> 14now do we choose which effect or do you?
[17-Jan-2013 05:15:44]  <IllFlower> Aoi goes in through the door first, trying to use his dance moves to slow the fall, but instead he trips and goes somersaulting headlong into a (fortunately, empty) table.
[17-Jan-2013 05:17:02]  <IllFlower> Sumire's landing is only slightly less awkward, but at least she lands on her feet. sort of. she gets one foot on the table, then one foot on the ground, and her unbalanced self falls into a passerby.
[17-Jan-2013 05:17:14]  <IllFlower> Yuna's the only one who manages to make it down without incident.
[17-Jan-2013 05:18:21]  <IllFlower> +roll d6 >! as a formality, Aoi loses some Resolve, but it doesn't matter as this scene is basically over...
[17-Jan-2013 05:18:22]  <rollermine> 1=1
[17-Jan-2013 05:20:22]  <IllFlower> of course, there's a commotion as Aoi crashes into the table, and Sumire knocks over a tray full of today's Lunch Special A, but nobody seems to have noticed that they came out of the *ceiling*, at least.
[17-Jan-2013 05:20:26]  <IllFlower> **
[17-Jan-2013 05:21:09]  <Aoi> "Owowow..."
[17-Jan-2013 05:21:25]  <Yuna> "Aoi...!"
[17-Jan-2013 05:21:28]  * Yuna sighs
[17-Jan-2013 05:21:30]  *** Alicia <Mibbit@c-98-199-217-5.hsd1.tx.comcast.net> has left #madokamadness
[17-Jan-2013 05:21:46]  <Sumire> "Aoi, are you okay?"
[17-Jan-2013 05:22:15]  <IllFlower> Sumire's got her own mess to clean up. might want to attend to the curry puddle she's sitting in first...
[17-Jan-2013 05:22:36]  <Sumire> "Oh, oh, oh, I'm so sorry about that.  Um, where are some napkins?"
[17-Jan-2013 05:23:04]  * Yuna steps away quickly to go get a cafeteria person
[17-Jan-2013 05:23:11]  <IllFlower> "I don't think napkins are going to be enough..." the boy Sumire fell into says, rubbing his head.
[17-Jan-2013 05:23:27]  <Aoi> "Uf.  It'd better be pizza day."
[17-Jan-2013 05:24:16]  <IllFlower> Aoi's friend from earlier (his name is Sakamoto, by-the-by) walks over to him, with a look of some disbelief on his face.
[17-Jan-2013 05:25:08]  <IllFlower> "Iwatani, what are you doing on the table? did you do something to Shirayuki? ... oh, no, hold on, your nose is bleeding! we should get you to the infirmary!" **
[17-Jan-2013 05:25:09]  * Aoi casually stretches, then hops off the table with a fluorish
[17-Jan-2013 05:25:29]  <Aoi> 14or not?
[17-Jan-2013 05:25:50]  <Aoi> 14gosh, can't a guy be injured without losing motor capability..
[17-Jan-2013 05:25:53]  <IllFlower> s/what are you/what were you/
[17-Jan-2013 05:25:56]  <IllFlower> problem solved.
[17-Jan-2013 05:26:27]  <Aoi> "Nice trick, don't you think?  And nah, it's no big deal.  Can I get some of those napkins, Sumire?"
[17-Jan-2013 05:26:43]  <Sumire> "They're kind of covered in curry, but you can have them if you want."
[17-Jan-2013 05:28:00]  * Yuna comes back with someone to help clean up the mess?
[17-Jan-2013 05:28:14]  <Aoi> "mm, I think I'll pass.  Rather get that from a bowl..."
[17-Jan-2013 05:29:06]  <IllFlower> soon enough, Yuna shows up with one of the cafeteria staff. the hairnetted woman doesn't look happy, but since she has no idea what happened and can't find anyone to blame for the mess, she just asks everyone to clear out in an irritated, slightly confused voice.
[17-Jan-2013 05:29:46]  <IllFlower> "seriously, what a waste of perfectly good curry..." she mutters under her beath. **
[17-Jan-2013 05:33:13]  <IllFlower> well, in the end, the school at least had something to talk about for a little while, other than the disappeared students. Sumire manages to grab a spare uniform, and the three initiates rush to grab a bite while Aoi tries to keep his nose plugged. Sakamoto does eventually drag him off to the infirmary, over his protests.
[17-Jan-2013 05:33:47]  <IllFlower> I have a feeling he'll be getting an earful from Rie (his girlfriend) about those little improvised dance performances...
[17-Jan-2013 05:33:50]  <Aoi> "Geez, it was just a flip."
[17-Jan-2013 05:34:10]  <Aoi> Naw, man.  She digs the improvised dances.  Eh, eh?
[17-Jan-2013 05:34:29]  <IllFlower> last thing: everyone assign their gift XP.
[17-Jan-2013 05:34:57]  <Aoi> yuna, for being all responsible 'n' shit
[17-Jan-2013 05:35:43]  <IllFlower> you all get one additional XP for participating. sadly, no witch this episode (which series composer decided to put the comic relief here?!), so no XP for that.
[17-Jan-2013 05:36:42]  <Sumire> Yeah, I think I have to give mine to Yuna, for being all responsible and shit.
[17-Jan-2013 05:38:10]  <Yuna> U-um... I'll give one to Sumire, as thanks for keeping around that grief seed.
[17-Jan-2013 05:38:15]  <Yuna> And sharing it
[17-Jan-2013 05:39:10]  <IllFlower> okay, so that's 3 for Yuna, 2 for Sumire, 1 for Aoi.
[17-Jan-2013 05:39:38]  <Aoi> woe!
[17-Jan-2013 05:39:52]  <IllFlower> all right, everyone, that wraps up this episode! thanks for playing.
