[02-Jul-2013 01:41:20]  <IllFlower> Okay, then we'll resume where we left off last session, with Yui, Sumire, and Snezana at Yuna's front door.
[02-Jul-2013 01:41:43]  <Snezana> ((also the revolver i took from the cop is going to be a mp-412_rex, because I really like that gun and fuck japanese gun laws)
[02-Jul-2013 01:42:06]  <Sumire> 14itt: urobuchi-style gun porn
[02-Jul-2013 01:42:18]  <Snezana> I figure I'm basically Kerry at this point
[02-Jul-2013 01:42:30]  <IllFlower> The three visiting initiates have spent their time speculating about what exactly Hiroaki is up to, although they haven't come to much of a conclusion either way.
[02-Jul-2013 01:42:41]  <Yuna> ((I'm ready to ruin everything))
[02-Jul-2013 01:42:48]  <IllFlower> So, who'll do the honors of ringing the bell? **
[02-Jul-2013 01:42:51]  <Snezana> ((don't worry, you have me for that)0
[02-Jul-2013 01:43:03]  <Sumire> 14hahaha, I think we all think we're the worst roleplayer here
[02-Jul-2013 01:43:06]  * Snezana knocks on the door
[02-Jul-2013 01:43:44]  * Snezana turns around to the other initiates, resting her back against the door
[02-Jul-2013 01:43:53]  <Yui> ((I like how nemo said ring the bell and you knocked))
[02-Jul-2013 01:44:04]  <Yui> ((:P))
[02-Jul-2013 01:44:09]  <Snezana> "I still think you're giving Hiro way too much credit Yui"
[02-Jul-2013 01:44:29]  <Snezana> "I mean, we have what happens to Sumire -just- right outside where he lives?
[02-Jul-2013 01:44:39]  <Snezana> ((oh wait I don't know that do I))
[02-Jul-2013 01:44:50]  <Sumire> 14eh, it can be replaced
[02-Jul-2013 01:44:57]  * Yuna peers out nervously through the little hole in the door
[02-Jul-2013 01:44:59]  <Sumire> 14with "and then he -just- suddenly apperars?"
[02-Jul-2013 01:45:04]  <Snezana> yeah
[02-Jul-2013 01:45:19]  <Sumire> "I don't know if he's responsible.  I mean, another glass-element initiate?  That'd be a weird coincidence."
[02-Jul-2013 01:45:21]  * Yuna opens up the door a crack, only to have Snezana fall in on top of her because she was leaning against the door.
[02-Jul-2013 01:45:37]  * Snezana looks up at Yuna
[02-Jul-2013 01:45:39]  <Snezana> "howdy ho"
[02-Jul-2013 01:45:42]  <Sumire> 14how very anime
[02-Jul-2013 01:45:43]  <Yui> "I may be giving him too much credit, but--" Yui breaks midsentence
[02-Jul-2013 01:45:56]  <IllFlower> And a million yuri fanartists grabbed their tablet styluses...

[02-Jul-2013 01:46:28]  * Yuna flails and tries to get out from under the huge Snezana

[02-Jul-2013 01:46:40]  <Yuna> W-w-who are you @_@
[02-Jul-2013 01:46:43]  * Sumire offers hand to Snezana to help her up
[02-Jul-2013 01:46:46]  <Yui> "YUNA! Hi! Sorry for dropping by unannounced but there are important things and stuff to talk about!"
[02-Jul-2013 01:46:51]  * Yuna looks up and sees Yui and breathes out the air in her lungs 
[02-Jul-2013 01:47:02]  <Alicia> 15Yuni.
[02-Jul-2013 01:47:08]  * Snezana looks at Sumire's hand questionably, then gets up on her own, giving sumire a firm handshake
[02-Jul-2013 01:47:11]  <Sumire> 14yuyu, Alicia
[02-Jul-2013 01:47:22]  <Alicia> 14Heh, right.
[02-Jul-2013 01:47:23]  <Yui> "first of all, is there a place we can lie Sumire down? She's not feeling well."
[02-Jul-2013 01:47:24]  <IllFlower> Everything's Yuyushiki these days.
[02-Jul-2013 01:47:49]  <Snezana> No snezana yuri ;_;
[02-Jul-2013 01:47:53]  <Yuna> Um... eeesh... I... what... who is./... my mom's out and um... I guess you can bring her up to my room?
[02-Jul-2013 01:48:06]  * Snezana offers to carry Sumire
[02-Jul-2013 01:48:10]  <Yui> "I'll explain everything, I promise"
[02-Jul-2013 01:48:47]  <Sumire> "I don't think I need carried, Snezana, but I do think I will commandeer Yuna's bed as soon as possible."  She walks in and starts up the stairs, forgetting to take off her shoes.
[02-Jul-2013 01:49:12]  <BGTB2005> 14D:
[02-Jul-2013 01:49:20]  <Yui> ((Snezana, am I introducing you or are you introducing yourself?))
[02-Jul-2013 01:49:21]  <Snezana> "Yuna, do you have a medicine cabinet? like a thermometer and stuff?"
[02-Jul-2013 01:49:34]  <Snezana> ((I think I already introuced myself))
[02-Jul-2013 01:49:53]  <Yuna> S-sumire... you should take off your shoes... or my mom will get mad...
[02-Jul-2013 01:50:05]  <Yuna> ((I don'tthink you have...))
[02-Jul-2013 01:50:13]  <Snezana> ((I did land on you and say hi))
[02-Jul-2013 01:50:20]  <Yuna> ((yes but I have no idea who you are)
[02-Jul-2013 01:50:23]  <Sumire> 14was Snezana there for the Karin fight?
[02-Jul-2013 01:50:30]  <Yui> ((she was not
[02-Jul-2013 01:50:33]  <Snezana> I wasn't
[02-Jul-2013 01:50:39]  <Snezana> says Snezana, breaking the fourth wall
[02-Jul-2013 01:50:56]  <Yuna> "Um... the medicine cabinet is upstairs in my mom's bedroom... what do you need...?"
[02-Jul-2013 01:51:08]  <Snezana> "Yuna, this is sudden, but I'll explain things in a little bit, for now we need to make sure Sumire's okay. We had a bit of an... incident"
[02-Jul-2013 01:51:16]  * Snezana goes by the window, peering outside
[02-Jul-2013 01:51:22]  * Sumire , slightly up the stairs, takes off the shoes and half-heartedly drops them down at the base of them
[02-Jul-2013 01:51:49]  <Snezana> "Well, do you got something I can take temperature with?"
[02-Jul-2013 01:51:56]  <Snezana> "just to make sure she's okay"
[02-Jul-2013 01:52:04]  <Snezana> ((insert no, leading to yuri forehead check))
[02-Jul-2013 01:52:21]  * Yuna runs upstairs and grabs the thermometer and runs back down
[02-Jul-2013 01:52:51]  * Snezana takes the thermoeter, "Hvala"
[02-Jul-2013 01:53:11]  * Snezana follows Sumire, "Hey Yui, can you get Yuna on to speed on things? I'll be right down."
[02-Jul-2013 01:53:22]  <Yui> "Sure thing."
[02-Jul-2013 01:53:48]  * Snezana goes to wherever Sumire is
[02-Jul-2013 01:53:55]  * Sumire , at the top of the stairs, walks into the door labeled "Yuna" and collapses onto the bed
[02-Jul-2013 01:54:14]  <Yui> "I really am sorry about barging in unannounced. A lot has happened since the last witch fight."
[02-Jul-2013 01:54:28]  * Snezana walks in the room
[02-Jul-2013 01:54:44]  <Snezana> "Let me take your temperature, say ahh and think of cheese sticks"
[02-Jul-2013 01:55:20]  <Sumire> "Cheese sticks?
[02-Jul-2013 01:55:47]  * Snezana puts the thermometer in her mouth
[02-Jul-2013 01:56:03]  <Snezana> ((Illflower give me the news straight))
[02-Jul-2013 01:56:04]  <IllFlower> The thermometer sits idle for a few moments as it takes Sumire's temperature.
[02-Jul-2013 01:56:05]  <Yuna> "Oh no... sorry I wasn't there to help..."
[02-Jul-2013 01:57:10]  <IllFlower> Then a beep, and a reading: 36.8 degrees Celsius. Just about exactly normal. **
[02-Jul-2013 01:58:17]  * Snezana takes out the thermometer, "Well good to see thats normal"
[02-Jul-2013 01:58:27]  * Snezana takes her right hand, extending all her fingers
[02-Jul-2013 01:58:32]  <Snezana> "how many fingers do you see?"
[02-Jul-2013 01:58:46]  <Sumire> "Five." 14I'm assuming Snezana doesn't have any missing fingers.
[02-Jul-2013 01:58:55]  <Snezana> ((yeah she's not an assassin))
[02-Jul-2013 01:59:19]  <Sumire> 14when I broke my wrist my anasthesiologist was missing a finger.
[02-Jul-2013 01:59:53]  <Snezana> "Well, stranger things have happened. Do you know if you can transform?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:00:29]  <Sumire> "I don't know for sure, but probably.  Is anyone watching?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:01:05]  <Snezana> "A good question, I didn't sense anything obvious... oh, you mean... yeah no one is watching, want me to turn around?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:02:22]  * Sumire quietly attempts to transform on the bed, in perhaps the least enthusiastic transformation sequence ever to be associated with Sumire Shirayuki.
[02-Jul-2013 02:02:34]  <Yuna> "S-so... Yui... what.... what's happened since?  and who is this...?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:02:48]  * Yuna nervously tries to get a word in while still a bit fuddled
[02-Jul-2013 02:02:59]  <IllFlower> As Sumire transforms, Snezana looks out a nearby window. She doesn't see anything unusual at first, but just as she turns back towards Sumire, she notices that the image is... wrong, somehow.
[02-Jul-2013 02:03:22]  <Sumire> 14which image
[02-Jul-2013 02:03:34]  <Snezana> ((I guess your transformation))
[02-Jul-2013 02:03:41]  <BGTB2005> 14check signal cables?
[02-Jul-2013 02:03:42]  <IllFlower> For the briefest moment, it looks like someone's holding a giant mirror at an angle outside -- but then the effect abruptly fades. **
[02-Jul-2013 02:04:10]  * Snezana closes the blinds
[02-Jul-2013 02:04:19]  <Yui> ((I'm kinda waiting for them to run their scene since trying to sort through both of those happening at the same time 
[02-Jul-2013 02:04:26]  <IllFlower> (There is no actual person, just to be clear, simply an odd mirror effect.)

[02-Jul-2013 02:04:42]  <Snezana> "Sumire, did you just make a mirror outside?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:04:48]  * Yuna mutters to Yui     "why... why are they transforming... in my room?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:04:50]  * Snezana turns to Sumire
[02-Jul-2013 02:05:58]  <Snezana> ((anything to report?))
[02-Jul-2013 02:06:02]  <Yui> "Something happened on the way here. Giant sheets of glass falling from the sky weird, and Sumire was all doubled over and it was really scary but Snezana stopped most of the glass from slicing us to smithereens"
[02-Jul-2013 02:06:52]  <Yui> "also, on the topic of weird things that have happened, Pyunpyun has decided I am no longer under his care because of my disobedience."
[02-Jul-2013 02:06:57]  <Sumire> "I don't think I did, Snezana."
[02-Jul-2013 02:07:29]  <Snezana> "Then we just got made"
[02-Jul-2013 02:07:36]  <Yuna> "Diso...bediance....?"   
[02-Jul-2013 02:07:43]  * Yuna is kind of overwhelmed and needs much more filling in than that
[02-Jul-2013 02:08:02]  <Yui> "transforming and fighting that witch to get your flashlight back"
[02-Jul-2013 02:08:11]  <Yui> "after he said not to use magic"
[02-Jul-2013 02:08:14]  * Snezana shouts to Yuna, "Hey do you have a couch we can use downstairs?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:08:19]  * Snezana turns towards Sumire
[02-Jul-2013 02:08:38]  <Yuna> "But the witch attacked us..."
[02-Jul-2013 02:08:41]  <Snezana> "hate to do this, but lets move back downstairs, its probably not safe here"
[02-Jul-2013 02:08:47]  <Yuna> "Did he just want you to die instead...?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:09:05]  <Sumire> "This time I think I'll take you up on the carrying thing, though."
[02-Jul-2013 02:09:19]  <Sumire> 14suddenly, the yuri fangirls got even more excited
[02-Jul-2013 02:09:23]  <Yui> "he said there were more than enough of you even without Makoto and I risking ourselves, so now we're disowned"
[02-Jul-2013 02:09:37]  * Snezana picks up sumire using the fireman carry

[02-Jul-2013 02:10:01]  * Snezana notices Yui and Yuna talking
[02-Jul-2013 02:10:08]  <Yuna> ((this seems really hard to follow with two things going on at once... I'm kind of lost))
[02-Jul-2013 02:10:22]  <Snezana> "Yo, we have a problem. Someone is watching us. Made a giant mirror."
[02-Jul-2013 02:10:43]  <Snezana> ((is there a couch in the room?))
[02-Jul-2013 02:10:59]  <IllFlower> Just assume there is. You want to set Sumire down, yes?
[02-Jul-2013 02:11:04]  <Yui> ((that's why I was waiting until their scene was over, babe))
[02-Jul-2013 02:11:06]  <Snezana> yes
[02-Jul-2013 02:11:17]  <Yuna> ((yes but it didn't seem like it'd end any time soon and I am confused but um... okay))
[02-Jul-2013 02:11:21]  <Yuna> ((I'll just wait then...))

[02-Jul-2013 02:16:42]  <Yui> "I got as far as sheets of glass on the way here and pyunpyun disowning me."

[02-Jul-2013 02:18:56]  <Snezana> "And I think the reason that pyun-pyun disowned Yui was so that if she gets killed, he doesn't have to do anything."
[02-Jul-2013 02:19:26]  <Snezana> "Scorcher... was a really bad guy, he was able to fry people's brains... usually the person would suddenly collapse"

[02-Jul-2013 02:21:41]  <Snezana> "Sorry, I'd do a proper introduction but I don't think we're safe here. so lets try and get as much out of our time here, yes?"

[02-Jul-2013 02:22:28]  <Snezana> "I-I basically need to know what happened, because where I'm from, it happened suddenly that people started using witches."
[02-Jul-2013 02:22:36]  <Snezana> "So its really important that we all know what happened."
[02-Jul-2013 02:22:55]  * Yuna glances around nervously and tries to say something, but can't seem to form a word.
[02-Jul-2013 02:23:32]  * Yuna steps slowly back towards the wall, where there's an open closet with a bunch of tops and some dresses hanging

[02-Jul-2013 02:30:28]  * Snezana doesn't see anything outside, but looks for something glass inside the kitchen, finding a glass cup
[02-Jul-2013 02:30:38]  <Snezana> "Sumire, you said you could fix glass cups right?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:31:02]  <BGTB2005> %c14this can't end badly

[02-Jul-2013 02:32:06]  * Snezana goes in front of Sumire, and gives the glass a gentle tap, injecting enough void magic to cause cracks to form all around the glass"
[02-Jul-2013 02:32:11]  * Snezana places the glass next to Sumire
[02-Jul-2013 02:32:16]  <Snezana> "can you see if you can repair that?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:32:26]  <Yuna> "O-okay... and... so... what was the thing with power over glass?  And mirrors and things... and... and pyunpyun..."
[02-Jul-2013 02:33:12]  <Yui> ((snezana gives zero fucks about anybody's belongings))
[02-Jul-2013 02:33:26]  <IllFlower> Has Snezana considered becoming a magical physician...?
[02-Jul-2013 02:34:08]  * Sumire picks up the cup, rotates it, then starts working her magic, silently hoping that it doesn't end up in a repeat of what happened earlier that night
[02-Jul-2013 02:35:12]  <Yui> "Sumire. Sumire's attacks are glass based. Like mine are shadow and yours are light."
[02-Jul-2013 02:35:30]  <Snezana> "As mine are void based, don't forget"
[02-Jul-2013 02:37:44]  <Snezana> Illflower: I can only imagine adventures of snezana the travelling magical physician kleptomaniac
[02-Jul-2013 02:38:12]  <Yuna> "Oh, okay... that makes sense"
[02-Jul-2013 02:38:13]  <IllFlower> It'd be like Mononoke's Medicine Seller, except with less sanity.
[02-Jul-2013 02:38:24]  <Yuna> "And the others...?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:40:06]  <Yui> "Mirrors and things is just as new to me, since I was downstairs with you when that happened. As for Pyun-pyun, I have no idea. That's why we need you to tell us about what happened with Kei."
[02-Jul-2013 02:40:12]  <Snezana> Illflower: at least we know what the sequel to this campaign will be about
[02-Jul-2013 02:40:26]  <Snezana> ((What happens to Sumire's glass repair attempt?))
[02-Jul-2013 02:40:43]  <Yuna> "I meant... you said he disowned you... um... that... that sounds kind of serious...
[02-Jul-2013 02:42:10]  <IllFlower> Sumire heals the cup okay, though a few of the deeper cracks leave visible seams. Oh, well, nobody's perfect.
[02-Jul-2013 02:42:37]  <Yui> "Yes, and that's all the intel I have. I'm a free agent, and so is Makoto. Beyond that, everything is Snezana's conjecture."
[02-Jul-2013 02:42:42]  <IllFlower> (I think we should focus on Yuna's ongoing conversation. It is the whole reason you guys came here, after all. :p)
[02-Jul-2013 02:43:11]  <Snezana> ((implying priorities are straight))
[02-Jul-2013 02:43:26]  <Yuna> "He really... he really just... disowned you?  Like, seriously?  He can... he can *do* that?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:44:13]  <Snezana> "Well thats good at least, I'll go check out how life is in the closet"
[02-Jul-2013 02:44:27]  * Snezana walks over to where Yui and Yuna is, quietly listening in
[02-Jul-2013 02:44:30]  <Yui> "Apparently. There was another magical boy who showed up, Hiroaki. Apparently he lives near me. At any rate he seemed surprised not that it happened, just that it was happening here"
[02-Jul-2013 02:45:28]  * Sumire half tries to listen to Yui and Yuna, half tries to get some rest.
[02-Jul-2013 02:46:04]  <Yuna> "Geez... he was always kind of a douche anyways.  Good riddance..."
[02-Jul-2013 02:46:20]  <Sumire> 14Yuna basically shares Sumire's opinion of Pyunpyun.
[02-Jul-2013 02:46:53]  <Yuna> ((yuna is also doing that thing that I sometimes subconsciously do myself where I retroactively justify a situation))
[02-Jul-2013 02:47:21]  <Yui> "He may have been a douche, but you're still under his protection and I think it best that you stay that way."
[02-Jul-2013 02:47:32]  * Snezana rests her back against the closed part of the closet, her arms folded
[02-Jul-2013 02:47:41]  <Yuna> "Really...?  Even though he disowned you...?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:47:59]  <Snezana> "As long as you are under his protection, he can't let something bad happen to you."
[02-Jul-2013 02:48:03]  <Yuna> "If it's going to be like that, I don't /want/ to be under his "protection". What has his "protection" ever done for us anyways...?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:48:12]  <Yuna> "Saved people...?  I don't think so..."
[02-Jul-2013 02:48:39]  <Snezana> "As bad as it may be, he lets you go, you become free game."
[02-Jul-2013 02:48:56]  <Snezana> "You know how you get stronger from fighting witches? Think about what you get from taking out an initiate."
[02-Jul-2013 02:49:03]  <Yuna> "And we're not already...?  Geez, isn't that part of being a magical girl?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:50:15]  <Yuna> "I don't trust him anyways, if he'll just happily disown you like that, he'll likely sell any of the rest of us out for a chocolate bar."
[02-Jul-2013 02:50:19]  <Snezana> "Isn't being an initiate also taking care of witches instead of becomnig them?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:50:32]  * Snezana opens the closet door
[02-Jul-2013 02:50:46]  * Snezana and bumps her head, grasping it in pain

[02-Jul-2013 02:51:45]  * Sumire sits up a bit on the couch
[02-Jul-2013 02:51:54]  <IllFlower> lol, as his writer, I feel a little bad for Pyunpyun. Only a little, though.
[02-Jul-2013 02:52:21]  <Yuna> "I mean, seriously, what did he ever do for us?"
[02-Jul-2013 02:52:31]  <Sumire> "Lied, mostly, I think."
[02-Jul-2013 02:52:38]  <Yuna> "He let a bunch of students at school get killed, he led us on wild goose chases, and then betrayed you."
[02-Jul-2013 02:52:43]  <Yuna> "And told us nothing."
[02-Jul-2013 02:52:53]  <Yuna> "That sounds like just about the opposite of protection."

[02-Jul-2013 03:56:29]  <IllFlower> Okay, then.
[02-Jul-2013 03:57:29]  <IllFlower> It's fair to say some relationships are getting strained if this goes much further. Do keep an eye on those strain capacities...

[02-Jul-2013 03:57:51]  <Yuna> ((???))

[02-Jul-2013 04:40:24]  <IllFlower> Or run. I would suggest a modicum of haste.
[02-Jul-2013 04:41:27]  <Snezana> ((cracks begin forming all around snezana))
[02-Jul-2013 04:41:38]  <IllFlower> Snezana: Before you do anything, roll d6 for me.
[02-Jul-2013 04:41:38]  <BGTB2005> 14a glass, a closet door, a wall, a house. Wild Party at Yuna's?
[02-Jul-2013 04:41:46]  <Yuna> ((where is snezana???))
[02-Jul-2013 04:41:49]  <Snezana> +roll d6
[02-Jul-2013 04:41:49]  <rollermine> Snezana: 2=2
[02-Jul-2013 04:42:03]  <Yuna> ((I don't understand what's going on))
[02-Jul-2013 04:42:17]  <Snezana> ((I'm taking fallout for my fury))
[02-Jul-2013 04:42:18]  <IllFlower> Snezana hasn't left Yuna's place, so I assume she's still there.
[02-Jul-2013 04:42:26]  <Snezana> I'm wherever I fell inside
[02-Jul-2013 04:42:29]  <Snezana> so I'm by the window
[02-Jul-2013 04:42:43]  * Yuna is chasing after Yui then
[02-Jul-2013 04:42:54]  <Snezana> so Yuna heard me tell the others to get out and that cracks are forming everywhere
[02-Jul-2013 04:42:56]  <Yui> ((I thought you were outside))
[02-Jul-2013 04:43:03]  <Yuna> ((Um... but you're outside too))
[02-Jul-2013 04:43:08]  <Snezana> ((she breaks through the window?))
[02-Jul-2013 04:43:21]  <Yuna> ((how is this a problem @_@))
[02-Jul-2013 04:43:41]  <Snezana> ((well you entering the house right now will make things very interesting))
[02-Jul-2013 04:43:52]  <Yuna> ((but I'm not entering the house, I'm following yui home...))
[02-Jul-2013 04:43:59]  <Yuna> ((I just said it...))
[02-Jul-2013 04:44:12]  <IllFlower> Snezana's still inside, but everyone else has left.
[02-Jul-2013 04:44:46]  <Snezana> ((cool so I get to rampage)))
[02-Jul-2013 04:45:04]  <Sumire> 14Yuna's mom is going to be so pissed
[02-Jul-2013 04:45:21]  <IllFlower> Which was probably a good idea, because Snezana is on the verge of flying into a total rage.
[02-Jul-2013 04:45:42]  <Yui> ((Yuna herself is gonna be pissed))
[02-Jul-2013 04:45:49]  * Yuna catches up with Yui and nervously steps up behind the two
[02-Jul-2013 04:45:53]  * Snezana Slowly stands up, the cracks running deeper and a chill wind running through the house. She lets out a mute scream, and suddenly space itself appears to get distorted. Snezana is being covered inside what appears to be a black goo
[02-Jul-2013 04:46:05]  <Yui> ((she was having a nice quiet evening and Snezana broke her house))
[02-Jul-2013 04:46:27]  <Yuna> "Y-yui..."
[02-Jul-2013 04:46:33]  <Sumire> 14Snezana, you and the last 500 survivors of humanity are on two boats.
[02-Jul-2013 04:46:40]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@203.116.251.231> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[02-Jul-2013 04:46:40]  <IllFlower> Holes begin appearing in the walls, the floor, the furniture.
[02-Jul-2013 04:47:03]  * Snezana slowly walks through the house, silently howling, as everything begins to get torn apart. The street outside begins to implode, a massive sinkhole is forming with what appears to be a giant sphere enveloping the house
[02-Jul-2013 04:47:08]  <Yuna> ((oh gosh, she really is going to destroy my house))
[02-Jul-2013 04:47:09]  <Yui> "Yuna?"
[02-Jul-2013 04:47:24]  <IllFlower> Snezana: Hold for a second.
[02-Jul-2013 04:47:28]  * Yuna runs up and hugs Yui and clings to her
[02-Jul-2013 04:47:32]  <Yui> ((party at the aoyama residence))
[02-Jul-2013 04:47:34]  * Yuna de-transforms
[02-Jul-2013 04:47:44]  * Yui clings back
[02-Jul-2013 04:47:56]  * Snezana ends up out on the street
[02-Jul-2013 04:48:14]  <BGTB2005> 14and there goes the neighbourhood
[02-Jul-2013 04:48:49]  <Sumire> 14literally
[02-Jul-2013 04:49:08]  <Snezana> ((za warudo))
[02-Jul-2013 04:49:18]  <Yuna> Y-you're... you're... you're okay...
[02-Jul-2013 04:49:27]  <IllFlower> Whoa, still holding.
[02-Jul-2013 04:50:05]  <Yuna> ((can we at least get like a minute before things start happening? >_<))
[02-Jul-2013 04:50:32]  <IllFlower> It doesn't make sense except as an immediate reaction.
[02-Jul-2013 04:50:49]  <Yuna> ((????))
[02-Jul-2013 04:50:55]  <Yuna> ((what is "it"??))
[02-Jul-2013 04:51:07]  <Yuna> ((I'm confused again I don't know what's happening I'm just trying to talk with yui))
[02-Jul-2013 04:51:14]  <IllFlower> You'll find out once I finish typing...
[02-Jul-2013 04:51:20]  <Sumire> 14It's it. </faithnomore>
[02-Jul-2013 04:52:03]  <IllFlower> Without warning, a series of lenses and mirrors appears in midair, curving around the holes swallowing parts of Snezana's house.
[02-Jul-2013 04:52:15]  <Snezana> cool I got yuna's house
[02-Jul-2013 04:52:23]  <IllFlower> Er, sorry, Yuna's house.
[02-Jul-2013 04:53:23]  * Snezana looks blankly at the mirrors
[02-Jul-2013 04:53:49]  * Snezana places a hand one of them, hoping to watch it shatter
[02-Jul-2013 04:53:58]  <IllFlower> A beam of light flies through the path they've set, hitting Snezana squarely in the chest and knocking her out of a nearby wall, which up until that point had been doing an admirable job of remaining standing.
[02-Jul-2013 04:55:07]  <Sumire> 14gosh this would be so ridiculously cool animated
[02-Jul-2013 04:55:33]  <IllFlower> The other initiates turn to look for the source of the attack, and find... who else but Hiroaki?
[02-Jul-2013 04:55:53]  <IllFlower> Okay, I'm going to end the session here. Cliffhanger! We'll pick up with the battle next time.
[02-Jul-2013 04:56:07]  <Snezana> man snezana is going to in full on kill mode
[02-Jul-2013 04:56:09]  <Yui> D:
[02-Jul-2013 04:56:14]  <Sumire> 14oshit
[02-Jul-2013 04:56:15]  <Yuna> is... is she witchifying?
[02-Jul-2013 04:56:36]  <Snezana> ((also I totally find a way to grab my sexy mp-412 rex revolver))
[02-Jul-2013 04:56:45]  <Yui> She's dealing with fallout and Hiroaki is attacking, I think
[02-Jul-2013 04:56:52]  <Sumire> 14what Yui said
[02-Jul-2013 04:57:04]  <Yuna> so she decided to overcharge in the middle of my house
[02-Jul-2013 04:57:24]  <Sumire> 14well, IC Snezana said she had fifteen minutes before she'd lose control
[02-Jul-2013 04:57:40]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, everyone.
