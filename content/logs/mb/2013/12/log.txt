[24-Feb-2013 20:10:34]  <IllFlower> we'll go ahead and pick up where we left off last episode.
[24-Feb-2013 20:11:50]  <Yuna> ((I have no idea where that is really))
[24-Feb-2013 20:11:53]  <IllFlower> the sun has gone down by now, the late evening rainstorm that was presaged earlier now bearing down full bore on the city.
[24-Feb-2013 20:12:27]  <Sumire> 14Kaede helped Sumire and Snezana fight a witch; they've now gone their separate ways
[24-Feb-2013 20:13:54]  <IllFlower> Sumire and Yuna stand opposite Kaede and Shun in a large room located on the ground floor of an anonymous building.
[24-Feb-2013 20:14:33]  <Yuna> ((how did I get here?  I have no ideawhat's going on or who shun is))
[24-Feb-2013 20:14:36]  <Sumire> 14so is this where I ask "what the hell is going on"?
[24-Feb-2013 20:14:42]  <Sumire> 14Shun is the most useless initiate ever.
[24-Feb-2013 20:14:46]  <Sumire> 14that's who Shun is.
[24-Feb-2013 20:14:50]  <IllFlower> there are chairs scattered here and there, as well as a desk. the only light entering the room comes at odd angles from the streetlights outside the window.
[24-Feb-2013 20:15:30]  <IllFlower> Sumire, hesitant to deal with Kaede and Shun alone now that Snezana has left, has called Yuna and Aoi over for some support.
[24-Feb-2013 20:15:46]  <IllFlower> Yuna, of course, has no idea what's going on, and it seems Aoi, in characteristic fashion, is running quite late.
[24-Feb-2013 20:15:57]  <Yuna> ((how did I even get here))
[24-Feb-2013 20:16:08]  <BGTB2005> 14magic
[24-Feb-2013 20:16:10]  <Sumire> 14presumably Kikugawa has a good public transit system
[24-Feb-2013 20:16:18]  <Aoi> 14what are you impling Illflower :|
[24-Feb-2013 20:16:40]  <Sumire> 14possibly with short animations of Double-H doing increasingly bizarre things
[24-Feb-2013 20:17:49]  <IllFlower> I'm just assuming Sumire phoned Yuna (while it wasn't yet pouring) and went "yo, need your help, come over plzkthx." it's as good an explanation as any, right? >_>
[24-Feb-2013 20:19:18]  <IllFlower> all Yuna recognizes is Kaede's face -- she's the girl Yuna met earlier in the week, with whom things went so disastrously...
[24-Feb-2013 20:20:03]  <IllFlower> Shun is the first to speak. "so, what's the deal here?" he asks Sumire. "what'd you want to talk to us about?"
[24-Feb-2013 20:20:29]  * Yuna stands nervously, not sure what she's supposed to be doing here
[24-Feb-2013 20:20:29]  <IllFlower> something else seems to come to his mind before Sumire can respond, though. "actually, what's your name? and who's the other girl?" **
[24-Feb-2013 20:22:25]  <IllFlower> (Sumire: this is where you ask "what the hell is going on?!" :p)
[24-Feb-2013 20:23:20]  <Sumire> "Sumire Shirayuki.  The other girl is Yuna Tsukino; she's another initiate.  And what I want to talk to you about is...WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?  How, when I recall clearly you, Kaede, coming to my locker to insult me every other day for the past two years, you remember nothing?"
[24-Feb-2013 20:23:31]  <Sumire> 14I hope this is what you want.
[24-Feb-2013 20:25:16]  <IllFlower> Shun holds his hands up in the air in a defensive pose. "whoa, princess, slow down. at least let us introduce ourselves before we get to the trial, okay?"
[24-Feb-2013 20:27:47]  <IllFlower> he takes a deep breath. "you know this already, but my name's Shun Koide. and, well" -- he tilts his head towards Kaede, who's leaning in silence against a nearby wall -- "she's Kaede Asahina."
[24-Feb-2013 20:28:01]  <IllFlower> (subtle reminder to check the NPC summary goes here...)
[24-Feb-2013 20:28:32]  <Sumire> 14I think it was Serizawa.
[24-Feb-2013 20:28:39]  <IllFlower> "okay, now that we're all familiar with each other, the prosecution may resume making their arguments..." **
[24-Feb-2013 20:28:56]  <Sumire> 14I was about to say "Asahina's Aoi's last name", but no, that's Dangan Ronpa.
[24-Feb-2013 20:29:37]  <IllFlower> Sumire: hm. I wonder why the names are different...
[24-Feb-2013 20:30:12]  <Yuna> "Pr...prosecution...?"
[24-Feb-2013 20:30:19]  <Sumire> 14yeah, Serizawa's what it says on all the charts
[24-Feb-2013 20:30:24]  <Aoi> 14cheeky bastard, isn't he
[24-Feb-2013 20:30:25]  * Yuna nervously fidgets with her right hand and looks around confused
[24-Feb-2013 20:30:32]  <Yuna> "Sumire... what's... what's going on?"
[24-Feb-2013 20:30:43]  <Yuna> "Who's being prosecuted...?"
[24-Feb-2013 20:31:14]  <IllFlower> Aoi: I mean, he does look like Sid Vicious with a racing stripe in his hair.
[24-Feb-2013 20:32:51]  <IllFlower> Sumire: yes, that's intentional.
[24-Feb-2013 20:33:02]  <IllFlower> it's what Sumire remembers and what you have to work from.
[24-Feb-2013 20:34:06]  <Sumire> "I think he's just making some joke about me confronting them?  At any rate, the last two years seem to have changed overnight, and I want an answer from the people most directly involved, which I think are Kaede and Pyunpyun, and, well, fuzzbutt isn't exactly confrontable..."
[24-Feb-2013 20:34:39]  <Sumire> 14so should Sumire notice that Shun just gave Kaede a completely different last name?"
[24-Feb-2013 20:34:46]  <IllFlower> Sumire: yes.
[24-Feb-2013 20:34:49]  <IllFlower> very much so.
[24-Feb-2013 20:36:01]  <Sumire> "...wait a second.  Asahina?  So not only have you forgotten what you did to me the last two years, you've forgotten your own last name?"
[24-Feb-2013 20:36:03]  <IllFlower> that's what all the progressively less subtle hints were pointing you towards. :p
[24-Feb-2013 20:37:23]  <Yuna> "Um... Sumire... maybe you're just mistaking her for someone else...?"
[24-Feb-2013 20:37:35]  <Yuna> "There's lots of people with the same first name after all..."
[24-Feb-2013 20:37:45]  <Sumire> "Kaede Serizawa is pretty unmistakable.  Very few girls look exactly like that."
[24-Feb-2013 20:38:34]  <IllFlower> "I don't think her name is up to you to decide," Shun says. "you look too young to be working for the city's family registrar."
[24-Feb-2013 20:39:22]  <IllFlower> at the mention of the name "Serizawa," though, Kaede abruptly speaks up. "wait a second," she says, slowly lifting her head towards Sumire.
[24-Feb-2013 20:39:31]  <IllFlower> "how do you know...?" **
[24-Feb-2013 20:41:35]  <Yuna> (dramatic music)
[24-Feb-2013 20:43:20]  <IllFlower> (Yuna: not to prescribe your character's behavior or anything, but in case you're still lost -- since all she knows of Kaede is what you saw a couple of sessions ago, I figure she'd probably try to be a conciliator and walk back some of Sumire's anger :p)
[24-Feb-2013 20:44:13]  <Sumire> "How did I know...your surname?  The teacher says it every time she calls attendance, not to mention every time you name-checked your oh-so-important father and his oh-so-important job with that oh-so-important corporation."
[24-Feb-2013 20:45:45]  <Yuna> ((Yuna doesn't really feel knowledgable about the situation to try that yet, I don't think, since she would feel awful trying to tell someone who's been bullied not to be angry at someone who bullied her...?))
[24-Feb-2013 20:46:06]  <Sumire> 14that depends on how much trust she puts in Sumire's story, though, doesn't it?
[24-Feb-2013 20:46:46]  <Yuna> ((even if I don't trust it, that's how /she feels/, and I can't tell her that her own beliefs are wrong...))
[24-Feb-2013 20:46:56]  <IllFlower> Shun glares at Sumire. he turns to Yuna, and with a bitter tone in his voice, interrupts, "objection! the prosecution's brow-beating the witness."
[24-Feb-2013 20:47:02]  <Yuna> ((it's not like I lived her life, I can't really know hwether or not she was bullied))
[24-Feb-2013 20:47:35]  <Yuna> "Who's... who's the witness?"
[24-Feb-2013 20:48:27]  <IllFlower> Kaede barely responds, however. she gets up from the wall, putting a hand in front of Shun as if to say "back off."
[24-Feb-2013 20:48:58]  <Yuna> ((yuna is really confused and this is the kind of situation where she would reflexively just want to shy away because she's dealing with a lot of aggressive people and doesn't want to be caught in the crossfire))
[24-Feb-2013 20:49:43]  <IllFlower> calmly, she says, "I haven't been Kaede Serizawa for eight years. I haven't seen my father in almost as long. he has nothing to do with me any more.
[24-Feb-2013 20:50:44]  <IllFlower> "I don't know what he might have done to you, and I hope it's nothing severe, but I can't apologize for someone else's wrongs." **
[24-Feb-2013 20:53:33]  <IllFlower> Aoi: hang on tight; you're coming in soon!
[24-Feb-2013 20:53:42]  * Aoi 14flexes
[24-Feb-2013 20:53:50]  <Sumire> "The only thing he did to me was be your father.  These are your wrongs."
[24-Feb-2013 20:57:18]  <IllFlower> Kaede merely shakes her head. 
[24-Feb-2013 20:57:51]  <IllFlower> the expression on her face is utterly indecipherable.
[24-Feb-2013 20:59:04]  *** JackMackerel <~JackMacke@75-51-144-9.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net> has joined #madokamadness
[24-Feb-2013 21:01:07]  <IllFlower> Shun turns his head towards Sumire again. "I've known Kaede since middle school," he says, dispensing with the comic lawyer facade. "I don't know what happened to you, but it couldn't possibly have been her fault.
[24-Feb-2013 21:04:18]  <IllFlower> "look at her." he gestures towards Kaede, who's returned to leaning against the wall, her eyes fixed in an unfocused stare at the bare cement floor. "does she look like the kind of person who would do that to you? she saved you from what might have been certain death, and yet she's just sitting here taking all of your baseless accusations.
[24-Feb-2013 21:05:28]  <IllFlower> "let me be clear," he says, an angry edge to his voice. "she's not at fault here. let her be." **
[24-Feb-2013 21:07:12]  <IllFlower> [let me know when you get tired of this, because that's Aoi's cue to enter ;)]
[24-Feb-2013 21:07:13]  <Yuna>  (( Xeniera : I've already lost <_>   I didn't even know that was a word )
[24-Feb-2013 21:07:21]  <Sumire> 14I think I have one or two more lines in me
[24-Feb-2013 21:07:46]  <Xeniera> Yuna: i dunno, if you play "zeal" again :P
[24-Feb-2013 21:08:45]  <IllFlower> Is "potrzebie" a valid Scrabble word? hehe
[24-Feb-2013 21:09:41]  <Sumire> "I have no idea what you two are playing here, but I definitely remember someone with the same appearance, the same voice, and even, as she just admitted, the same name, tormenting me without cease since halfway through middle school.  She may not look like the 'kind' of person to do such a thing, but she looks like the person who did."
[24-Feb-2013 21:09:56]  <Sumire> 14and yeah, I think I'm ready for Aoitime
[24-Feb-2013 21:10:08]  <Aoi> 14shun confirmed for racist??
[24-Feb-2013 21:10:29]  <Sumire> 14no, that'd be if he said "Does she look like a Korean to you?"
[24-Feb-2013 21:11:40]  <IllFlower> Shun's expression hardens. "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence," he spits.
[24-Feb-2013 21:12:37]  <IllFlower> he touches Kaede's shoulder. "we should go," he says to her, quietly.
[24-Feb-2013 21:13:49]  <IllFlower> as Kaede begins to lift herself from the wall, the door to the room opens, and Aoi emerges.
[24-Feb-2013 21:14:03]  <IllFlower> his clothes are absolutely soaked, and he's panting like he's just run a 5K, but curiously he doesn't seem to notice. **
[24-Feb-2013 21:14:39]  <Aoi> "Hey!"
[24-Feb-2013 21:14:43]  <Sumire> 14now will Aoi recognize Kaede?
[24-Feb-2013 21:14:54]  <Aoi> 14uh why would he
[24-Feb-2013 21:15:01]  <Sumire> 14classmates and shit
[24-Feb-2013 21:17:40]  <IllFlower> Shun glances over at Aoi, but doesn't seem to pay him much heed. Kaede, for her part, still seems to be pretty out of it.
[24-Feb-2013 21:17:58]  <IllFlower> looks like Yuna, Sumire, and Aoi have a moment to talk amongst themselves. **
[24-Feb-2013 21:18:20]  <IllFlower> (I'd start with explaining to him what's happening, since he hasn't even met Kaede yet. :p)
[24-Feb-2013 21:19:21]  <Sumire> 14Yuna?  You haven't spoken much here.
[24-Feb-2013 21:19:32]  <Yuna> ((I have no idea what to even say...))
[24-Feb-2013 21:19:35]  <Yuna> ((I'm sorry...)
[24-Feb-2013 21:19:40]  <Sumire> 14explain wtf's going on to Aoi
[24-Feb-2013 21:19:42]  <Yuna> ((I'm beyond lost...))
[24-Feb-2013 21:19:46]  <Yuna> ((I DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON))
[24-Feb-2013 21:19:49]  <Yuna> ((HOW CAN I EXPLAIN))
[24-Feb-2013 21:20:29]  <IllFlower> you can just tell him "I don't know what the hell is happening, but Sumire seems angry and I'm lost and aaaaaaaahhhhhh" ;)
[24-Feb-2013 21:20:46]  <Aoi> "'sup?"
[24-Feb-2013 21:21:57]  <IllFlower> or maybe just "Aoi, thank God you're here, maybe you can help sort this out"
[24-Feb-2013 21:22:43]  <Aoi> "I know I'm kind of late, but I was uh... studying really hard, you know?  I get all absorbed in those... algebra... letters."
[24-Feb-2013 21:23:07]  <Aoi> "Huh, she's tall."
[24-Feb-2013 21:23:10]  <IllFlower> (studying? over winter holiday? how diligent of you.)
[24-Feb-2013 21:23:35]  <Aoi> 14Aoi isn't good at lying when he's exhausted.
[24-Feb-2013 21:23:38]  <Sumire> 14he probably was 'studying' by which he means he had an algebra textbook open while dancing
[24-Feb-2013 21:24:03]  <IllFlower> a high-pitched keening sound begins to ring in Aoi's ears, though not so loudly as to be anything more than barely noticeable. **
[24-Feb-2013 21:24:14]  <Sumire> 14@w keening
[24-Feb-2013 21:24:14]  <Omnipresence> 14Sumire: Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keening — Keening is a form of vocal lament associated with mourning that is traditional in Ireland, Scotland, African, African-American, and other cultures.
[24-Feb-2013 21:24:27]  <Aoi> "..."
[24-Feb-2013 21:24:34]  <Aoi> "Anybody here?  Hi?"
[24-Feb-2013 21:24:44]  <Sumire> 14I'm waiting for Yuna because I feel like she should say something
[24-Feb-2013 21:25:20]  <Sumire> 14also she'd probably give a less biased account than Sumire
[24-Feb-2013 21:26:03]  <Sumire> 14whatever
[24-Feb-2013 21:26:04]  <IllFlower> Sumire should probably go ahead. I don't think Yuna will be able to say much.
[24-Feb-2013 21:26:07]  <Aoi> "How about you, dude?" he tries, indicating Shun.
[24-Feb-2013 21:26:20]  <Yuna> ((sorry... I kind of freeze up in RP stuff if I don't know what to do))
[24-Feb-2013 21:26:28]  <Sumire> 14alright.
[24-Feb-2013 21:26:32]  <IllFlower> we'll write off the silence as Aoi breaking into a very, very awkward moment.
[24-Feb-2013 21:26:44]  <IllFlower> which he kinda did, so.
[24-Feb-2013 21:26:48]  <Yuna> ((sorry for being so useless, I should have let someone else sign up))
[24-Feb-2013 21:27:29]  <IllFlower> Shun says nothing, only tilting his head towards the crumpled form of the girl at his side. **
[24-Feb-2013 21:27:32]  <Sumire> "Hey, Aoi.  That's Kaede.  I think you've probably seen her around the school?  She's currently pretending that she doesn't know me, and her friend with the weird hair is helping."
[24-Feb-2013 21:28:11]  <IllFlower> (important program note: she doesn't go to the same school. I can see why Sumire would assume she does, though, so keep on.)
[24-Feb-2013 21:28:39]  <Aoi> "I dunno, I think I'd remember someone that tall."
[24-Feb-2013 21:29:42]  <IllFlower> the buzzing in Aoi's head becomes louder on the mention of Kaede's name. it's actively distracting now, enough to make him unsure of what Sumire just said. **
[24-Feb-2013 21:30:05]  <Aoi> 14uh ok, scratch that then

[24-Feb-2013 21:35:03]  <Yuna> "Um... Sumire... I haven't seen her bully you at all so far here..."
[24-Feb-2013 21:35:11]  <Yuna> "Maybe the wish was interpreted a litle differently?"
[24-Feb-2013 21:35:32]  <Yuna> "Like, what if the wish instead rewrote the past, so she never became a bully, and wouldn't bully you anymore?"
[24-Feb-2013 21:36:19]  <IllFlower> the ringing is still loud enough to override Aoi's sense of hearing, though he does notice out of the corner of his eye that Kaede seems now to be looking straight at him.
[24-Feb-2013 21:36:38]  <IllFlower> I'll let Sumire and Yuna finish their conversation first before I proceed with that, though. **
[24-Feb-2013 21:37:46]  <Sumire> "I don't know how the wish could interpret 'No, I really just wish she'd go away...maybe someplace shitty like Fuyuki' that way though"

[24-Feb-2013 21:39:53]  <Yuna> "Maybe she did go away... but her place was taken by someone who looks similar, but isn't like her...?"

[24-Feb-2013 21:50:47]  <IllFlower> safe assumption.
[24-Feb-2013 21:51:11]  * Sumire starts going closer to Aoi.  "Are you okay?"
[24-Feb-2013 21:52:10]  <IllFlower> Shun brushes away some of Kaede's hair, and as Aoi finally gets a full view of her face --
[24-Feb-2013 21:52:35]  <IllFlower> all Aoi can hear, suddenly, is white noise. his vision tears like a poorly calibrated television signal.
[24-Feb-2013 21:52:57]  <Aoi> 14wow that's some creepy timing with ikeda
[24-Feb-2013 21:53:22]  <IllFlower> a babble of voices emerges from what feels like every corner of Aoi's mind.
[24-Feb-2013 21:53:40]  <Aoi> "Agh, what the fuck...!  What are you?  No no no no no not more"
[24-Feb-2013 21:54:09]  <Sumire> 14so what, have we been trapped in a witch all this time?

[24-Feb-2013 21:55:08]  <IllFlower> "why don't you --" "Aoi, could you come here for a second?" "dinner today is --" "-- repeat after me. 'discernment.'" "discern --" "visual confirmation of --"
[24-Feb-2013 21:56:22]  <IllFlower> an image of a young girl suddenly flashes before Aoi. "I'm" -- "nice to meet" -- a cordial bow --
[24-Feb-2013 21:57:18]  <IllFlower> flash forward to the same girl, now a few months older, skipping through the hallways of a Shibuya shopping mall. "Aoi! look here! look over here" -- excited pointing --

[24-Feb-2013 21:59:31]  <IllFlower> the next blast of white noise positively knocks Aoi off his feet, as if he'd just been hit by a train. he stumbles, grasping at his head -- his head -- all -- nothing -- **

[24-Feb-2013 22:01:42]  * Sumire rushes over to Aoi, ducks near his face.  "What's happening?  What's wrong?"

[24-Feb-2013 22:03:37]  <IllFlower> Kaede is curled up against the wall in a fetal position, her face covered in tears. she's crying so forcefully that she's close to having trouble breathing. **
[24-Feb-2013 22:06:03]  <Sumire> 14yeah, I really don't know what to say here beyond what more of what I'm already doing
[24-Feb-2013 22:06:23]  <Sumire> "Aoi?  Can you hear me?  What's going on?"
[24-Feb-2013 22:06:37]  <Aoi> 14can he?
[24-Feb-2013 22:06:38]  <IllFlower> Aoi can hear again, by the way.
[24-Feb-2013 22:06:44]  * Yuna nervously steps over to Kaede and tries to look her over
[24-Feb-2013 22:07:01]  <Aoi> "Ah... Sumire... uh... I don't know... ow..."
[24-Feb-2013 22:07:25]  * Sumire stands up, extends her hand to Aoi.
[24-Feb-2013 22:07:57]  <IllFlower> Shun looks at Yuna, his face twisted with helplessness. "Tsu-Tsukino, right? Do you know what's --" **
[24-Feb-2013 22:08:01]  * Aoi takes hand up, careful to face away from that thing
[24-Feb-2013 22:08:53]  <Yuna> "I don't... I don't know at all but... I want everyone here to be safe..."

[24-Feb-2013 22:11:21]  <Yuna> ((that's not what I mean ;-;))
[24-Feb-2013 22:11:58]  <IllFlower> Kaede looks desperately at Yuna, every muscle in her face trembling uncontrollably.
[24-Feb-2013 22:12:49]  <Sumire> "So what was going on down there, Aoi?  Are you okay now?"
[24-Feb-2013 22:13:05]  <IllFlower> "I know -- I *know* him -- Aoi -- Aoi -- we were --"
[24-Feb-2013 22:13:32]  * Aoi breathes
[24-Feb-2013 22:13:37]  <IllFlower> the effort of trying to remember anything more seems to tip Kaede back over the edge, though, and she begins sobbing again. **
[24-Feb-2013 22:14:34]  <Aoi> "I uh... I don't know... you're that... ss, my head hurts.  A lot.  nnnnnnrg"
[24-Feb-2013 22:15:08]  <IllFlower> he should be a *little* more affected by this than that. :p
[24-Feb-2013 22:15:21]  <Aoi> "I hated all those damn balls..."
[24-Feb-2013 22:15:29]  <IllFlower> though if words are failing him right now, that's perfectly acceptable.
[24-Feb-2013 22:15:29]  <Aoi> "hated, hated, hated, hate..."
[24-Feb-2013 22:15:33]  * Aoi falls down again
[24-Feb-2013 22:17:19]  * Yuna sits down, a look of confusion and panic on her fade, and stays with kaede, since she seems to be only other person here who has no idea what's going on...
[24-Feb-2013 22:18:04]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: you seem to have a *lot* of popcorn on hand :p
[24-Feb-2013 22:20:53]  <Sumire> 14okay, I think it might be time for IllFlower to drive things forward? >_>
[24-Feb-2013 22:21:27]  <IllFlower> I was hoping for a somewhat more concrete reaction to the whole "Kaede knows Aoi" thing...
[24-Feb-2013 22:21:47]  <Sumire> 14oh.
[24-Feb-2013 22:22:11]  <Sumire> 14well, Aoi never explicitly said anything, so I wasn't sure if Sumire's paying attention to Kaede et al
[24-Feb-2013 22:22:24]  <Aoi> 14I said Serizawa!
[24-Feb-2013 22:22:33]  <Sumire> 14oh whoops, you did
[24-Feb-2013 22:22:42]  <IllFlower> good job, guys :p
[24-Feb-2013 22:23:04]  <Sumire> 14the arc notes for this are going to be hilarious.  I can feel it.
[24-Feb-2013 22:23:20]  <Yuna> ((*still has no idea what's going on*))
[24-Feb-2013 22:24:06]  <Sumire> Sumire, noticing Aoi's falling down again, moves toward Kaede and the others.  "What just happened?  What did Kaede just do?"
[24-Feb-2013 22:24:33]  <Sumire> 14I'm not sure if a character with 3 Ag should be this assertive, but I guess that she got a nerve touched, so
[24-Feb-2013 22:26:50]  <IllFlower> Sumire's got issues with her. it's fair enough.

[24-Feb-2013 22:32:17]  <Sumire> "Aoi?  What's loud?"
[24-Feb-2013 22:33:50]  <IllFlower> (side note: the intro to Portishead's "Magic Doors" is a perfect transition from "Dataplex")

[24-Feb-2013 22:34:03]  * Aoi still facing away, awkwardly enough
[24-Feb-2013 22:35:34]  <IllFlower> Kaede looks up at Aoi again, regaining a bit of her composure. "it's Asahina now. but you never called me that anyway..." she forces a smile. **
[24-Feb-2013 22:36:09]  <Sumire> "Called her that?  Aoi, are you hiding something too?"
[24-Feb-2013 22:39:41]  <Aoi> "Hiding? Who's hiding anything. No hiding no sir everything out in the open like always. Ha ha."
[24-Feb-2013 22:40:22]  <IllFlower> ** nervous laughter detected **

[24-Feb-2013 22:43:45]  <IllFlower> at those words, Kaede's smile fades visibly, and she looks away again. "you don't have to..."
[24-Feb-2013 22:44:04]  <IllFlower> Shun, for his part, just looks flabbergasted. his face seems to be asking "what's a prole?" **
[24-Feb-2013 22:44:16]  <Sumire> 14pfffff, Shun
[24-Feb-2013 22:44:56]  <Aoi> "Eh, well, don't really have to do anything. Die, I suppose. Sumire, was there a witch?"
[24-Feb-2013 22:46:33]  <IllFlower> casual reminder that for extra drama potential, Aoi and Sumire currently have a functioning relationship.
[24-Feb-2013 22:46:44]  <Sumire> "There was one earlier, but Kaede helped another initiate and myself kill it.  It even left behind pocketwatches."  Sumire pulls out her reward.
[24-Feb-2013 22:47:57]  <Aoi> "Haha, right, right. Thanks Kaede."
[24-Feb-2013 22:49:22]  <IllFlower> "Mm." Kaede nods. she seems to be sparing as many words as she can. **
[24-Feb-2013 22:50:02]  <Yuna> "pocketwatches..."
[24-Feb-2013 22:50:20]  * Yuna mutters, wondering why a witch would leave those behind...
[24-Feb-2013 22:51:40]  <Sumire> "So why did you suddenly start talking about proles, Aoi?"
[24-Feb-2013 22:53:34]  <Aoi> "That guy. With the hair. Wacky, right."
[24-Feb-2013 22:53:39]  <Sumire> 14I feel like I haven't been very good on the RP front tonight.  Sorry

[24-Feb-2013 22:55:33]  <IllFlower> haha, fair.
[24-Feb-2013 22:56:07]  <IllFlower> Kaede watches Aoi's back trail from the room, some rainwater still dripping from his head.
[24-Feb-2013 22:57:09]  <IllFlower> Shun finally lifts Kaede up on his shoulders. her face is clear of tears now, but neither of them seem to be in particularly bright spirits.
[24-Feb-2013 22:57:53]  <Sumire> "Kaede, what's going on with Aoi?  What did you do to him?"
