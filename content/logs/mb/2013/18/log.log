[20-Jun-2013 01:06:30]  <IllFlower> Not even a day has passed since the fight with the witch that took Yuna's flashlight.
[20-Jun-2013 01:07:09]  <ponicalica> 14a day that felt like months

[20-Jun-2013 01:07:41]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun has called Makoto and Yui to his nest inside the abandoned concrete building, which neither of them has seen in months.
[20-Jun-2013 01:08:40]  <IllFlower> He's pacing, silently, back and forth in front of them. The atmosphere in the room is tenser than the skin of an overfilled balloon.
[20-Jun-2013 01:08:41]  <ponicalica> 14uh oh, someone's gonna get punished

[20-Jun-2013 01:11:01]  * Yui sidles up to Makoto pressing her arm to her buddy's
[20-Jun-2013 01:11:09]  <IllFlower> (Suddenly, six clones of Snezana emerge from the ground.)
[20-Jun-2013 01:11:15]  <Makoto> (pfff)
[20-Jun-2013 01:11:25]  <Snezana> How about Sushi
[20-Jun-2013 01:11:27]  <Snezana> for everyone
[20-Jun-2013 01:11:33]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun stops, looking out a nearby window.
[20-Jun-2013 01:11:48]  <Yui> "so, uh, pyunpyun, how may we help you this evening?"
[20-Jun-2013 01:11:49]  <ponicalica> 14snezana, can you put your OOC stuff in a different color or at least parentheses
[20-Jun-2013 01:11:55]  <Makoto> +roll d2
[20-Jun-2013 01:11:56]  <rollermine> Makoto: 1=1
[20-Jun-2013 01:12:04]  <Snezana> (Sorry)
[20-Jun-2013 01:12:10]  <IllFlower> He sighs heavily, then says, "You do know why I've called you here." **
[20-Jun-2013 01:12:10]  * Makoto yawns and idly scratches her left arm
[20-Jun-2013 01:12:33]  * Makoto gives Pyunpyun a blank look. "Uhm... why?"
[20-Jun-2013 01:12:39]  <Yui> "The pictures?"
[20-Jun-2013 01:13:36]  <IllFlower> "In a manner of speaking, maybe."
[20-Jun-2013 01:14:00]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun goes back to pacing, as if frustration as temporarily rendered him mute.
[20-Jun-2013 01:14:29]  <IllFlower> "You do remember what I said because of those pictures?" **
[20-Jun-2013 01:14:46]  <Makoto> "Pict- ...oh. Those pictures." Makoto suddenly seems, if not 100% herself again, at least considerably more alert.
[20-Jun-2013 01:15:11]  <Yui> "you said not to transform. not to risk exposure."
[20-Jun-2013 01:15:50]  <IllFlower> "And then not eight hours later, you..." **
[20-Jun-2013 01:16:12]  <Makoto> "We... we did it quietly though! And there was a witch! We couldn't just /let it/ keep doin' witchy stuff, right?!"
[20-Jun-2013 01:16:14]  <Yui> "But Pyunpyun! Yuna was in trouble! I couldn't just..." 
[20-Jun-2013 01:16:20]  * Yui trails off
[20-Jun-2013 01:16:50]  * Makoto mutters to herself 'yeaaahhhh. Blew that witch up reeeal quiet like...'
[20-Jun-2013 01:18:05]  <IllFlower> "She might have been in trouble, but I have enough faith that the other *three* would have handled themselves just fine, even if one of them was mildly incapacitated.
[20-Jun-2013 01:19:02]  <ponicalica> 14"mildly" pretty sure a -3 against a boss monster is pretty severe
[20-Jun-2013 01:19:28]  <IllFlower> "And, yes, it wasn't exactly *quiet*, but I'll ignore that for now, because it doesn't really matter how quietly you transformed and fought if indeed you transformed and fought." **
[20-Jun-2013 01:20:21]  <Makoto> "But we were really- I mean, we- ...hey, how did you...? -oh. Oh crap."
[20-Jun-2013 01:20:27]  <Yui> "because of pliable denausability, right?"
[20-Jun-2013 01:20:33]  <ponicalica> denausability?
[20-Jun-2013 01:20:41]  <ponicalica> 14crap, forgot the 14
[20-Jun-2013 01:20:48]  <Makoto> (PLIABLE denausability!)
[20-Jun-2013 01:21:15]  <Yui> "er, plausible deniability."
[20-Jun-2013 01:21:40]  <Yui> "or lack thereof as the case may be"
[20-Jun-2013 01:21:44]  <ponicalica> 14 think of how much fun we're going to have messing up Hikari Hiiragi's name
[20-Jun-2013 01:23:05]  <Snezana> (Who got a -3?)
[20-Jun-2013 01:23:15]  <Makoto> (think it was ponicalica's character)
[20-Jun-2013 01:23:23]  <Makoto> (Sumire. Thatssaone.)
[20-Jun-2013 01:23:49]  <IllFlower> "Yes, that. You don't get much of that firing cannons near busy seaports. Now, if we were talking about a non-magical adversary, we wouldn't have much problem, but it's very likely that the person trying to blackmail you would know exactly what made that cannon fire!"
[20-Jun-2013 01:24:06]  <ponicalica> 14it was Yuna
[20-Jun-2013 01:24:07]  <IllFlower> Who knew Pyunpyun could raise his voice? But that he does, rather chillingly.
[20-Jun-2013 01:24:10]  <IllFlower> **
[20-Jun-2013 01:24:14]  <ponicalica> 14she didn't have a flashlight
[20-Jun-2013 01:24:27]  <Snezana> (For want of a flashlight, a meguca was lost)
[20-Jun-2013 01:25:04]  <Makoto> "Well, allright, so then we... Hmm, but what if... Eh, no, maybe we oughta..."
[20-Jun-2013 01:25:27]  <Makoto> "Uh... Yui?"
[20-Jun-2013 01:26:09]  * Makoto tries to grin reassuringly, but just looks uneasy. Uneasy and tired.
[20-Jun-2013 01:26:11]  <Yui> yui has shrunk back into herself, shoulders slumped and eyes to the floor
[20-Jun-2013 01:26:35]  <Makoto> "U-uh oh gosh! W-wait, but-"
[20-Jun-2013 01:27:37]  <Makoto> "...man. We don't even know what this guy wants! Girl! Whatever!"
[20-Jun-2013 01:28:00]  <Makoto> "Uhm... but... you saw what we did to that witch, right? We can take 'em, I bet!"
[20-Jun-2013 01:28:06]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun shakes his head.
[20-Jun-2013 01:28:15]  * Makoto claps Yui on the shoulder, perhaps a bit more roughly than she intended.
[20-Jun-2013 01:28:43]  * Yui yelps, startled. "Maybe it's bigger than we can imagine Makoto."
[20-Jun-2013 01:28:49]  * Makoto still trying to look cheerful and failing miserably. The dark bags under her eyes aren't helping matters
[20-Jun-2013 01:29:24]  <Snezana> (didn't take long for things to get dark)
[20-Jun-2013 01:29:26]  <IllFlower> "Witches have no real intelligence, no intent. For that reason alone, they can be a thousand times less dangerous than one human with a goal.
[20-Jun-2013 01:29:53]  * Makoto laughs nervously "Heheheheh... I still got fight in me... I could take down a dozen more witches like that'n, easy! ...like to see 'em try..." *trails off*
[20-Jun-2013 01:30:27]  <Makoto> (^^^haha indeed)
[20-Jun-2013 01:31:02]  <IllFlower> "You can run from a witch just by getting far enough away. It's much harder to run from someone dead set on finding you." **
[20-Jun-2013 01:32:52]  <Makoto> "Well... whadda ya want us t'do 'bout it, anyway! Sumire was hurt! You can't know that the three of them would've been enough!" Makoto actually seems genuinely angry now, although she's trying to seem blustery and confident to hide it.
[20-Jun-2013 01:33:37]  <Makoto> "What good is just yelling at us gonna do, huh? What're we gonna do about this then. if you're so smart!
[20-Jun-2013 01:33:46]  <Makoto> *, if you're so smart!"
[20-Jun-2013 01:33:50]  <Yui> "So perhaps we didn't take the wisest course of action, maybe we put ourselves at a higher risk, but I don't think we could  run even if we wanted to."
[20-Jun-2013 01:34:50]  <IllFlower> "That's still no reason to make it easier," Pyunpyun retorts. **
[20-Jun-2013 01:36:17]  <Makoto> "Making sure my friends don't die fighting a witch is plenty reason enough for me!"
[20-Jun-2013 01:36:19]  <Yui> "I couldn't leave her. She's always been there. ALWAYS."
[20-Jun-2013 01:37:03]  <Yui> (illflower is a disgruntled parent of misbehaving teens: the rp)

[20-Jun-2013 01:40:22]  <Makoto> "Whadda you mean by... t-trading lives! Huh fuzzbutt?!" Even as Makoto says this, the terror in her eyes makes it all too clear she knows /exactly/ what Pyunpyun means.
[20-Jun-2013 01:41:38]  <Makoto> "C'mon! Don't talk stupid! No way any of us would let anybody else d- get hurt! No way!"

[20-Jun-2013 01:44:36]  * Makoto slumps down against a wall, finding herself barely able to stand upright. She scratches her arm again.
[20-Jun-2013 01:45:22]  <Yui> "It would seem that way. So what do we do now, Pyunpyun? Wait around and tremble and wait to die? Is that the master plan? Hunker down and let the fear win?"
[20-Jun-2013 01:45:43]  <IllFlower> (Oh, if only you could hear me mouthing the lines to myself to make sure they sound right. I'm starting to hyperventilate myself a little.)

[20-Jun-2013 01:47:25]  <IllFlower> "No, of course not. I have, to my mind, a better solution.

[20-Jun-2013 02:05:21]  <Makoto> gimme a sec here... okay yadda yadda, let's get outta here... RIGHT
[20-Jun-2013 02:05:31]  *** Nitya <~Glossina@174-25-59-69.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[20-Jun-2013 02:06:05]  * Makoto walks away from the building alongside Yui
[20-Jun-2013 02:06:23]  <IllFlower> I figure you two are doing the walk-and-talk through the streets?
[20-Jun-2013 02:06:30]  <Yui> "I need to think things out. That means baking. Want to come?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:06:50]  <Makoto> "Do I? /Your/ cooking? Hell yeah."
[20-Jun-2013 02:07:48]  * Yui laughs and squeezes Makoto's hand slightly and starts swinging their arms as they walk.
[20-Jun-2013 02:07:56]  <Makoto> "But really though. This'll probably be okay, right? I mean, we can take down witches easy by teaming up, right? And... let's say that whoever the creep is that's taking these pictures, let' say they're, iunno, another magical girl or whatever."
[20-Jun-2013 02:08:17]  <Makoto> "Like our evil arch nemesis or something. What, they gonna fight us two on one? We can take 'em, I bet."
[20-Jun-2013 02:08:32]  <Yui> "It'll be okay. The other girls will protect us, if we can't protect ourselves."

[20-Jun-2013 02:08:39]  <Makoto> "It'll be tougher than a witch, sure, but we can do it. I know we can."
[20-Jun-2013 02:08:56]  * Makoto sounds like she's trying to convince herself just as much as Yui, but she speaks with conviction.
[20-Jun-2013 02:09:02]  <Yui> "I'm not as sure as you. I wish I could be though."
[20-Jun-2013 02:09:17]  <Makoto> (er wait that makes no sense that was the wrong word aaaahhhhh)
[20-Jun-2013 02:09:40]  <Yui> "So do you think the stalker would leave us alone if we made them food?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:09:57]  <Makoto> "What, be me? Naaawwww, don't do that to yourself."
[20-Jun-2013 02:10:24]  <Yui> "I mean, if we're working with our strengths. Maybe I can fold their laundry really terribly and upset them"
[20-Jun-2013 02:10:31]  <Makoto> "Hey, if it's your cooking? I might actually believe that would work!"
[20-Jun-2013 02:10:54]  <Yui> "or give them directions to the grocery store and land them in a dump like Sumire did to Aoi"
[20-Jun-2013 02:11:03]  <Sumire> 14rude
[20-Jun-2013 02:11:13]  <IllFlower> bahahahahaha
[20-Jun-2013 02:11:18]  * Makoto lets go of Yui's hand for a second to briefly scratch her arm again
[20-Jun-2013 02:11:37]  <Nitya> 14and what a grocery store it was
[20-Jun-2013 02:12:12]  <Makoto> "Hahaha, yeah. That'd throw 'em off the trail. I'd like to see a stalker find their way out again after being given directions by Sumire!"
[20-Jun-2013 02:12:35]  <Sumire> 14ruuuuude
[20-Jun-2013 02:12:52]  <Makoto> (hella rudebrazen bro)
[20-Jun-2013 02:13:28]  <Yui> "so what kind of baked good would you like on this, our first evening of freedom?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:14:27]  <Makoto> (man whats those fishy lookin things. those things sound hella baller)
[20-Jun-2013 02:14:46]  <Yui> (the ones that Kyouko eats in Madoka?)
[20-Jun-2013 02:14:55]  <IllFlower> Taiyaki?
[20-Jun-2013 02:14:55]  <Makoto> (aye. the fishy lookin things)
[20-Jun-2013 02:15:01]  <Snezana> Taiyaki
[20-Jun-2013 02:15:02]  <Makoto> T-A-I-Y-A-K-I.
[20-Jun-2013 02:15:04]  <Snezana> also the food of uguu
[20-Jun-2013 02:15:10]  <Sumire> 14ta-i-ya-ki I think
[20-Jun-2013 02:15:23]  <Makoto> (pffff)
[20-Jun-2013 02:15:38]  <Yui> "haha, okay, but you have to help me mold them!"
[20-Jun-2013 02:16:15]  * Makoto flexes "gonna mold em like a boss"
[20-Jun-2013 02:17:13]  <Snezana> ((I wonder if that meme ever crossed into japan0)
[20-Jun-2013 02:21:33]  <Yui> "Is your arm okay? Do we need to pick up a generic corticosteroid cream when we go for groceries?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:21:35]  <Sumire> 14if not we can just say it was added by the fansubbers :p
[20-Jun-2013 02:22:17]  <Makoto> "Huh? My ar- oh yeah... nah I'm just tired I think... it's just been a little itchy since I blew up that witch. By the way, about that, was that awesome or what?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:22:18]  <Snezana> ((Magical burst as brought to you by commie))
[20-Jun-2013 02:22:58]  * Makoto still seems exhausted and a little out of it but almost her old cheerful self again
[20-Jun-2013 02:23:17]  <Sumire> 14even Funi threw in fanfiction references in Steins;Gate but that's because the characters being nerds is an important part of the story
[20-Jun-2013 02:24:02]  <Yui> "Totally awesome. People will be talking about it for dec--" Yui stops mid-sentence. "I guess we actually wouldn't want them doing that"
[20-Jun-2013 02:24:55]  <Makoto> "Yeah, but everybody who was there will be! Heh heh heh. Shoulda seen the looks on your faces..." *yawn*
[20-Jun-2013 02:25:23]  <Makoto> (okay IllFlower you may release the hounds whenever ready)
[20-Jun-2013 02:25:38]  <IllFlower> Roll call! Who else is here?
[20-Jun-2013 02:25:45]  <Snezana> Snezana reporting for megucing
[20-Jun-2013 02:26:03]  <Makoto> (Robot roll call!)

[20-Jun-2013 02:26:37]  <Makoto> (CROOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW)
[20-Jun-2013 02:26:52]  <Makoto> (sorry if i got those out of order ain't seen dat show in like ages)
[20-Jun-2013 02:26:52]  <IllFlower> Anyone else?
[20-Jun-2013 02:27:08]  <Sumire> 14here
[20-Jun-2013 02:27:10]  <Makoto> (just wanted to do the 'crooooowwwww' bit mostly B-))
[20-Jun-2013 02:27:46]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's just wing this.
[20-Jun-2013 02:28:09]  <Nitya> 14I'm half asleep, sorry.
[20-Jun-2013 02:28:31]  <IllFlower> Makoto and Yui are so occupied with their conversation that they nearly run straight into a few of their fellow initiates.
[20-Jun-2013 02:28:46]  * Snezana watches with a smirk as Sumire nearly collides with Makoto
[20-Jun-2013 02:29:11]  * Makoto sick dodges, [s]bro[/s] sis
[20-Jun-2013 02:29:12]  <IllFlower> Snezana: Pyunpyun hasn't mentioned anything to you since he met with you and Yui in front of the school. That's all.
[20-Jun-2013 02:29:35]  * Sumire jumps as she just barely misses colliding with Makoto
[20-Jun-2013 02:30:03]  <Makoto> "...yeah, and then we- oouuuaaaauhhhhhh. Oops! Hi Sumire!"
[20-Jun-2013 02:30:18]  <Snezana> "Yeah, its been awhile"
[20-Jun-2013 02:30:20]  <Sumire> "H-hello Makoto!  What's up?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:30:42]  <Snezana> ((I forgot was it me and Yui who first got the photo?))
[20-Jun-2013 02:30:49]  <Yui> ((yes))
[20-Jun-2013 02:30:56]  * Makoto glances at Yui, surprisingly subtly. "Not a lot!"
[20-Jun-2013 02:31:30]  <IllFlower> Snezana: Makoto did as well, but that was offscreen. (I actually don't remember if SpruceZeus was notified of that, but he seems to have played as if he was, so...)
[20-Jun-2013 02:31:48]  <Makoto> "Yui and I were just talking about how bad I kicked that last witch's butt!"
[20-Jun-2013 02:32:02]  <Sumire> "That's good.  I am wiped after getting Yuna's flashlight back.  I absolutely do not want to deal with all these fucking letters in this state."
[20-Jun-2013 02:32:12]  <Snezana> "... and made a racket so loud you woke me up"
[20-Jun-2013 02:32:19]  <Sumire> "What the hell is even C's purpose beyond confusing foreigners."
[20-Jun-2013 02:32:53]  * Snezana looks around over her shoulder
[20-Jun-2013 02:33:00]  <Sumire> 14sumire asks the hard-hitting questions
[20-Jun-2013 02:33:01]  <Makoto> "Uhm... is C the curvy one, or the squiggly one...?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:33:05]  <Snezana> Well Yui, can I talk to you in private
[20-Jun-2013 02:33:30]  <Yui> "Uhh, sure.  Sumire, Makoto, excuse me."
[20-Jun-2013 02:33:46]  <Makoto> "...okay... have fun!"
[20-Jun-2013 02:33:52]  <Sumire> "Alright."
[20-Jun-2013 02:34:02]  <Snezana> Alright, lets just get off to the side
[20-Jun-2013 02:34:25]  * Yui follows Snezana
[20-Jun-2013 02:34:43]  * Snezana goes in a back alley, her back against the entrance with her hand feeling around her pocket
[20-Jun-2013 02:34:48]  <Makoto> (I don't really have anything else important to say really so this can just be about Yui and Snezana now if nobody else cares)
[20-Jun-2013 02:34:56]  <Snezana> "Anything happen since you got the photo?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:34:56]  <Sumire> Presumably, Makoto and Sumire continue to talk about English letters, in a conversation I don't want to continue describing because it's pretty irrelevant.
[20-Jun-2013 02:35:58]  <Makoto> i have to go
[20-Jun-2013 02:36:23]  <Snezana> "As for me, I figure I need to ask p-pyou--the familiar some questions. And since you were there, I might as well level with you on something."
[20-Jun-2013 02:36:28]  <Yui> "Yeah, actually, despite what Makoto said. Pyunpyun has let us go as initiates, to protect the others, he said. Since we transformed and fought to get Yuna's flashlight back."
[20-Jun-2013 02:36:34]  *** Makoto is now known as SpruceZeus
[20-Jun-2013 02:36:37]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.90 [Firefox 21.0/20130511120803])
[20-Jun-2013 02:37:15]  <Snezana> "Everything with that work out? Yuna didn't witch out or anything, right?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:37:21]  <Snezana> "anyways..."
[20-Jun-2013 02:37:41]  <IllFlower> Yui: There's some more stuff after this conversation, by the way, so hold on for that.
[20-Jun-2013 02:37:47]  <Yui> "everyone seems to be recovering okay, yeah. But as you were saying"
[20-Jun-2013 02:37:56]  <Yui> (Okay)
[20-Jun-2013 02:37:57]  * Snezana takes out a switchblade from her pocket, a small butterfly knife, "Well listen, I heard that you dealt with someone who was using a witch or something right?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:38:11]  * Snezana pockets the knife
[20-Jun-2013 02:38:15]  <IllFlower> Would have been for Makoto too, but we can proceed without SpruceZeus if we must. >_>
[20-Jun-2013 02:38:36]  <Sumire> 14what about me?  Is Sumire done and going to stay ignorant of the event of the episode?
[20-Jun-2013 02:39:01]  <Snezana> "Straight to the point, I'm being watched by -something- and it isn't a witch, and I figure... oh shit how can I explain this..."
[20-Jun-2013 02:39:14]  <Snezana> "You know how I said that initiates in the old country didn't trust each other?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:39:40]  <IllFlower> Sumire: I don't know, that's up to Yui.
[20-Jun-2013 02:40:02]  <IllFlower> I plan to fill the remaining initiates in sooner or later, though.
[20-Jun-2013 02:40:18]  <Yui> "Yeah, that seemed weird, especially since we're all so close here. Were you being watched and followed before you came here??"
[20-Jun-2013 02:40:59]  <Snezana> "Well, it was the war, people were paranoid and... some people used their power in a bad way
[20-Jun-2013 02:41:01]  <Snezana> really bad way
[20-Jun-2013 02:41:19]  <Sumire> 14srebenica: magical girl edition
[20-Jun-2013 02:41:53]  * Snezana 's eyes defocus, as if trying to force her way through a memory
[20-Jun-2013 02:42:23]  <Snezana> "B-but you had these group of initiates, called themselves the White Dove who used their powers to help people. They were from all different countries."
[20-Jun-2013 02:42:51]  <Snezana> "l-lets just say we didn't see eye to eye, but they needed me to do something, and I did it- I think I did it, I wrote that I did it
[20-Jun-2013 02:43:18]  * Yui shifts slightly and perks up a bit, but remains silent, surprised at how much Snezana has shared compared to her usual shortness
[20-Jun-2013 02:43:33]  <Snezana> "Look they needed me to do something 
[20-Jun-2013 02:43:46]  <Snezana> I needed to kill someone. They were killing my people
[20-Jun-2013 02:43:55]  * Snezana suddenly shouts MY PEOPLE
[20-Jun-2013 02:44:14]  * Yui jumps back, startled
[20-Jun-2013 02:44:16]  <Snezana> "And so I killed him, I think I killed him. Then they told me how I died, the fuckers backstabbed me"
[20-Jun-2013 02:44:27]  <IllFlower> ("MY PEOPLE ARE YOU ALL IN THE HOUSE" "YEEEAAAAH")
[20-Jun-2013 02:44:40]  <Snezana> (You granola motherfucker)
[20-Jun-2013 02:44:53]  <Snezana> "So I left, so I think that
[20-Jun-2013 02:45:00]  <Snezana> maybe I didn't kill him after all
[20-Jun-2013 02:45:13]  <Yui> "Told you how you died? Like a cover story?"
[20-Jun-2013 02:45:15]  <Snezana> And he came all the way out -here- to try and get me, I thought I was safe
[20-Jun-2013 02:45:36]  <Snezana> "Look I don't remember what they told me, okay? You can't make me remember"
[20-Jun-2013 02:45:52]  <Snezana> "They fucking knew the entire time and they waited until then... anyways
[20-Jun-2013 02:45:58]  * Snezana puts her hands on her own face, sweating
[20-Jun-2013 02:46:26]  <Snezana> "This guy we called him the scorcher, he would fry people's brains, initiates, normals, it didn't matter, and he was hard to kill, people said he could fake his death
[20-Jun-2013 02:46:35]  * Yui reaches a hand out towards Snezana, stepping forward
[20-Jun-2013 02:46:39]  <Snezana> so they needed me, since I had powers over the 'void', they needed me--
[20-Jun-2013 02:46:48]  * Snezana suddenly slaps it aside, looking wild eyed
[20-Jun-2013 02:46:54]  <Snezana> "S-sorry, shit, sorry"
[20-Jun-2013 02:46:57]  <Yui> "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..."
[20-Jun-2013 02:47:33]  <Snezana> "Look, all I'm saying is that he may be here and that your familiar is looking to... cut you off to minimize damages"
[20-Jun-2013 02:47:45]  <Snezana> "So watch your back, okay? Wouldn't want anything to happen."
[20-Jun-2013 02:47:53]  <Sumire> 14from bullies to Balkan war criminals.  what a story
[20-Jun-2013 02:48:04]  * Snezana hears Sumire
[20-Jun-2013 02:48:16]  <IllFlower> (That was OOC.)
[20-Jun-2013 02:48:21]  <Snezana> "I didn't tell her much, but what I told you about killing someone doesn't get shared."
[20-Jun-2013 02:48:53]  <Snezana> "Just tell them that there might be someone here who wants to get even with me and that they shouldn't get involved. I'll handle this."
[20-Jun-2013 02:48:54]  <Yui> "Okay. Understood. Thank you, for trusting. That must have been hard."
[20-Jun-2013 02:49:14]  <Snezana> "When you're desperate, a-and look I think he's been watching me so I know he knows how to watch youy
[20-Jun-2013 02:49:34]  <Snezana> And this fucker isn't going to hesitate to do something like use someone you care about against you
[20-Jun-2013 02:49:50]  <Snezana> So if anything happens, you come to me, and I'll make sure you stay safe, okay? I'll make sure everyone stays safe
[20-Jun-2013 02:50:07]  <Snezana> Now i got to go see the familiar and see if I can get some things... clarified
[20-Jun-2013 02:50:28]  * Snezana looks around nervously, then puts her hand back in her pocket and walks towards the abandoned building at a fast pace
[20-Jun-2013 02:50:29]  <Yui> "I will. I promise. Stay safe yourself. I won't tell the others anything more than what you said I could."
[20-Jun-2013 02:51:40]  * Yui walks back over to Sumire
[20-Jun-2013 02:52:43]  <Snezana> (I always get really nervous about my RP'ing)
[20-Jun-2013 02:52:50]  * Sumire notices Yui walking towards her
[20-Jun-2013 02:53:01]  <IllFlower> Snezana: You did a great job.
[20-Jun-2013 02:53:10]  <Yui> ((You really did.))
[20-Jun-2013 02:53:16]  <Sumire> 14yeah, you did really well.

[20-Jun-2013 02:56:51]  <IllFlower> I have a feeling Snezana's going to try tearing Pyunpyun apart limb from limb to demand an explanation of what's going on instead, haha
[20-Jun-2013 02:57:02]  <Sumire> "Absolutely.  I'm starving."
[20-Jun-2013 02:57:19]  <Snezana> ((can we cover the meeting))
[20-Jun-2013 02:57:29]  <Yui> ((are we supposed to follow snezana?))
[20-Jun-2013 02:57:41]  <IllFlower> Snezana: Yeah, but it'll have to wait until next episode, probably.
[20-Jun-2013 02:57:58]  <Snezana> ((you could try to sneak on to figure whats going on))
[20-Jun-2013 02:59:09]  <IllFlower> Yui?
[20-Jun-2013 02:59:59]  <Yui> (is that confirmation to snoop?)
[20-Jun-2013 03:00:47]  <IllFlower> You can do what you think suits her character.
[20-Jun-2013 03:02:09]  <Yui> Then we're leaving her to her privacy because Yui's still thrown by sudden exposition and still needs to process
[20-Jun-2013 03:02:27]  <IllFlower> All right.
[20-Jun-2013 03:02:47]  <IllFlower> Snezana: We'll pick up with your scene next session. That all right?
[20-Jun-2013 03:02:52]  <Snezana> sure
[20-Jun-2013 03:03:17]  <Yui> Next session is on my parents' anniversary so I don't know to what degree I'll be around
[20-Jun-2013 03:03:28]  <IllFlower> Okay, then, Yui, Sumire, and Makoto make tracks for Yui's place.
[20-Jun-2013 03:03:59]  <IllFlower> Sometimes there's little more fearsome than three hungry teenage girls.
[20-Jun-2013 03:04:54]  <IllFlower> Fast-forward a little while, and Yui and Sumire are in the kitchen doing prep work.
[20-Jun-2013 03:05:03]  <IllFlower> Banter? y/n
[20-Jun-2013 03:05:12]  <Sumire> 14Yui, what do you think?

[20-Jun-2013 03:10:19]  <IllFlower> Yui: If Yui's doing this, then she won't be involved in the next episode anyway far as I can see, so it's not too big a deal.
[20-Jun-2013 03:10:45]  <Yui> "Oh fun! Did you enjoy showing her around?
[20-Jun-2013 03:12:12]  <Sumire> "It was nice to walk around with her, yeah.  It's weird how little we know about her, though."
[20-Jun-2013 03:13:52]  <Yui> "Maybe she'll open up in time. I think she's still on edge and doesn't quite trust us yet."

[20-Jun-2013 03:16:17]  <Sumire> "Probably.  How about you and Makoto?  Was it just food that brought you two together?"
[20-Jun-2013 03:17:31]  <Yui> "It always comes down to food  with her, but no. Remember how Pyunpyun told us we weren't supposed to transform and we did anyway?"
[20-Jun-2013 03:18:53]  <Sumire> "Yeah.  To get the flashlight back.  Nobody could have seen us, though; that place seemed pretty empty to me."
[20-Jun-2013 03:19:28]  <Yui> "That's what we thought too, but Pyunpyun was FURIOUS."
[20-Jun-2013 03:19:43]  <Yui> ((so furious I am not punning))
[20-Jun-2013 03:20:07]  <IllFlower> Not very fast, though.
[20-Jun-2013 03:20:35]  <Yui> ((ba dum tiss))
[20-Jun-2013 03:21:09]  <Sumire> "Furious?  What did he do?"
[20-Jun-2013 03:23:08]  <Yui> "Makoto's trying to play it off like nothing is wrong, and maybe it isn't, but she's resting and can't tell me not to tell you. Pyunpyun decided it was in the best interests of everyone to sever our ties to him as initiates under his care."
[20-Jun-2013 03:23:47]  <Yui> "I don't even particularly know what that means yet. Just that I'm without a familiar with somebody taking pictures and leaving them in my locker at school"
[20-Jun-2013 03:25:46]  <Sumire> "Well, it's not like he helped that much when we were dealing with Kei or Kaede.  And hey, you still have us.  We'll protect you."
[20-Jun-2013 03:26:14]  <IllFlower> Yui's mother calls from outside the front door. "Yui? Can you help me for a second?" **
[20-Jun-2013 03:26:34]  <Yui> "Sure, mom! Be right there!"
[20-Jun-2013 03:27:43]  <IllFlower> As Yui opens the front door of their house, she notices, across the street, a boy about her age walking down the opposite sidewalk.
[20-Jun-2013 03:28:11]  *** Lin_Chong <webchat@101.85.214.198> has joined #madokamadness
[20-Jun-2013 03:28:23]  <IllFlower> This strikes her as unusual for a few reasons, but not least because the boy is talking to a dog-like creature that's walking next to him.
[20-Jun-2013 03:29:01]  <Sumire> 14duh duh duuuuuuh
[20-Jun-2013 03:29:03]  <IllFlower> Oh, and the creature's responding to him, no less. **

[20-Jun-2013 03:31:06]  <Yui> ((:o))
[20-Jun-2013 03:32:39]  <IllFlower> Any response other than stunned silence? :p
[20-Jun-2013 03:33:25]  * Yui cocks her head in confusion. Another familiar? Another magical /boy/? Maybe it's just a talking dog and I'm actually in an anime, she thinks to herself.
[20-Jun-2013 03:34:02]  <IllFlower> Oh, Yui never met Shun, that's right...
[20-Jun-2013 03:34:57]  <Yui> ((should she call for Sumire?))
[20-Jun-2013 03:35:23]  <Sumire> 14well as far as the familiars go, the only even mention of another familiar is that Kaede mentioned a Mizu-chin to Aoi
[20-Jun-2013 03:35:56]  <IllFlower> The boy's eyes catch Yui standing in the doorway of her house as she stares back at him. He waves in puzzlement at first, then seems to figure something out and points at the creature with a sort of confirmatory gesture, as if to ask "You see it?" **
[20-Jun-2013 03:36:21]  * Yui nods fervently
[20-Jun-2013 03:37:25]  <IllFlower> He makes another gesture, this time meaning "Do you want to talk?" **
[20-Jun-2013 03:37:57]  * Yui nods, steps through the door frame and quietly shuts the door behind her.
[20-Jun-2013 03:38:52]  * Yui starts off towards unknown boy
[20-Jun-2013 03:40:26]  <IllFlower> Upon closer inspection, the boy appears... surprisingly short. Definitely not Aoi's height. Maybe Yuna's. He wears glasses, has rather unremarkable short hair.
[20-Jun-2013 03:40:52]  <IllFlower> "It's rare to meet another initiate like this," he says, smiling. **

[20-Jun-2013 03:42:11]  <Anonus> Hello
[20-Jun-2013 03:42:18]  <Sumire> 14there's an RP going on Anonus
[20-Jun-2013 03:42:47]  <IllFlower> "Hiroaki. First-name basis, huh?" He laughs.
[20-Jun-2013 03:43:24]  <IllFlower> "I don't live too far from here. I go on walks sometimes with Asacchi."
[20-Jun-2013 03:44:04]  <Yui> "Dangerously casual is a fun way to live. Pleased to make your acquaintance, Hirosaki."
[20-Jun-2013 03:44:19]  <IllFlower> Asacchi, the assumed familiar, speaks up. "Hi. It's nice to meet you, Yui." Distinctly feminine voice, unlike Pyunpyun's boyish one. **
[20-Jun-2013 03:44:35]  <IllFlower> "Same," Hiroaki says. **
[20-Jun-2013 03:46:11]  <Yui> ((do you know how much fidgeting I'm doing irl right now help how do I interact with boys??? IGNORE THEM AND TALK TO THE FAMILIAR))
[20-Jun-2013 03:46:48]  <IllFlower> ("Uuuuummm, uhhhh, uhhhhh - ASACCHI ARE YOU RECRUITING")
[20-Jun-2013 03:47:35]  <Yui> "Aoyama, if you'd prefer. How long have you been" Yui points between Asacchi and Hiroaki
[20-Jun-2013 03:50:26]  <Saladofstones> (Uhh I HAVE LEGS YOUR PRETTY)
[20-Jun-2013 03:50:41]  <IllFlower> "Together?" He laughs again, recognizing the parallels. "A couple of years." **

[20-Jun-2013 03:54:03]  <Yui> "Wow, that's a long time." Yui smiles and inwardly scolds herself for sounding like an idiot and shifts from foot to foot. "I'm sorry, it sounds like I'm going to ask when you're planning on getting married next, doesn't it?"
[20-Jun-2013 03:57:38]  <IllFlower> "Well, it is just the two of us now." **
[20-Jun-2013 04:01:22]  <IllFlower> Yui?
[20-Jun-2013 04:01:24]  <Yui> "Oh." Yui looks down where Asacchi had been, and quickly recovers, blushing slightly, "so it is..." ((I AM SO BAD AT CONVERSATION RN))
[20-Jun-2013 04:01:35]  <Sumire> 14apparently she's blushing in real life too
[20-Jun-2013 04:01:49]  <IllFlower> Hahahahaha.
[20-Jun-2013 04:01:52]  <Yui> ((NOBODY ASKED YOU PONI))
[20-Jun-2013 04:02:16]  <Nitya> 14i picked a good time to glance back at this channel
[20-Jun-2013 04:02:33]  <Yui> ((NO YOU DIDN'T THERE IS NOTHING TO SEE))
[20-Jun-2013 04:03:55]  <IllFlower> "Yeah, some moved away, some got 'transferred' to other familiars, a couple, uh... we lost them. About nine months ago..."
[20-Jun-2013 04:04:29]  <Nitya> 14"maternity leave, you know"
[20-Jun-2013 04:04:45]  <IllFlower> Hiroaki stops himself. "Sorry, you probably don't want to hear about that right now. But for better or worse, I made it through two years, and now here I am.
[20-Jun-2013 04:04:53]  <IllFlower> "So what about you? Who are you with?" **
[20-Jun-2013 04:06:12]  <Yui> "A group of friends. Wait, transferring familiars, how does that work?"
[20-Jun-2013 04:06:28]  <IllFlower> Nitya: That is some Mai-Otome levels of disturbing right there.
[20-Jun-2013 04:06:37]  <Nitya> 14you're welcome
[20-Jun-2013 04:07:33]  <Alicia> (Great time to glance back.)
[20-Jun-2013 04:07:47]  <IllFlower> Yui: "Oh, no, I meant... well - whatever. It's like transferring jobs at a company, I guess. I never really asked about it too much." **
[20-Jun-2013 04:08:05]  <IllFlower> er, more -
[20-Jun-2013 04:08:49]  <IllFlower> Asacchi chips in. "Sometimes initiates swap familiars, or sometimes familiars trade initiates. It's mostly just to find the right fit." **
[20-Jun-2013 04:09:32]  <Yui> "Oh, you meant-" Yui sstraightens out her arm with her palm parallel to the ground, miming patting something around knee height
[20-Jun-2013 04:09:55]  <Yui> "Oh, thank you for the explaination!"
[20-Jun-2013 04:09:58]  <IllFlower> Hiroaki nods. **
[20-Jun-2013 04:12:41]  <Yui> "It's complicated. Well, not necessarily complicated complicated, but complicated."
[20-Jun-2013 04:13:04]  <IllFlower> Now he makes a somewhat confused face. **
[20-Jun-2013 04:14:12]  <Yui> "I don't really have one at the moment. I'm a free agent."
[20-Jun-2013 04:14:30]  <Yui> "for you know, certain degrees of free"
[20-Jun-2013 04:14:54]  <IllFlower> "Huh." Hiroaki raises his eyebrows. "I didn't think that was a thing that happened around these parts." **
[20-Jun-2013 04:17:07]  * Yui kicks at the ground, shuffling her feet. "Well, glad to help update your data banks"
[20-Jun-2013 04:17:32]  <IllFlower> "Do you mind if I ask what happened?" **
[20-Jun-2013 04:19:34]  <Yui> Yui sighs. "I do, kinda, actually. I'm still working it out for myself. I should probably go back to see what my mom wanted, and leaving my friends wasn't very good idea. The kitchen is probably a disaster by now. Maybe another time? You said you lived nearby?"

[20-Jun-2013 04:22:03]  <IllFlower> Hiroaki looks back at Yui's house. "It was nice meeting you. Don't let me keep you for too long. See you again soon?" **
[20-Jun-2013 04:23:01]  <Yui> Yui smiles shyly, "Definitely. Thanks for stopping to talk, Hiroaki."
[20-Jun-2013 04:23:53]  <IllFlower> (Did I accidentally introduce a love interest or something? hahaha)
[20-Jun-2013 04:24:10]  <Sumire> 14possibly.  the fanbase will go ballistic.
[20-Jun-2013 04:24:38]  <IllFlower> And scene.
[20-Jun-2013 04:24:49]  <IllFlower> Okay, that's all I have planned for tonight. Any questions?
