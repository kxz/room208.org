[13-Jan-2013 23:09:20]  <IllFlower> here's the stage: Aoi, Sumire, and Miaka are walking back home after school. original, I know.
[13-Jan-2013 23:09:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((whoa, I have /friends/))
[13-Jan-2013 23:09:58]  <IllFlower> you're all loose acquaintances, so you're having some idle chit-chat with each other.
[13-Jan-2013 23:10:10]  <IllFlower> (note to self: put Miaka's relationships down on the sheet.)
[13-Jan-2013 23:10:34]  <Miaka_Watanabe> Miaka's looking disheveled, as usual.Keeping to herself, mostly, though still contributing. ((quotes will obviously have "these" around them))
[13-Jan-2013 23:10:52]  <IllFlower> it seems like term exams are coming up, so that's everyone's primary concern...
[13-Jan-2013 23:11:25]  <IllFlower> **
[13-Jan-2013 23:11:26]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "Yeah, gonna have to stay off Core Armor Five for a while."
[13-Jan-2013 23:11:32]  <Sumire> So what are you guys' toughest subjects?  For me it's English!  How do these people put up with all the weird variant spellings of anything?
[13-Jan-2013 23:12:00]  *** ponicalica <~william@2607:f010:2ba:2:21c:25ff:febc:692> has left #madokamadness
[13-Jan-2013 23:12:01]  <Aoi> Aw, I was just gonna ask if you were any good at that. I can't figure out that gee eitch thing...
[13-Jan-2013 23:12:46]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "It seems like memorization, mostly. Which sucks because they keep pushing this whole 'rules' thing on us..."
[13-Jan-2013 23:13:06]  <IllFlower> ("Tanaka, please spell 'thoracogastroschisis'.")
[13-Jan-2013 23:13:40]  <Aoi> Boring, boring, so very boring!
[13-Jan-2013 23:14:21]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "At least I can like, try to read out game names on the internet, to practice...though if I'm doing that, then I'm not studying hard enough, and then...well..."
[13-Jan-2013 23:14:22]  * Aoi jogs ahead of the girls, and does a little jump 180 to get walking backwards
[13-Jan-2013 23:15:18]  <IllFlower> just as he turns around, Aoi notices a small, house pet-like figure following behind Sumire and Miaka.
[13-Jan-2013 23:15:24]  <Aoi> Miaka, you're good at math, aren't you?  I heard you aced the last final.  Any chance you could tutor a hardworking guy like me...?
[13-Jan-2013 23:15:35]  <Aoi> !
[13-Jan-2013 23:15:42]  <Sumire> What is it, Aoi?
[13-Jan-2013 23:15:51]  * Miaka_Watanabe looks up, confused
[13-Jan-2013 23:15:56]  <IllFlower> it's Pyunpyun, of course, wearing his usual nonchalant smile.
[13-Jan-2013 23:16:18]  <Sumire> 14also, did Aoi make that one noise from Metal Gear?
[13-Jan-2013 23:16:20]  <IllFlower> "fancy meeting you guys here!" he says.

[13-Jan-2013 23:16:38]  <Sumire> ...it's you again?  How often is this going to be?
[13-Jan-2013 23:16:40]  * Aoi looks a bit sorrowful
[13-Jan-2013 23:16:47]  <Aoi> Pyunpyun, you're not good at math at all.
[13-Jan-2013 23:16:53]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((expletives, as if the noun were a verb))

[13-Jan-2013 23:17:27]  <IllFlower> "now, now, is that any way to speak to your employer, Sumire?" **
[13-Jan-2013 23:17:46]  * Aoi cocks his head.  "You get paid?"
[13-Jan-2013 23:18:12]  * Miaka_Watanabe looks kind of frustrated. "This better be quick, Pyun', we have finals soon..."
[13-Jan-2013 23:18:36]  <Sumire> ...I don't think I get paid.  It's probably just Pyunpyun being really weird.  He talked about legally binding shit or something before I became a magical girl, so I dunno
[13-Jan-2013 23:18:43]  <IllFlower> Aoi: "I take offense at that! just yesterday I was reading a book about the... Fluffyair transformation!" **
[13-Jan-2013 23:19:04]  <Sumire> 14hahaha, fluffyair? XD
[13-Jan-2013 23:19:33]  * Miaka_Watanabe remains frustrated-looking.

[13-Jan-2013 23:20:01]  * Aoi resumes smiling.  "Pyunpyun, I think you need to discipline your employees more.  All this language!  It's unfitting for the cute mascots of your... whatever Fluffyairs do."
[13-Jan-2013 23:21:04]  <IllFlower> "of course it's the one male initiate of mine who has delicate ears..."
[13-Jan-2013 23:21:31]  <Aoi> "Ehehehee."
[13-Jan-2013 23:21:52]  * Miaka_Watanabe repeats herself, irked. "Are we supposed to do something, or what?"
[13-Jan-2013 23:22:15]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun looks up at the sky. "well, anyway, that doesn't really matter. I'm here because I've been getting some... vibes." **
[13-Jan-2013 23:22:35]  <Sumire> "Vibes? Like a witch?" 14Metal Gear?
[13-Jan-2013 23:22:52]  * Aoi glares.  "Is this about the pants again?"
[13-Jan-2013 23:23:00]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "Better be a witch, at this rate..."
[13-Jan-2013 23:23:40]  <IllFlower> "Aoi, weren't you just chastising someone else for language? now you're talking about someone's underwear..."
[13-Jan-2013 23:24:06]  * Miaka_Watanabe checks her phone for the time.
[13-Jan-2013 23:24:16]  <Aoi> "Wh-"
[13-Jan-2013 23:24:17]  <IllFlower> lol. patient, aren't we.
[13-Jan-2013 23:24:27]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((characterization! or something))
[13-Jan-2013 23:25:01]  <Sumire> I'm pretty sure Pyunpyun messes with our phones' watches, Miaka.  At least, when I checked mine after the last time he sent me off to fight a witch, it told me it was 2038.
[13-Jan-2013 23:25:21]  <IllFlower> "okay, I get it, you're busy. I'll skip the explanation. why don't the three of you follow me?"
[13-Jan-2013 23:25:43]  *** AttObl is now known as AttObl|FNV
[13-Jan-2013 23:26:13]  <Aoi> "Sure, sure.  Maybe I can ask the witches about English, it's pretty much the same as German, right?"
[13-Jan-2013 23:26:43]  <Miaka_Watanabe> Watanabe follows. "Better be, Sumire. I like to get in a half hour on the Box at home before I do any 'work', and this is pushing it back..."
[13-Jan-2013 23:27:05]  <Sumire> I think you might actually get a better read out of them than our teacher, who I think is pretty much only here because he likes that "Eva" thing.
[13-Jan-2013 23:27:32]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun proceeds to walk off towards a nearby high-rise building, not bothering to check whether anyone is actually following him. **
[13-Jan-2013 23:27:58]  * Sumire follows, occasionally turning back to check for Miaka and Aoi
[13-Jan-2013 23:28:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((oy! I followed /first/!))
[13-Jan-2013 23:28:15]  <Aoi> "Nerds, nerds.   Such disgusting people." Aoi mutters before following whoever may be.
[13-Jan-2013 23:30:01]  <IllFlower> "apparently, a few office workers have tried to commit suicide by jumping from here over the past month or so," Pyunpyun says, looking up at the top of the building as everyone approaches. "well, when it's just one or two, you can never tell if it's a witch or just a probabilistic hiccup, but... five?"
[13-Jan-2013 23:30:55]  <Sumire> 14it's just like my kara no kyoukais
[13-Jan-2013 23:30:58]  * Miaka_Watanabe looks mildly disturbed.

[13-Jan-2013 23:34:10]  <IllFlower> there's a long list of occupants visible next to the elevator. seems like the tower's got multiple tenants.
[13-Jan-2013 23:34:26]  * Aoi twists in. Not like he couldn't talk his way away from a security inspection, anyway.
[13-Jan-2013 23:34:37]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "...Maybe we can just walk in without looking too weird..." Miaka follows Aoi.
[13-Jan-2013 23:34:37]  * Sumire follows in behind Aoi
[13-Jan-2013 23:35:29]  <IllFlower> curiously, the receptionist, security guard, and occasional office worker filing through the lobby don't even seem to notice that there are three school-age girls and a... Pyunpyun walking amongst them.

[13-Jan-2013 23:36:07]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "Aoi," Miaka hisses, "let's just take what we can get and move on..."

[13-Jan-2013 23:36:15]  <IllFlower> Mr. Dancer.
[13-Jan-2013 23:36:18]  <Sumire> Weird.  It's like they don't even notice we're here at all.  Maybe they assume we're just somebody's kids, bringing their dad mom's cooking?
[13-Jan-2013 23:36:25]  <Aoi> 14Oh boy!
[13-Jan-2013 23:36:27]  <IllFlower> no, just kidding.

[13-Jan-2013 23:38:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "I keep forgetting how big this thing is," Miaka mutters.
[13-Jan-2013 23:38:18]  <IllFlower> "in any case, you can't fight probabilistic hiccups, so let's hope there's a witch for you three to dispose of." **
[13-Jan-2013 23:38:29]  <Sumire> Let me guess, there actually is a floor four and it's a secret witch hideout?

[13-Jan-2013 23:40:36]  <IllFlower> a "blong" echoes through the lobby as the elevator arrives. a middle-aged woman steps out of the elevator, bumping into Aoi on the way out. she blinks curiously, then walks off with a confused look. **
[13-Jan-2013 23:40:58]  <Sumire> Okay, that was even weirder.  Pyunpyun, are we invisible?
[13-Jan-2013 23:41:06]  * Sumire walks into the elevator
[13-Jan-2013 23:41:16]  * Miaka_Watanabe looks confused for a second, joins in the elevator.
[13-Jan-2013 23:41:16]  <IllFlower> "that's a silly question. can't you see yourself?"
[13-Jan-2013 23:41:17]  <Aoi> "Ah, excuse you!" Aoi chuckles quietly before getting in.  Unnoticeability sure is fun!

[14-Jan-2013 00:24:54]  <Fiora> it's true, he's really super tall, so your version would be even more extreme

[14-Jan-2013 00:39:06]  <Aoi> hardly, it's supposed to be for that thing i showed barcode and iverum before.
[14-Jan-2013 00:39:24]  <Barcode> I was wondering about that, actually. Seems my suspicions are correct.
[14-Jan-2013 00:39:35]  <Barcode> that's on my list of things to draw shit for.
[14-Jan-2013 00:39:40]  <Aoi> :D
[14-Jan-2013 00:39:57]  <Aoi> I wanted to ask BGTB about the precise operation of an AK-74, but he's not here and also I didn't get that far anyway.
[14-Jan-2013 00:40:01]  <Barcode> should I make miaka the only 16 year old in our group
[14-Jan-2013 00:40:08]  <Aoi> yes

[14-Jan-2013 00:40:37]  <Aoi> oh hey bgtb
[14-Jan-2013 00:40:52]  <Aoi> so, what firing modes does an AK have
[14-Jan-2013 00:40:52]  <BGTB2005> I'm pretty sure the AK-74 uses the same long-stroke gas piston with rotating bolt system as the AKM

[14-Jan-2013 00:41:03]  <Aoi> okay see I don't know what that means >_>
[14-Jan-2013 00:41:12]  <Aoi> i was just wondering if you could burst fire it
[14-Jan-2013 00:41:13]  <Barcode> firing modes, like, auto, semi, and burst you mean?
[14-Jan-2013 00:41:15]  <BGTB2005> From top to bottom, the lever on select-fire models goes safe - auto - semi
[14-Jan-2013 00:41:17]  <Aoi> instead of full auto
[14-Jan-2013 00:41:46]  <BGTB2005> If you know what you're doing, you can get bursts with either semi- or full-auto
[14-Jan-2013 00:41:56]  <Aoi> oh, ok.
[14-Jan-2013 00:42:05]  <Aoi> i was just thinking about how this person in the story would be using an AK
[14-Jan-2013 00:42:30]  <Aoi> full on automatic spray doesn't seem appropriate for killing just some guy you see
[14-Jan-2013 00:42:30]  <Barcode> Well, you can assume semi at range, auto up close. Being trained she probably prefers semi unless she's clearing a building or there's a lot of them.
[14-Jan-2013 00:42:33]  <BGTB2005> If they're professional military, probably short bursts of automatic or single shots
[14-Jan-2013 00:42:41]  <Aoi> yeah short bursts is what i was thinking
[14-Jan-2013 00:42:56]  <Aoi> or single shots.  see i didn't know that was possible >_>
[14-Jan-2013 00:43:02]  <Aoi> >_____> is me and guns all the way
[14-Jan-2013 00:43:15]  <Barcode> eh, just keep in mind Bullets Hurt People A Lot and you'll get why people just single-fire
[14-Jan-2013 00:43:15]  <BGTB2005> Is it for the RP?
[14-Jan-2013 00:43:24]  <Aoi> no, just my own stuff.
[14-Jan-2013 00:43:39]  <Aoi> Barcode: no i know /why/ you'd single fire, just didn't know that you could.
[14-Jan-2013 00:43:45]  <Barcode> ah. really, huh :o
[14-Jan-2013 00:43:56]  <Barcode> well, yeah, anyway. you can.
[14-Jan-2013 00:44:17]  <Aoi> wait why the face
[14-Jan-2013 00:44:22]  <BGTB2005> Most self-loading small arms have semi-auto fire modes
[14-Jan-2013 00:44:26]  <Barcode> Eh, I assumed it was more common knowledge
[14-Jan-2013 00:44:30]  <Barcode> some guns can do all three, old ones either only do bolt action or full auto, the burst fire thing is largely a newer guns thing.
[14-Jan-2013 00:44:41]  <Aoi> i am familiar with basics of firearm combat, such as "full automatic spray isn't that accurate"
[14-Jan-2013 00:44:42]  <Barcode> newer --> starting with, probably, vietnam

[14-Jan-2013 00:46:38]  <IllFlower> okay, when we left off, Pyunpyun was busy laughing at the idea of invisibility...
[14-Jan-2013 00:47:44]  <IllFlower> the three initiates file into the elevator. Pyunpyun climbs up the wall and stands over the topmost floor button, which he pushes rather carelessly.
[14-Jan-2013 00:48:21]  <IllFlower> the doors close, and the elevator starts rising. **
[14-Jan-2013 00:48:42]  <Aoi> "Pyunpyun, are you some kind of gecko sharktopus?"
[14-Jan-2013 00:49:00]  * Miaka_Watanabe looks around uneasily, largely at the ceiling.
[14-Jan-2013 00:49:09]  <IllFlower> Aoi: "a what?"
[14-Jan-2013 00:49:31]  <Aoi> "A gecko sharktopus.  Like a gecko, crossed with a sharktopus.  Since you climbed the wall, see?"
[14-Jan-2013 00:49:54]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun walks to the top of the wall, then leaps over to the ceiling, dangling on top of Miaka.
[14-Jan-2013 00:50:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((above?))
[14-Jan-2013 00:50:35]  * Miaka_Watanabe kind of instinctively flinches downwards, then stands up straighter.
[14-Jan-2013 00:50:44]  <IllFlower> "I don't know what any of those are, Aoi. are those kinds of food?"
[14-Jan-2013 00:51:01]  <Aoi> "Well, maybe.  I've never eaten gecko.  Dunno what they'd taste like."
[14-Jan-2013 00:51:06]  <Sumire> They're animals.  I guess you could probably eat them as food, but it's probably illegal according to some treaty Japan doesn't actually follow anyways
[14-Jan-2013 00:51:08]  <Aoi> "Are you saying you want to be eaten?"
[14-Jan-2013 00:51:19]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "Can you...sense anything right now, Pyun'?"
[14-Jan-2013 00:51:21]  <IllFlower> "you're the one who said I looked like food." **
[14-Jan-2013 00:52:32]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((hotline miami's nightmare music: appropriate?)

[14-Jan-2013 00:53:23]  <IllFlower> a noticeable tension fills the elevator car as it comes to a juddering stop.
[14-Jan-2013 00:53:34]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun falls off of the ceiling, onto Miaka's face.
[14-Jan-2013 00:53:44]  <Sumire> So do we get out here?
[14-Jan-2013 00:53:49]  <Aoi> "Ah...."
[14-Jan-2013 00:53:56]  * Miaka_Watanabe yelps slightly, pulls the supernatural animal off and holds it at arm's length.
[14-Jan-2013 00:54:15]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "Dammit, Pyunpyun! What's going on?"
[14-Jan-2013 00:54:22]  * Miaka_Watanabe says, turning Pyunpyun to face her.
[14-Jan-2013 00:54:33]  <IllFlower> the same loud "blong" echoes as the door opens. floor 38 is... dark. the windows are nearly pitch black, even though it's the middle of the afternoon.
[14-Jan-2013 00:54:53]  * Miaka_Watanabe looks past pyun into the room.
[14-Jan-2013 00:55:05]  <IllFlower> the only light comes from faint emergency strips along the sides of the hallway, on the floow.
[14-Jan-2013 00:55:08]  <IllFlower> floor.
[14-Jan-2013 00:55:30]  <Aoi> "So much for the math."
[14-Jan-2013 00:55:35]  <IllFlower> the emergency lighting casts everything in an eerie green tone.
[14-Jan-2013 00:56:05]  * Miaka_Watanabe lowers Pyun to the floor. "I...guess it really is a witch," she says, seeming to increase in confidence.
[14-Jan-2013 00:56:08]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun looks around, then jumps out of Miaka's arms and walks towards a stairwell door.
[14-Jan-2013 00:56:14]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((or that.))
[14-Jan-2013 00:56:44]  <IllFlower> "come on, this way. I know young people love to do things with each other in the dark, but try to hold yourselves back."
[14-Jan-2013 00:57:06]  <Sumire> ...Ew.  Pyunpyun, why are you talking about that!
[14-Jan-2013 00:57:11]  * Sumire walks up the stairs
[14-Jan-2013 00:57:21]  * Aoi smirks and follows
[14-Jan-2013 00:57:33]  * Miaka_Watanabe leaves the elevator and follows along, scowling.
[14-Jan-2013 00:57:36]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun leaps onto the crash bar, causing the door to yawn open.

[14-Jan-2013 00:58:49]  * Miaka_Watanabe steps ahead, puts a hand on the door to keep it from closing. "I guess we're headed to the roof..."
[14-Jan-2013 00:58:50]  <IllFlower> however, it looks like the way up is blocked by a strange swirling vortex of blue and yellow.

[14-Jan-2013 00:59:04]  <Sumire> So I guess this is how all those businessmen killed themselves?

[14-Jan-2013 00:59:42]  <IllFlower> "nobody's actually died. yet."
[14-Jan-2013 01:00:02]  * Miaka_Watanabe looks up. "They're...still alive? But you just said they killed themselves..."
[14-Jan-2013 01:00:09]  <Miaka_Watanabe> looks at Pyunpyun*
[14-Jan-2013 01:00:13]  <Aoi> "Um, he said they tried.  Right?"
[14-Jan-2013 01:00:14]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun jumps off the crash bar, letting the door close behind him and the other initiates.
[14-Jan-2013 01:00:26]  <Aoi> "How did they fai-"
[14-Jan-2013 01:00:32]  * Aoi jumps a bit at the darkness
[14-Jan-2013 01:01:30]  <IllFlower> "exactly right, Aoi. fortunately, someone's managed to intervene in all of the cases so far. your job is to make sure there aren't any more cases.
[14-Jan-2013 01:01:53]  <IllFlower> "well, that's all from me. I can't do anything else from here, and I think all of you know how to handle yourselves. see you!"
[14-Jan-2013 01:02:03]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "Wait, so we - what, jump in?"
[14-Jan-2013 01:02:04]  <Sumire> ...and there he goes.
[14-Jan-2013 01:02:14]  <Aoi> "I hope we get paid a lot, Sumire."
[14-Jan-2013 01:02:18]  <Sumire> And yeah, I think we have to jump in.  At least, that's how it was last time.
[14-Jan-2013 01:02:21]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun jumps onto the railing and leaps down the gap in the center of the stairwell, vanishing into the darkness.

[14-Jan-2013 01:02:43]  * Miaka_Watanabe looks at the swirl, a smile spreading on her face. "Alright, well, let's go, then!" She braces, and then runs in.
[14-Jan-2013 01:02:45]  * Sumire also walks into the portal
[14-Jan-2013 01:03:02]  <Sumire> There's one last thing we should do though.
[14-Jan-2013 01:03:08]  <Sumire> This is the fun part.  TRANSFORM!

[14-Jan-2013 01:04:19]  <Sumire> Once again, a pink flash of light emerges from Sumire, and she re-emerges in her shimmering dress

[14-Jan-2013 01:05:23]  <Sumire> ...hahaha oh my goodness Aoi, that is pretty amazing.
[14-Jan-2013 01:05:45]  <Sumire> If it wouldn't probably incriminate us all or something I'd be snapping so many photos right now
[14-Jan-2013 01:05:47]  * Aoi growls.  "Listen you peons- I mean- gggggh, can't we focus on the bad guys?"
[14-Jan-2013 01:06:05]  * Miaka_Watanabe switches back to a determined look. "Right, right. Sorry, I'll bug you for this later. Where's this monster?"
[14-Jan-2013 01:06:18]  <IllFlower> the portal isn't getting any more patient!
[14-Jan-2013 01:06:28]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((we already entered it dinnwe))

[14-Jan-2013 01:06:49]  <IllFlower> the three initiates head into the portal, emerging... underwater. hm.
[14-Jan-2013 01:06:56]  <Aoi> !!

[14-Jan-2013 01:07:03]  * Miaka_Watanabe panics, looking around
[14-Jan-2013 01:07:10]  <IllFlower> underfoot is a large coral reef, with the usual array of anemones and sponges attached to it.
[14-Jan-2013 01:07:34]  <IllFlower> a few fish in too-bright colors also swoop around in the light blue water.
[14-Jan-2013 01:07:54]  <IllFlower> Sumire: I don't know. maybe someone should try breathing?
[14-Jan-2013 01:07:55]  * Miaka_Watanabe continues to hold her breath, and attempts to start swimming to the surface.
[14-Jan-2013 01:08:30]  <IllFlower> Miaka gets about two meters up before she realizes that the surface isn't getting any closer.
[14-Jan-2013 01:08:50]  * Miaka_Watanabe starts looking distressed. ((this revelation is going to have to come from someone else))
[14-Jan-2013 01:08:52]  * Aoi was already low on breath before walking into the portal, so he soon gives up on holding is breath
[14-Jan-2013 01:09:31]  <IllFlower> to his surprise, Aoi finds that his lungs aren't immediately inundated by water.
[14-Jan-2013 01:09:53]  * Aoi splutters regardless
[14-Jan-2013 01:09:59]  <Aoi> "ah..."
[14-Jan-2013 01:10:14]  * Miaka_Watanabe looks, confused (and sinking back to the coral).

[14-Jan-2013 01:10:53]  <Sumire> So...I guess we can breathe in this water?  That's nice, at least we won't die from that.  I'm not looking forward to how pruned my fingers are going to get, though.
[14-Jan-2013 01:11:35]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "What is with this place..." Miaka says. She spots the squid, but takes no heed.
[14-Jan-2013 01:11:53]  <IllFlower> there don't appear to be any immediate threats, not even the giant squid. whatever it is, it isn't coming out on its own.

[14-Jan-2013 01:46:37]  <IllFlower> Sumire's back up to 15 Resolve.
[14-Jan-2013 01:46:44]  <Sumire> 14I think so
[14-Jan-2013 01:47:25]  <IllFlower> that's Aoi's turn, then. round's over. anyone want to swap attribute assignments for attack/defense/support?
[14-Jan-2013 01:47:38]  <Sumire> 14I'm good
[14-Jan-2013 01:47:43]  * Aoi swims over to Sumire, and a small current can be felt moving to Aoi's hands.  Witchblood and normal water alike glows as it goes through his hands and over Sumire's wounds, healing them.
[14-Jan-2013 01:47:47]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((Think I'm good, because I don't know how to support))
[14-Jan-2013 01:47:48]  <Aoi> 14I'm good.
[14-Jan-2013 01:48:00]  <Aoi> 14I don't know what support does anyway.  Healing seems supporty.
[14-Jan-2013 01:48:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((why od I keep thinking I'm sumire >_>))
[14-Jan-2013 01:48:14]  <IllFlower> you use it to cover or revive.
[14-Jan-2013 01:48:30]  <Fiora> ((it also applies to that ability that lets you analyze a witch's weaknesses))
[14-Jan-2013 01:48:31]  <Sumire> 14also reading a magical foe
[14-Jan-2013 01:48:36]  <IllFlower> you can also use it to read an enemy or perform sorcery (p. 15).
[14-Jan-2013 01:48:52]  <Aoi> Ah, sorry Miaka, I can only do much at once.  I'm sure I can give you the liquid treatment too, eheh...?
[14-Jan-2013 01:49:02]  <IllFlower> or to help/disrupt (p. 14).
[14-Jan-2013 01:49:30]  <IllFlower> (the polyp reaches out with a tentacle holding a paper fan, and slaps Aoi.)
[14-Jan-2013 01:49:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe> Miaka nods. "It's okay, I'll be fine. Let's just beat this thing."
[14-Jan-2013 01:49:38]  * Sumire hugs Aoi.  "Thanks.  And don't worry, Miaka, I can protect you too."
[14-Jan-2013 01:49:44]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((,says, completely oblivious to Cock Joke))
[14-Jan-2013 01:49:44]  <Sumire> 14does magical shield take up a turn?
[14-Jan-2013 01:49:46]  <IllFlower> awwwwwwwwww
[14-Jan-2013 01:50:23]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((uh. any chance I can switch characteristics around or?))
[14-Jan-2013 01:50:25]  <Aoi> 14not actually sure what "the liquid treatment" would be a euphemism for,but luckily all the characters are teenagers!
[14-Jan-2013 01:50:54]  <IllFlower> Sumire: I'm going to say yes.
[14-Jan-2013 01:51:04]  <IllFlower> for consistency's sake, since the manual's not clear.
[14-Jan-2013 01:51:29]  <IllFlower> in any case, I totally forgot that Sumire had Swift Action, but since it makes zero difference to initiative calculations, `_`
[14-Jan-2013 01:51:43]  <IllFlower> the witch attempts to attack Aoi this time.
[14-Jan-2013 01:51:54]  <IllFlower> +roll 2m6+5
[14-Jan-2013 01:51:55]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (2+5)+5=12
[14-Jan-2013 01:52:00]  <Aoi> 142d6+6?
[14-Jan-2013 01:52:11]  <IllFlower> whatever your defense attribute is, yes.
[14-Jan-2013 01:52:17]  <Aoi> +roll 2d6+6
[14-Jan-2013 01:52:17]  <rollermine> Aoi: (3+1)+6=10
[14-Jan-2013 01:52:25]  <Aoi> 14aw shit son
[14-Jan-2013 01:52:41]  <Sumire> 14do you want me to put the shield up?
[14-Jan-2013 01:52:58]  <Fiora> (you could use overcharge; also what happens on an attack/defense tie?)
[14-Jan-2013 01:53:05]  <Aoi> 14eh i can deal i think
[14-Jan-2013 01:53:10]  <Sumire> 14it will add three points and thus push you above the 12
[14-Jan-2013 01:53:11]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((aoi doesn't have any damange ,at any rate.
[14-Jan-2013 01:53:12]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ))
[14-Jan-2013 01:53:19]  <Miaka_Watanabe> (((yet)))
[14-Jan-2013 01:53:28]  <Sumire> 14eh, if that were to happen it'd be better for me to, since I have yet to overcharge
[14-Jan-2013 01:53:39]  <IllFlower> it's also only d6+2, and the witch is likely to be dead by the end of this round.
[14-Jan-2013 01:54:01]  <Aoi> 14thpoilerth
[14-Jan-2013 01:54:19]  <Aoi> 14but yeah no.  hit me mother fucker
[14-Jan-2013 01:54:24]  <IllFlower> +roll d6+2
[14-Jan-2013 01:54:24]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 5+2=7
[14-Jan-2013 01:54:40]  <IllFlower> Aoi takes 7 damage.
[14-Jan-2013 01:54:50]  <IllFlower> meanwhile, somewhere in there Miaka restores 1 Resolve, putting her at 10.
[14-Jan-2013 01:55:13]  <IllFlower> (it's at the beginning of every one of Barcode's turns.)
[14-Jan-2013 01:55:17]  <Aoi> 14hey hey hey, where's the attack description!
[14-Jan-2013 01:55:23]  <IllFlower> getting there.
[14-Jan-2013 01:55:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((oh yeah, I forgot about my regen. :D))
[14-Jan-2013 01:55:50]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((being meguka is periods of suffering wherein you desuffer one point per turn))
[14-Jan-2013 01:55:52]  <BGTB2005> 14seems useful, that
[14-Jan-2013 01:56:11]  <IllFlower> the witch reaches out with a tentacle, striking out at the cave roof above Aoi's head. Aoi is struck by falling coral, as well as the tentacle as it retreats.
[14-Jan-2013 01:56:59]  * Aoi clutches his head.  "Guess I'll be giving myself the liquid treatment too..."
[14-Jan-2013 01:57:05]  <IllFlower> lol.
[14-Jan-2013 01:57:09]  <IllFlower> Sumire's next.
[14-Jan-2013 01:57:18]  <Sumire> 14attack

[14-Jan-2013 01:58:16]  <IllFlower> 6 damage.
[14-Jan-2013 01:59:22]  <Sumire> Sumire uses her portals to move herself into the witch's escape route.  The witch, startled, is unable to respond as Sumire brandishes her wand and, with a kiai, blasts a flash of light into the witch.
[14-Jan-2013 01:59:36]  <IllFlower> good, good. Miaka_Watanabe?
[14-Jan-2013 02:00:09]  <Miaka_Watanabe>  /me glances at Aoi worriedly while sprinting into a new position, circling the monster, but sees him rising from the rubble reasonably intact. She readies the Kruger again. "Smile, you son of a..."
[14-Jan-2013 02:00:13]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((great. space.))
[14-Jan-2013 02:00:19]  <IllFlower> you're at 11 resolve now.
[14-Jan-2013 02:00:24]  <IllFlower> by the way.
[14-Jan-2013 02:00:35]  <IllFlower> I take it that means you're attacking?
[14-Jan-2013 02:00:42]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((I can't really change that, so I guess I'm gonna attack.))
[14-Jan-2013 02:00:49]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((Other option is to defend, right?))
[14-Jan-2013 02:00:55]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((or support, I guess. anyway yeah attacking))
[14-Jan-2013 02:00:57]  <Miaka_Watanabe> +roll 2d6+8
[14-Jan-2013 02:00:58]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe: (4+4)+8=16

[14-Jan-2013 02:01:17]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((m?))
[14-Jan-2013 02:01:39]  <Sumire> 14it automatically does the overcharge-die-on-6 thing
[14-Jan-2013 02:01:40]  <IllFlower> it does automatic extra dice on 6s.
[14-Jan-2013 02:01:46]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((aaah.))
[14-Jan-2013 02:01:51]  <BGTB2005> 14seems useful, that
[14-Jan-2013 02:01:53]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((sweet. will keep in mind))
[14-Jan-2013 02:02:02]  <Aoi> 14neat trick, sumire
[14-Jan-2013 02:02:06]  <Miaka_Watanabe> +2m6+4

[14-Jan-2013 02:02:26]  <IllFlower> in any case, I think I'm going to take an extra die on this challenge...
[14-Jan-2013 02:02:30]  <IllFlower> +roll m6
[14-Jan-2013 02:02:31]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 1=1

[14-Jan-2013 02:02:39]  <IllFlower> fat lot of good that did, ha.
[14-Jan-2013 02:02:48]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((jaws reference prevails!))
[14-Jan-2013 02:02:57]  <IllFlower> okay, that's all from me. Miaka_Watanabe, roll for damage.
[14-Jan-2013 02:03:15]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((oh, shit. already did that before your roll, forgot about challenges. guess I reroll?))
[14-Jan-2013 02:03:26]  <Sumire> 14nah, just roll for damage
[14-Jan-2013 02:03:29]  <IllFlower> that's d6+4 anyway
[14-Jan-2013 02:03:32]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ah.
[14-Jan-2013 02:03:36]  <IllFlower> no "m"
[14-Jan-2013 02:03:39]  <Miaka_Watanabe> +roll d6+4
[14-Jan-2013 02:03:39]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe: 4+4=8
[14-Jan-2013 02:03:51]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((acceptable!(?)))
[14-Jan-2013 02:04:03]  <IllFlower> 8 damage. go ahead and describe the attack.
[14-Jan-2013 02:04:57]  * Miaka_Watanabe does what she did in the previous message, sliding to a stop while charging, then firing. the Kruger's azure bolt hits dead-on.
[14-Jan-2013 02:06:10]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((color pending))
[14-Jan-2013 02:06:27]  <BGTB2005> 14blue is a pretty colour
[14-Jan-2013 02:06:31]  <IllFlower> the polyp seizes up, then explodes into white chunks, a yellow spray hitting the ceiling of the cave.
[14-Jan-2013 02:06:46]  <Aoi> 14azure (color subject to change) bolt
[14-Jan-2013 02:06:49]  <IllFlower> almost immediately, the coral around the cave starts to fall away into the sand.
[14-Jan-2013 02:07:03]  * Miaka_Watanabe grins wildly for a moment, then pulls an "oh crap" face as the cave collapses.
[14-Jan-2013 02:07:10]  <Sumire> We gotta get out of here.
[14-Jan-2013 02:07:12]  <Aoi> "Ah, that wasn't so bad... we'd better get going though!"
[14-Jan-2013 02:07:15]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "Yeah, but where?"
[14-Jan-2013 02:07:16]  <Sumire> I think the exit was out of the coral?
[14-Jan-2013 02:07:20]  * Sumire swims out
[14-Jan-2013 02:07:35]  <Aoi> 14maybe i could pull a sorcery to accelerate us?  I mean my element is water and all.
[14-Jan-2013 02:08:09]  <IllFlower> as the initiates swim out of the coral, they notice that everything on the sea floor is seemingly collapsing into the sand.
[14-Jan-2013 02:08:19]  <IllFlower> somehow, too, the surface seems a whole lot closer...
[14-Jan-2013 02:08:23]  <Miaka_Watanabe> (Miaka hodls her breath as she passes through the yellow crap)
[14-Jan-2013 02:08:24]  <Fiora> ((diadem?))
[14-Jan-2013 02:08:28]  <IllFlower> getting there.
[14-Jan-2013 02:09:05]  <IllFlower> the three kids flop straight out of the portal, flying sideways for a bit and landing awkwardly on the stairwell from whence they came.
[14-Jan-2013 02:09:14]  <Aoi> "Ha..."
[14-Jan-2013 02:09:29]  <Aoi> "You okay, Miaka? Sumire?"
[14-Jan-2013 02:09:34]  * Aoi detransforms as soon as possible
[14-Jan-2013 02:09:43]  <IllFlower> the portal almost immediately collapses into nothingness, and with a "plink", a small trinket pops into existence where it once stood.
[14-Jan-2013 02:09:43]  * Miaka_Watanabe rolls over, panting. "That thing was...gross."
[14-Jan-2013 02:09:47]  <Sumire> ...ouch.  I think I'm okay.  Awkward landing, though.
[14-Jan-2013 02:09:52]  <IllFlower> +roll 2d6+8
[14-Jan-2013 02:09:53]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (6+1)+8=15
[14-Jan-2013 02:10:19]  * Miaka_Watanabe gets into a crouch, is passed over by chains again, reappears as normal. The trinket catches her eye.
[14-Jan-2013 02:10:30]  <IllFlower> 15. you guys accumulated only 10 corruption, so you can wipe it all away and have someone hold on to the spare charges.
[14-Jan-2013 02:10:53]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((3, 3, and 4, hm?))
[14-Jan-2013 02:11:14]  <IllFlower> Aoi 4, Miaka 4, Sumire 2.
[14-Jan-2013 02:11:20]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((hm.))
[14-Jan-2013 02:11:21]  <Aoi> 14livin' dangerously
[14-Jan-2013 02:11:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((oh right, defending against witches, presumably))
[14-Jan-2013 02:11:43]  <IllFlower> I may have messed up some numbers in there somewhere, but it's unlikely you guys accumulated enough corruption for it to make any difference.
[14-Jan-2013 02:11:57]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "So, uh...what do you guys want to do with that thing?"
[14-Jan-2013 02:12:05]  <Sumire> I'll take it.  I think it could come in handy later.
[14-Jan-2013 02:12:23]  <Aoi> "Aw, it's pretty..."
[14-Jan-2013 02:12:24]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((can we like, feel corruption? I guess so))
[14-Jan-2013 02:12:27]  <IllFlower> witch stats are now posted.
[14-Jan-2013 02:12:58]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "Suppose we should...er, 'heal' ourselves first, or whatever, no...?"
[14-Jan-2013 02:13:00]  <ponicalica> Wasn't Gisela one of the Madoka witches as well
[14-Jan-2013 02:13:13]  <Sumire> Sorry, Aoi.  Did the witch help you with your English, by the way?
[14-Jan-2013 02:13:15]  <IllFlower> in the meantime, experience! each of you should pick a player to award your 1 gift XP to.
[14-Jan-2013 02:13:33]  <Sumire> I'll gift XP to Aoi
[14-Jan-2013 02:13:45]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((Guess I'll give mine to Sumire, then.))
[14-Jan-2013 02:13:48]  <Aoi> "Pol... po... eugh, I can't even say it."
[14-Jan-2013 02:13:56]  <Aoi> 14to miaka then.
[14-Jan-2013 02:14:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((this really is a communistdoka game))
[14-Jan-2013 02:14:13]  <IllFlower> hahahaha.
[14-Jan-2013 02:14:23]  <Aoi> 14being collectivized is suffering
[14-Jan-2013 02:14:51]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((jesus, I've even got John the Fisherman playing. everything is thematically falling into place))
[14-Jan-2013 02:15:08]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((calling john the fi sh er man))
[14-Jan-2013 02:15:28]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun appears again, climbing up the stairs.
[14-Jan-2013 02:15:47]  <IllFlower> "good job, everyone," he says. he appears to be... slightly out of breath.
[14-Jan-2013 02:15:50]  <IllFlower> **
[14-Jan-2013 02:15:51]  * Miaka_Watanabe folds her arms, smirking despite herself.
[14-Jan-2013 02:15:57]  <Aoi> "What's with you?"
[14-Jan-2013 02:16:31]  <IllFlower> Aoi: "what do you mean, what's with me?"
[14-Jan-2013 02:17:11]  <Aoi> "Did you run up the stairs to get here or something?  I didn't think geckosharktopi could get so tired from ust a few fluffyhair transforms."
[14-Jan-2013 02:17:50]  <IllFlower> "I'd like to see you after walking up forty flights of stairs," Pyunpyun says. **
[14-Jan-2013 02:18:02]  <Sumire> Couldn't you just use the elevator again?
[14-Jan-2013 02:18:27]  *** kingCrackers <~Lin_Chong@203.116.251.233> has joined #madokamadness
[14-Jan-2013 02:18:34]  <Sumire> Heck, what were you doing that was so important while we were fighting anyways?
[14-Jan-2013 02:18:46]  <IllFlower> "it's *exercise*. I'm sure I don't have to lecture you on its importance."
[14-Jan-2013 02:18:52]  <Aoi> "Well why'd you even walk off if you were just gonna come back?  Seems like a bad way to help me with my ma- oh darn, I really need to get to studying, don't I.  Uuuuuugh see you all later"
[14-Jan-2013 02:19:00]  * Aoi dashes off to the elevator
[14-Jan-2013 02:19:20]  <IllFlower> unsurprisingly, the lights are all back on up on floor 38.
[14-Jan-2013 02:19:31]  <IllFlower> the stairwell is still pretty musty, though.
[14-Jan-2013 02:19:35]  <Aoi> 14oh, thanks for adding my experience, powers that be.
[14-Jan-2013 02:19:46]  <Sumire> Time to head back down the elevator, I guess.
[14-Jan-2013 02:20:10]  <IllFlower> have fun!
[14-Jan-2013 02:20:10]  <Sumire> Will we be as invisible going down as we were going up?
[14-Jan-2013 02:20:11]  * Miaka_Watanabe looks around. "Okay, but...I just don't want to go through the offices again. You sure we can't take the stairs..."
[14-Jan-2013 02:20:43]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun accompanies the initiates down the elevator.
[14-Jan-2013 02:20:58]  * Miaka_Watanabe joins, but has returned to frowning slightly.
[14-Jan-2013 02:21:17]  <Aoi> "Ahaha, why'd I even run off if I had to wait for the elevator anyway..."
[14-Jan-2013 02:21:18]  <IllFlower> when the door opens to the lobby, the receptionist gives them a strange look. seems like they're not invisible anymore.
[14-Jan-2013 02:21:43]  * Aoi nods at 'em, smiling
[14-Jan-2013 02:21:44]  * Miaka_Watanabe seems to almost shrink.
[14-Jan-2013 02:22:04]  <Miaka_Watanabe> "let's get out of here," Miaka says, quickly exiting the elevator.
[14-Jan-2013 02:22:11]  <IllFlower> she promptly shrugs and resumes working, though. apparently, she's operating on the assumption that if they got into the building without issue, surely there's nothing wrong with them leaving.
[14-Jan-2013 02:22:41]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((sorry. forgot about the stars))
[14-Jan-2013 02:22:54]  <IllFlower> **

[14-Jan-2013 02:22:57]  <IllFlower> whatever.
[14-Jan-2013 02:23:03]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((Just don't want to inturrupt!))
[14-Jan-2013 02:23:20]  * Miaka_Watanabe hurriedly walks to the door and gets out as quickly as possible.
[14-Jan-2013 02:23:29]  <Aoi> "Ah, Pyunpyun, any chance you really can help me with all that math?"
[14-Jan-2013 02:23:47]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun is... yet again, nowhere to be found.
[14-Jan-2013 02:24:00]  * Aoi -_-
[14-Jan-2013 02:24:18]  <Sumire> I think he disappeared to creepy animal land again.  You could come over to my house and we could try to study some!
[14-Jan-2013 02:24:53]  * Miaka_Watanabe waits off to the side of the entrance, pretending to use her cellphone.
[14-Jan-2013 02:25:05]  <Aoi> "Oh, that'd be great!" Aoi says, brightening up.  "Do you have anything for headaches?  That rock stuff really hurts."
[14-Jan-2013 02:25:10]  <Miaka_Watanabe> ((on the outside, of course))
[14-Jan-2013 02:25:18]  <IllFlower> lololol.
[14-Jan-2013 02:25:41]  <IllFlower> okay, session's over, everyone. thanks for playing!
