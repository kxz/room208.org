[24-Mar-2013 19:17:42]  <IllFlower> Yui, Yuna, and Sumire have managed to track down the building in the news report from earlier this evening.

[24-Mar-2013 19:18:51]  * Makoto fidgets restlessly just offstage
[24-Mar-2013 19:19:34]  <IllFlower> The Sagami Bay waterfront is visible just beyond the next block of buildings. Waves ebb in and out on the shore.
[24-Mar-2013 19:20:03]  <Sumire> 14lol, beach episode
[24-Mar-2013 19:20:34]  <IllFlower> None of the lights in the building are on, but a faint purple glow is visible through the windows.
[24-Mar-2013 19:21:13]  <buttercupistiny> ((hey fiora your favorite color is ominous))
[24-Mar-2013 19:21:14]  <IllFlower> It looks something like someone left an inhumanly large television set on inside.
[24-Mar-2013 19:21:39]  <Yuna> :<
[24-Mar-2013 19:22:28]  <IllFlower> As the three girls approach the building, they notice a human figure standing just outside the doorway.
[24-Mar-2013 19:22:37]  <IllFlower> It looks restless... *short* and restless... **
[24-Mar-2013 19:22:50]  <IllFlower> (hint, hint, cough)
[24-Mar-2013 19:23:22]  <Makoto> (thats my cue :V)

[24-Mar-2013 19:24:34]  <Sumire> 14I think Makoto's supposed to be the shortest except things didn't end up being that way
[24-Mar-2013 19:24:38]  <IllFlower> Makoto: Sometimes impatience gets the best of people.
[24-Mar-2013 19:24:59]  <IllFlower> :p
[24-Mar-2013 19:25:16]  <Makoto> "Waiting for you!"

[24-Mar-2013 19:28:39]  <IllFlower> She's very definitely making all of this up, but there's not much time to get into arguments. /whistles

[24-Mar-2013 19:31:01]  <Makoto> (i wouldn't have to make things up. if i had anything to go on.)
[24-Mar-2013 19:31:18]  <Sumire> 14I'm kind of surprised that IllFlower didn't communicate with you beforehand
[24-Mar-2013 19:31:48]  <IllFlower> It doesn't actually matter. I'm just trying to get the setting out of the way.
[24-Mar-2013 19:31:54]  <Yui> ((just shrug and rebound the question to Sumire))
[24-Mar-2013 19:32:29]  <Makoto> (okay fine lets just pretend. that i didnt say any of that
[24-Mar-2013 19:32:39]  <Makoto> (hello friends makoto is here. next)
[24-Mar-2013 19:32:46]  <Sumire> "Maybe it's a special case, since it'll be hard to deal with things when one of the remaining initiates is weaponless."
[24-Mar-2013 19:33:39]  * IllFlower waves hands
[24-Mar-2013 19:33:56]  <Yui> ((HI NEMO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR YOUR DAD?))
[24-Mar-2013 19:34:13]  <Makoto> (s. sorry about thiiiiis X__X)
[24-Mar-2013 19:34:25]  <IllFlower> It looks like Pyunpyun isn't exactly on top of things, but that's nothing new.
[24-Mar-2013 19:34:32]  <Makoto> (*plays Autrechre loudly*)
[24-Mar-2013 19:35:51]  <IllFlower> Either way, the girls come to a general agreement that his edicts are more of... guidelines, especially when there's a witch with Yuna's flashlight *right* *there* and everything.
[24-Mar-2013 19:36:07]  <IllFlower> Let's get back to entering that building, shall we? **
[24-Mar-2013 19:36:27]  <Yui> ((no we shall hop on pogo sticks in front of the building forever))
[24-Mar-2013 19:36:44]  * Yui reaches back for Yuna's hand
[24-Mar-2013 19:36:48]  * Yuna quietly steps up behind Yui and looks around nervously, hoping nobody will pay attention to the fact that she started this mess
[24-Mar-2013 19:36:53]  * Yuna reaches out for Yui's hand
[24-Mar-2013 19:37:03]  <Yui> "you ready for this?"
[24-Mar-2013 19:37:12]  <IllFlower> Yui: In which case, the witch tops you with whipped cream and eats you. :p
[24-Mar-2013 19:37:18]  <Sumire> "Anyways, we should probably enter the building before transforming, so that if there is a stalker watching us they won't actually see the transformation"
[24-Mar-2013 19:37:33]  <Yuna> "I don't know, but I guess I have to be, right?"
[24-Mar-2013 19:37:37]  <Makoto> (oh! yes a. meessagggee i got one of those)
[24-Mar-2013 19:38:33]  <Yui> "Right, Yuna. And good idea Sumire. Off to see the wizard, then?"
[24-Mar-2013 19:38:43]  <Makoto> (okay substitute impatient shuffling for really nervous shuffling)
[24-Mar-2013 19:39:51]  <IllFlower> The initiates walk up to the front door and pull it open, entering the building.
[24-Mar-2013 19:40:05]  <IllFlower> It seems to close quite firmly behind them with a "click."
[24-Mar-2013 19:40:19]  <IllFlower> Ahead of them lies a long hallway, with only a door at the other end.
[24-Mar-2013 19:41:10]  <IllFlower> The same purple glow casts itself on the walls. It fades in and out slowly, like the breath of a sleeping child. **
[24-Mar-2013 19:43:35]  <Sumire> "The purple seems rather ominous.  I think it's dangerous.  We should TRANSFORM!"
[24-Mar-2013 19:43:51]  <Yuna> I like the color though.. it's kind of pretty
[24-Mar-2013 19:44:17]  * Sumire does standard transformation procedure, only straining a little bit to seem cheerful during the process
[24-Mar-2013 19:44:53]  * Makoto looks helplessly at Yui
[24-Mar-2013 19:45:00]  <Makoto> "Uhm...?"
[24-Mar-2013 19:45:13]  * Yui looks helplessly at Makoto
[24-Mar-2013 19:45:26]  <Yui> In theory we shouldn't.
[24-Mar-2013 19:45:57]  <IllFlower> In practice?
[24-Mar-2013 19:46:27]  * Yuna quietly does her transformation sequence near Yui, making sure to turn down the volume on the dramatic music
[24-Mar-2013 19:46:47]  * Yui turns to Yuna
[24-Mar-2013 19:47:13]  * Yuna twirls her dress happily
[24-Mar-2013 19:47:14]  <Yui> what do you think? is transforming safe?
[24-Mar-2013 19:47:26]  <Yui> for me'n makoto, I mean
[24-Mar-2013 19:48:04]  * Yuna 's face shows her nervousness.  "Um.... I... I don't know... I don't know how much to trust the fuzzball..."
[24-Mar-2013 19:48:15]  <Yuna> "But... I don't think fighting untransformed is a good idea..."
[24-Mar-2013 19:48:57]  <Makoto> "aw don't ask /her/ that Yui, she's 'fraid of /everything!/ " *transformatory explosion. albeit a muffled one*
[24-Mar-2013 19:49:23]  <Makoto> "Nobody can see us in here."
[24-Mar-2013 19:49:36]  <Yui> Same conflicts here, Yuna, but I couldn't forgive myself if something happened to you and I couldn't stop it *poof(
[24-Mar-2013 19:50:03]  <IllFlower> (Abruptly, the back door opens to reveal... "Smile! You're on Candid Camera!")
[24-Mar-2013 19:50:24]  <Makoto> (noooooooooo)
[24-Mar-2013 19:50:49]  <Yui> (gloom, despair, and agony on me)
[24-Mar-2013 19:51:04]  <IllFlower> The hallway seems utterly indifferent to the four girls' transformations. **
[24-Mar-2013 19:52:19]  <Sumire> "Do you think we should head for the light now?"
[24-Mar-2013 19:52:24]  <Makoto> "Heh. Heh heh. See?" *more nervous fidgeting*
[24-Mar-2013 19:52:49]  <Yui> Yui reaches out for Makoto's hand as well. Sumire
[24-Mar-2013 19:53:01]  <Yui> 's right, towards the light but not alone
[24-Mar-2013 19:53:06]  * Makoto takes the offered hand unconsciously
[24-Mar-2013 19:54:32]  <IllFlower> The girls tentatively advance on the door at the other end of the hallway.
[24-Mar-2013 19:55:01]  <IllFlower> Sumire pulls it open to reveal a stairwell leading upwards.
[24-Mar-2013 19:55:05]  * Makoto stage whisper "let's just hurry up and kill this dumb thing, 'mkay?"
[24-Mar-2013 19:55:32]  <IllFlower> The purple glow that was present in the hall mixes with the green of lit emergency exit signs.
[24-Mar-2013 19:55:52]  <IllFlower> The stairs go up for about four floors before ending, it looks like.
[24-Mar-2013 19:55:53]  <Makoto> (EVA 01 COLORS)
[24-Mar-2013 19:56:02]  <IllFlower> **
[24-Mar-2013 19:56:21]  <IllFlower> Oh, oh. There's a door on each floor, of course. **
[24-Mar-2013 19:56:35]  * Makoto wordlessly starts climbing the stairs
[24-Mar-2013 19:57:23]  * Yuna follows behind
[24-Mar-2013 19:57:24]  * Sumire also starts climbing the stairs
[24-Mar-2013 19:57:54]  * Yui follows suit
[24-Mar-2013 19:58:15]  <IllFlower> The girls try the door on the second floor, but it seems to be quite firmly locked.
[24-Mar-2013 19:58:40]  <IllFlower> Nobody seems to have a dungeon key or anything like that, so they move on to the third floor. No such luck there, either.
[24-Mar-2013 19:58:45]  * Yuna talks, in a bit of a whisper: "I wonder what'll happen when I try to fight but don't have the flashlight..."
[24-Mar-2013 19:59:03]  <IllFlower> Upon reaching the fourth and uppermost floor, they find... two doors.
[24-Mar-2013 19:59:12]  <IllFlower> One of them is the usual door leading back into the building.
[24-Mar-2013 19:59:19]  <Makoto> "Uhm. Can't ya just make it... like, poof?"
[24-Mar-2013 19:59:47]  <IllFlower> The second, though, is on a different wall, and appears to lead straight out of what the girls remember being the side of the building. Hm. **
[24-Mar-2013 19:59:50]  <Yuna> poof....?
[24-Mar-2013 20:00:05]  * Makoto materializes her cannon out of thin air
[24-Mar-2013 20:00:10]  <Makoto> "Like that. Poof!"
[24-Mar-2013 20:00:19]  <Yuna> U-um... I've never tried that...  let me see!
[24-Mar-2013 20:00:33]  * Yuna tries her best to imagine materializing her flashlight, Illflower decides what happens
[24-Mar-2013 20:00:47]  <Makoto> (That would be very convenient >_>)
[24-Mar-2013 20:00:53]  <Makoto> (Perhaps TOO convenient.)
[24-Mar-2013 20:00:56]  <Makoto> (<_<)
[24-Mar-2013 20:01:12]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that's not happening. :p
[24-Mar-2013 20:01:21]  * Yuna fizzle 
[24-Mar-2013 20:01:46]  <IllFlower> I mean, she did consciously abandon it. That's gotta be weighing on her mind.
[24-Mar-2013 20:01:56]  <Aoi> 14Aoi appears, drenched in sewage
[24-Mar-2013 20:02:04]  <Makoto> "...aw. Guess that would have been to easy, huh."
[24-Mar-2013 20:02:07]  <Yuna> M-makoto... it... I really don't think that'll work...
[24-Mar-2013 20:02:10]  * Makoto unpoofs the cannon
[24-Mar-2013 20:02:16]  <Makoto> *too
[24-Mar-2013 20:02:38]  <IllFlower> Aoi comes running up the stairs just as the girls are thinking about what to do on the fourth floor...
[24-Mar-2013 20:03:00]  <Makoto> "Y-yaaahhh! It's th-the stalke-! Oh it's Aoi. Hi!"
[24-Mar-2013 20:03:04]  <Yuna> ("Hi, laaadies", he says, unbuttoning his shirt)
[24-Mar-2013 20:03:10]  <Makoto> (pfff)
[24-Mar-2013 20:03:24]  <Makoto> (brb)
[24-Mar-2013 20:03:31]  <IllFlower> ("yaranaika?")
[24-Mar-2013 20:03:39]  <Sumire> 14brb as well
[24-Mar-2013 20:03:51]  <Aoi> "Hi, sorry I'm-" *huff* "-late, the address I heard from Sumire turned out to be a land... a landfill" *huff*
[24-Mar-2013 20:04:26]  <Makoto> (back)
[24-Mar-2013 20:05:01]  <IllFlower> Someone should pick a door, eh?
[24-Mar-2013 20:05:08]  <Yui> (he went upstairs so I don't even know what he's up to.... wait yes I do))
[24-Mar-2013 20:05:20]  <IllFlower> Maybe there's a secret weapons cache if you try the normal door. You never know!
[24-Mar-2013 20:05:39]  <IllFlower> Or maybe just a goat...
[24-Mar-2013 20:05:59]  <Makoto> (it is a room with a moose)
[24-Mar-2013 20:06:01]  <Yui> ((a goat is totally a legit secret weapon))
[24-Mar-2013 20:06:09]  <BGTB2005> 14or a bust of some long dead philosopher?
[24-Mar-2013 20:06:22]  <Makoto> +roll d2
[24-Mar-2013 20:06:22]  <rollermine> Makoto: 1=1
[24-Mar-2013 20:06:29]  * Makoto tries opening the left door
[24-Mar-2013 20:07:01]  <Sumire> 14back
[24-Mar-2013 20:07:04]  <Makoto> (patented Makoto Decision Making Process)
[24-Mar-2013 20:08:29]  <IllFlower> The left door happens to be the normal door, so let's see...
[24-Mar-2013 20:08:46]  <IllFlower> Makoto opens the door to reveal a large darkened room that seems to cover the entire floor.
[24-Mar-2013 20:09:04]  <IllFlower> One might wager that the place used to house desks and benches for some company, but no longer.
[24-Mar-2013 20:09:16]  <Makoto> (do i see anything spooky)
[24-Mar-2013 20:09:29]  <Makoto> (i mean, spookier than usual for an abandoned office building >_>)
[24-Mar-2013 20:09:42]  <IllFlower> All that's visible, aside from some shuttered windows, are a tipped-over office chair and, on the wall next to it, a message written in what appears to be relfective paint...
[24-Mar-2013 20:09:54]  <IllFlower> "BELLUM OMNIA CONTRA OMNES"
[24-Mar-2013 20:10:03]  <IllFlower> * OMNIUM
[24-Mar-2013 20:10:32]  <IllFlower> We have a player here who knows Latin. Gotta get that declension right.
[24-Mar-2013 20:10:34]  <IllFlower> **
[24-Mar-2013 20:10:49]  <Sumire> 14hahaha, yeah.
[24-Mar-2013 20:10:57]  <Makoto> (well even if I know what that says, Makoto certainly doesn't)
[24-Mar-2013 20:11:19]  <Makoto> "Uh. I don't suppose any of you speak English...?"

[24-Mar-2013 20:12:55]  <Yuna> :<
[24-Mar-2013 20:14:02]  * Makoto shrugs, tries other door
[24-Mar-2013 20:14:35]  <IllFlower> A peal of laughter echoes through the stairwell as Makoto places her hand on the doorknob.
[24-Mar-2013 20:14:50]  <Makoto> (I LET THE SPOOKY THINGS OUT)
[24-Mar-2013 20:15:21]  <IllFlower> There's the sound, too, of... violins? **
[24-Mar-2013 20:15:33]  <Yuna> (it's sayaka)

[24-Mar-2013 20:16:58]  <Yui> "Ya think?"
[24-Mar-2013 20:17:15]  <BGTB2005> 14it would be a bit surprising if it weren't
[24-Mar-2013 20:17:27]  <Makoto> (just a bit)
[24-Mar-2013 20:17:29]  <Sumire> "I think so.  Let's go in and fight, I guess."
[24-Mar-2013 20:17:48]  * Makoto turns the knob and opens the door
[24-Mar-2013 20:18:05]  <IllFlower> Huh.
[24-Mar-2013 20:18:08]  <IllFlower> Well... huh.
[24-Mar-2013 20:18:15]  <Aoi> "Huh?"
[24-Mar-2013 20:18:53]  <IllFlower> A horn fanfare erupts from beyond the door, which has opened onto confetti falling down...
[24-Mar-2013 20:19:14]  <IllFlower> On the beach a good two hundred meters away.
[24-Mar-2013 20:19:26]  <Aoi> "Oh."
[24-Mar-2013 20:19:42]  <Aoi> "Huh?"
[24-Mar-2013 20:19:45]  <IllFlower> Kind of. The water appears to be the color of puddled oil, purple and green and gold, and it's hard to miss...
[24-Mar-2013 20:20:21]  <Yuna> "we're going to be... fighting... in the ocean...?"
[24-Mar-2013 20:20:25]  <Yuna> "I don't think I'm dressed for this..."
[24-Mar-2013 20:20:42]  <Aoi> "Well that's hardly new, eh?"
[24-Mar-2013 20:20:59]  <IllFlower> There's a large faceless figure resembling a queen from a deck of playing cards, sitting in a throne that hovers over the oil-water.
[24-Mar-2013 20:21:07]  <Makoto> "These places are always so weird..." Makoto strolls forward casually into the barrier.

[24-Mar-2013 20:21:42]  * Sumire walks into the barrier
[24-Mar-2013 20:21:55]  <IllFlower> Various trappings of royalty float alongside her. An intricate flagon, a staff, a... lot of other things... **
[24-Mar-2013 20:22:26]  <Makoto> (i don't suppose the flashlight is one of them?)
[24-Mar-2013 20:22:30]  <Yuna> "Oh... I guess I didn't fight that one."
[24-Mar-2013 20:22:47]  * Makoto repoofs the cannon
[24-Mar-2013 20:22:57]  <Aoi> "I'm actually pretty good at Pinochle."
[24-Mar-2013 20:22:59]  * Aoi walks in
[24-Mar-2013 20:23:01]  <Yui> "Well get through this, we always do."
[24-Mar-2013 20:23:04]  * Sumire readies wand
[24-Mar-2013 20:23:17]  <IllFlower> As the initiates step out onto the beach in front of the queen, the water behind her rises into a wall, blocking out the night sky.
[24-Mar-2013 20:23:39]  <IllFlower> In the midst of this inverted waterfall floats Yuna's flashlight. **
[24-Mar-2013 20:23:57]  <Yuna> t-there... there it is... it's... it's behind it...
[24-Mar-2013 20:24:02]  <Aoi> "Ah, you were looking for that, right?"
[24-Mar-2013 20:24:19]  * Yuna gestures, reaches out feebly for it
[24-Mar-2013 20:24:25]  <Aoi> "Uh, sorry for that time, by the way."
[24-Mar-2013 20:24:47]  <Aoi> "Didn't have my head on straight, not that that's an excuse..."
[24-Mar-2013 20:24:48]  <Yuna> That time...?

[24-Mar-2013 20:25:17]  <Yuna> ((but I thought that was sumire))
[24-Mar-2013 20:25:26]  <Makoto> "Don't worry, Yuna. We'll get your thingamabob back."
[24-Mar-2013 20:25:26]  <Aoi> "With the uh, when you dropped it? I guess? Sorry, I'm kind of behind on things here."
[24-Mar-2013 20:25:32]  <IllFlower> Pick your attributes whenever you're ready. We're starting battle.

[24-Mar-2013 20:27:40]  <IllFlower> -3 penalty to magical challenges. Doesn't affect initiative or damage counts.
[24-Mar-2013 20:30:23]  <IllFlower> Okay, we're all in order. The witch attacks first.

[24-Mar-2013 20:33:31]  <IllFlower> The witch performs a Burst Attack against the first three people it sees, which happen to be Makoto, Sumire, and Aoi.

[24-Mar-2013 20:35:33]  <IllFlower> Aoi successfully defends; the rest fail unless you want to use Overcharge.
[24-Mar-2013 20:35:53]  <Makoto> hm, 1 point of OC for another d6, correct?
[24-Mar-2013 20:36:00]  <IllFlower> Yes.

[24-Mar-2013 20:36:10]  <IllFlower> That's on your Df attribute.

[24-Mar-2013 20:36:23]  <IllFlower> You can compute that. d6+floor(13/2).

[24-Mar-2013 20:37:24]  <Sumire> 14I forget , doesn't it go down by two each burst?
[24-Mar-2013 20:37:34]  <IllFlower> No, I'm using the ability on p. 36.
[24-Mar-2013 20:37:41]  <Sumire> 14fuck
[24-Mar-2013 20:37:49]  <Sumire> 14hmm, should I do another overcharge, or am I even allowed

[24-Mar-2013 20:39:41]  <rollermine> Sumire: (6)+4+6=16
[24-Mar-2013 20:39:57]  <IllFlower> The witch removes its crown, leaving its faceless head bare. The crown splits into three pieces, which in turn shatter into sharp fragments that fly at the initiates.
[24-Mar-2013 20:40:15]  <IllFlower> Aoi and Makoto manage to dodge. Sumire... well.
[24-Mar-2013 20:40:22]  * Aoi gracefully sidesteps
[24-Mar-2013 20:40:27]  <IllFlower> ponicalica can tell us.
[24-Mar-2013 20:40:45]  * Makoto blasts the airborne shards right out of the sky
[24-Mar-2013 20:41:17]  <Makoto> (flak cannon mode B-)
[24-Mar-2013 20:41:36]  <IllFlower> 16 damage, in the meanwhile.
[24-Mar-2013 20:42:43]  <IllFlower> Sumire would ordinarily get her turn here, but she's used it up already, so it's Yuna's turn next.
[24-Mar-2013 20:43:04]  <Sumire> The fragment launches at Sumire too fast for her to dodge; she catches it with her hand.  She pulls it out, then launches it back at the witch as one in a flurry of what looks like a broken window. The witch is helpless to dodge.
[24-Mar-2013 20:43:06]  <Makoto> (hm and i take, two oc on that defense, myes?)
[24-Mar-2013 20:43:26]  <IllFlower> Makoto: Yes.

[24-Mar-2013 20:47:27]  <Yuna> ((Oh, sorry!))
[24-Mar-2013 20:47:37]  <Yuna> ((wait, how do I tell @_@))
[24-Mar-2013 20:47:50]  <Yuna> ((nobody told me...))
[24-Mar-2013 20:47:55]  <Sumire> 14IllFlower told you
[24-Mar-2013 20:48:05]  <Sumire> 13:42:43 <@IllFlower> Sumire would ordinarily get her turn here, but she's used it up already, so 
[24-Mar-2013 20:48:08]  <Sumire>                       it's Yuna's turn next.
[24-Mar-2013 20:48:13]  <Yuna> ((oh >_<))
[24-Mar-2013 20:48:16]  <Yuna> ((sorry...))
[24-Mar-2013 20:48:40]  <Yuna> "Yui... I don't know if I can do much without my flashlight... do you want to attack together?  It might be easier that way..."
[24-Mar-2013 20:49:04]  <Yui> that sounds like a good plan.
[24-Mar-2013 20:49:27]  <IllFlower> Is that a team attack, then?
[24-Mar-2013 20:49:49]  <Yui> yessir
[24-Mar-2013 20:50:10]  <IllFlower> Okay, Yuna holds for Yui's turn in that case.
[24-Mar-2013 20:50:13]  <IllFlower> Makoto, you're up.
[24-Mar-2013 20:50:30]  <Yuna> ((yup))
[24-Mar-2013 20:50:31]  <Makoto> hmmm
[24-Mar-2013 20:51:06]  <Makoto> Okay, I'm just going to make a plain ol attack

[24-Mar-2013 20:53:22]  <Aoi> Doot-doot, let's a shoot-shoot
[24-Mar-2013 20:53:35]  <IllFlower> Go ahead and roll for attack.

[24-Mar-2013 20:53:57]  * Makoto levels her cannon. A fizzing projectile erupts from the muzzle and explodes against the witch's body.
[24-Mar-2013 20:54:16]  <IllFlower> Aoi: The witch can passively defend against that.
[24-Mar-2013 20:54:27]  <IllFlower> Any changes?
[24-Mar-2013 20:54:31]  <Aoi> Nah.
[24-Mar-2013 20:54:38]  <IllFlower> Okay, attack fails.
[24-Mar-2013 20:54:40]  <Makoto> (I guess i could have used my magic strike there for a little more damage but)

[24-Mar-2013 20:55:29]  <Aoi> The arrow deflects harmlessly off the witches body. Where it strikes the ocean, a small bit of oil freezes, shining briefly before sinking.

[24-Mar-2013 21:06:21]  <Sumire> 14four strain total
[24-Mar-2013 21:06:34]  <Yuna> (ohhhhhhhhh)
[24-Mar-2013 21:06:52]  <IllFlower> Yui: The witch actually has a +2 damage bonus, which I forgot to add -- you're at 3, not 5 Rs.
[24-Mar-2013 21:07:04]  <Makoto> (ow)
[24-Mar-2013 21:07:12]  <Yui> @_@
[24-Mar-2013 21:07:13]  <Sumire> 14;_;
[24-Mar-2013 21:07:21]  * Yuna dives at the witch with Yui, taking advantage of the Witch's turn towards Yui to blast at it from behind -- it seems she can still do some light attacks, but they don't seem as effective...
[24-Mar-2013 21:07:54]  * Yuna cringes as a wave of nausea runs over her as she gets close to the witch -- this... this couldn't be the witch... could it... something's wrong with this witch.... *ow*
[24-Mar-2013 21:08:46]  <IllFlower> Yui rises and jumps at the witch, but her flight is interrupted as the witch apparates a large framed mirror in her path. She crashes through the glass and falls to the ground.
[24-Mar-2013 21:08:55]  <IllFlower> Next round. Attribute changes?
[24-Mar-2013 21:08:59]  <Makoto> none
[24-Mar-2013 21:09:03]  <Sumire> 14hmmmm
[24-Mar-2013 21:09:08]  <Sumire> 14have to think about it
[24-Mar-2013 21:09:41]  <Yui> ((none here))
[24-Mar-2013 21:09:42]  * Makoto looks on in distress. "Yui! Yuna! ...damn...!"
[24-Mar-2013 21:09:45]  <Sumire> 14yeah, I'll keep things the same
[24-Mar-2013 21:10:27]  <IllFlower> Yuna: We don't have to put Strain down on individual relationships, actually; we can just decrease your capacity stat by 4.
[24-Mar-2013 21:10:47]  <Yuna> ((capacity?))
[24-Mar-2013 21:10:58]  <Makoto> ((max strain))
[24-Mar-2013 21:11:14]  <Yuna> ((I have no idea what that means))
[24-Mar-2013 21:11:19]  <Aoi> 14I apologize. It seems it is vitally important that I change a car's tires right now. Let me see what I can do with a phone.
[24-Mar-2013 21:11:20]  <Yuna> ((I thought you can have 3 strain on each relationship))
[24-Mar-2013 21:11:28]  <Yuna> ((decreasing that by 4 would be -1)
[24-Mar-2013 21:11:48]  <IllFlower> Yuna: You can, but there's also an overall total amount of Strain you can have for all relationships.

[24-Mar-2013 21:17:11]  <IllFlower> The witch rises from its throne, stepping down onto the surface of the water.

[24-Mar-2013 21:22:13]  <Yuna> can I swap my attributes?
[24-Mar-2013 21:22:26]  <Sumire> Sumire, aggrieved by the burning sensation, lets out a distressingly loud kiai, as a shower of beams locks onto the witch.  The attack is underwhelming though.
[24-Mar-2013 21:22:33]  <IllFlower> Yuna: Go ahead.
[24-Mar-2013 21:22:41]  <IllFlower> Might affect your turn order, though.
[24-Mar-2013 21:24:42]  <Yuna> "I-I... I...  I don't know if I should attack alone here..."
[24-Mar-2013 21:24:52]  <Yuna> "Yui... do you want to try again or... that looks like that hurt a lot..."
[24-Mar-2013 21:24:56]  <IllFlower> Okay, it's Makoto's turn now, then.
[24-Mar-2013 21:25:20]  <Makoto> Okay. I'm going to take two points of Mg overcharge to act twice this turn.

[24-Mar-2013 21:25:56]  <IllFlower> Makoto: Gotcha. First action?
[24-Mar-2013 21:26:02]  <Makoto> I'm going to attack the witch, of course!

[24-Mar-2013 21:26:23]  <Makoto> well that was underwhelming
[24-Mar-2013 21:26:30]  <IllFlower> Makoto: Witch can passively defend against that.
[24-Mar-2013 21:27:10]  <Makoto> I'd probably need a ton of overcharge to beat it now...
[24-Mar-2013 21:27:12]  <Makoto> I'm not going to take any overcharge, I will simply take my second attack.
[24-Mar-2013 21:27:32]  <Makoto> Hmm.
[24-Mar-2013 21:27:38]  <IllFlower> Okay. First attack fails. Go ahead with the second.
[24-Mar-2013 21:28:25]  <Makoto> I'm going to take a point of fury overcharge to use my finishing attack.

[24-Mar-2013 21:31:13]  <Makoto> And taking a point of strain just adds 1 to the roll?
[24-Mar-2013 21:31:33]  <Makoto> Er wait no, it was Miaka I successfully Bonded with
[24-Mar-2013 21:31:41]  <IllFlower> You have an implied positive relationship with every character; you don't have to specify one in particular (yet).
[24-Mar-2013 21:31:52]  <Makoto> Oh!
[24-Mar-2013 21:31:59]  <Makoto> Okay, one point of strain then.
[24-Mar-2013 21:32:16]  <IllFlower> Done. 21 > 20, no response from the witch.
[24-Mar-2013 21:32:44]  <Makoto> All right. Finishing attack adds an extra... 
[24-Mar-2013 21:32:58]  <Makoto> uhm, d6+6 i think?

[24-Mar-2013 21:34:51]  * Makoto slams the butt end of her cannon into the ground. Everything around her seems to be growing slightly more colorful and vivid. Dramatic wind kicks up.
[24-Mar-2013 21:35:01]  <Yuna> O_O
[24-Mar-2013 21:36:34]  <Makoto> The cannon lets out a deafening report as it discharges. The blast kicks up grains of sand in concentric rings. The projectile, too bright to look at directly, vanishes up into the sky.
[24-Mar-2013 21:37:30]  <Yui> Wow, Makoto!
[24-Mar-2013 21:37:39]  <Sumire> "That was amazing."
[24-Mar-2013 21:37:50]  <Makoto> (i'm not done yet! >:|)
[24-Mar-2013 21:38:31]  <Makoto> There is a second loud explosion. The sound reaches the initiates a few seconds after they actually see the projectile burst. A shower of brilliantly colored comets rains down from the sky onto the witch, shredding its body to pieces.
[24-Mar-2013 21:39:32]  <Yuna> "Wooow.... she's really powerful..."
[24-Mar-2013 21:39:36]  <IllFlower> The liquid barrier behind the witch freezes and then explodes into a thin mist of ice.
[24-Mar-2013 21:40:06]  <IllFlower> The queen falls apart into shreds of paper that quickly dissolve away in the water like thin tissue.
[24-Mar-2013 21:40:42]  <IllFlower> The staff clatters to the ground. It decays right in front of the initiates' eyes, until it looks like nothing more than a simple piece of driftwood.
[24-Mar-2013 21:41:39]  <IllFlower> Yuna's flashlight makes a small "splash" on the water's surface as the oily sheen fades away, leaving nothing but the usual sea. **
[24-Mar-2013 21:41:56]  <Sumire> "So who here can swim?"
[24-Mar-2013 21:42:06]  * Yuna shivers a moment, looks side to side at the others, nods her head, and runs for the flashlight
[24-Mar-2013 21:42:41]  <IllFlower> Makoto has 6 Overcharge; you'll need to resolve that immediately with some sort of Fallout.
[24-Mar-2013 21:42:59]  <Sumire> 14you can distortion for three, flare for five, or change for six
[24-Mar-2013 21:43:24]  * Makoto sinks down to her knees. An aurora of light surrounds her as her cannon vanishes and her costume fades back into her regular clothes. She is breathing heavily, and clearly quite exhausted, but her usual manic grin is in full effect.
[24-Mar-2013 21:43:33]  <Makoto> Change for six.

[24-Mar-2013 21:50:50]  <Makoto> Probably the smart thing to do would have been to just take a distortion, but, eh. Just jumping in headlong seemed the most Makoto-y choice. >_>
[24-Mar-2013 21:51:24]  <IllFlower> Makoto: Done.
[24-Mar-2013 21:51:26]  * Yuna runs into the water, wincing as it gets her awkwardly wet and soaks her clothes, but even though she doesn't like water and doen't like getting wet it doesn't matter because she needs that back so it doesn't hurt anyone ever again run run run swim dive *GRAB*
[24-Mar-2013 21:52:04]  <Makoto> IllFlower: So are you just going to randomly subject Makoto to this, or should I have it happen whenever I feel it's appropriate? or some of column a, some of b?
[24-Mar-2013 21:52:37]  <IllFlower> Sumire: I think that'll be okay so long as the effects are deferred to the next episode you're in, not this one.
[24-Mar-2013 21:52:52]  <IllFlower> Makoto: The last one should be fine.
