[10-Jan-2013 02:21:02]  <IllFlower> okay, then we'll get this session started... now.
[10-Jan-2013 02:21:16]  *** Yoshimi <~Section@CPE18593345ef4c-CM18593345ef49.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has left #madokamadness
[10-Jan-2013 02:21:34]  <IllFlower> a dark night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets. but on the 12th floor of the Acme Building, one man *record scratch*
[10-Jan-2013 02:22:12]  *** EternalShrineMaiden <~cyberneti@c-76-111-78-241.hsd1.va.comcast.net> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Jan-2013 02:23:11]  <IllFlower> it's late. Yuna, Sumire, and Yui are gathered in a poorly-lit room around something on the ground.
[10-Jan-2013 02:23:31]  <IllFlower> that something happens to be Pyunpyun, sleeping as if he doesn't have a care in the world.
[10-Jan-2013 02:23:55]  <IllFlower> one suspects that he won't be waking up unless someone makes him wake up. **
[10-Jan-2013 02:24:18]  <Sumire> 14stupid question: what does the ** mean?
[10-Jan-2013 02:24:24]  <Cultist> 14"start talking"
[10-Jan-2013 02:24:38]  <Cultist> 14or rather, that his narration is done for now, and it's your turn to act.
[10-Jan-2013 02:24:50]  * Cultist 14dresses up in revealing magician's assistant outfit
[10-Jan-2013 02:25:15]  <IllFlower> Cultist = Vanna White
[10-Jan-2013 02:27:13]  <TragbarenRechner[empty]> 15don't be afraid to just say somethin', guys.
[10-Jan-2013 02:27:15]  <Yui> Hey Yuna, d'ya think Pyunpyun will wake up if we rub his tummy, or should we poke him with a stick?
[10-Jan-2013 02:27:48]  <Sumire> I'd go with the stick.  Who knows what germs or the like Pyunpyun has been in?
[10-Jan-2013 02:28:11]  * Yuna fidgets nervously.  "Um... are you sure we want to wake him up?  He must be really tired, sleeping like that."
[10-Jan-2013 02:28:41]  <Yui> or maybe he's just lazing about because he can.
[10-Jan-2013 02:28:57]  *** Yoshimi <~Section@CPE18593345ef4c-CM18593345ef49.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Jan-2013 02:29:06]  <Yoshimi> just gonna observe since what's her name is
[10-Jan-2013 02:29:08]  * Yoshimi shuts up
[10-Jan-2013 02:29:26]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun rolls over in his sleep, with a content look on his face. **
[10-Jan-2013 02:29:27]  <Yuna> ((What does the familiar look like again?))
[10-Jan-2013 02:30:12]  <IllFlower> you have no further directions than "cutesy-looking mishmash of every huggable animal in existence" with a "long, feathery tail."
[10-Jan-2013 02:31:09]  <Yui> Hey, you, since you approved of the stick plan, you wouldn't happen to have one on you, would you?
[10-Jan-2013 02:31:16]  * Yuna tlits her head to the side and looks more closely at the Pyunpyun.  "I guess I can believe that.  He does look a little bit like a cat."
[10-Jan-2013 02:31:50]  <Sumire> Hmm, I don't think so.  Maybe somewhere nearby though?
[10-Jan-2013 02:31:53]  <IllFlower> you can basically assume he looks like Kyuubey, really. maybe scratch the compound-ear thing.
[10-Jan-2013 02:31:55]  <Sumire> 14Hey, what sort of room are we in?
[10-Jan-2013 02:32:13]  * TragbarenRechner[empty] 15remembers the sneezing picture
[10-Jan-2013 02:32:16]  <Yuna> I could poke him with my flashlight, maybe that'll do?
[10-Jan-2013 02:32:33]  <IllFlower> concrete walls, no particular adornment. it doesn't look like someplace people would choose to occupy for very long. maybe that's why Pyunpyun likes it.
[10-Jan-2013 02:33:02]  <IllFlower> there's a television in the corner, low volume, playing some variety show. it's dark enough that the television's a noticeable source of light. **
[10-Jan-2013 02:33:16]  <Yui> Try the flashlight, Yuna. Worst case scenario, he swats it, right?
[10-Jan-2013 02:33:47]  <Yui> I mean it's not like something that fluffy could be terribly vicious in its sleep
[10-Jan-2013 02:34:19]  <Sumire> You never know, Yui; have you ever dealt with a cat wanting food?
[10-Jan-2013 02:34:35]  * Yuna nervously pulls the little mag-lite out of her purse and pokes it gently against the familiar's stomach, then turns it on and waves it a couple times at its closed eyes.  "Rise and shine, Pyun-Pyun~"
[10-Jan-2013 02:35:50]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun rubs his eyes with a furry paw. "mmmmhh..."
[10-Jan-2013 02:36:31]  <Yui> I haven't dealt with a cat wanting food, no. But I can't remember dealing with you either, so perhaps it's just slipped my mind.
[10-Jan-2013 02:36:46]  <IllFlower> he snaps his eyes open and bats the flashlight out of Yuna's hand, causing the beam to skitter away from his face.
[10-Jan-2013 02:36:56]  <Sumire> No, I don't think we've actually formally met.
[10-Jan-2013 02:37:03]  * Sumire extends hand to Yui
[10-Jan-2013 02:37:18]  <Sumire> My name's Sumire Shirayuki!  What's yours?
[10-Jan-2013 02:37:26]  <IllFlower> "I get it, I get it. you don't have to shine that in my eyes. what, was there something wrong?"
[10-Jan-2013 02:37:32]  * Yuna eeps and chases after her flashlight, quickly picking it back up and stuffing it in her purse.
[10-Jan-2013 02:37:54]  * Yui tentatively takes Sumire's hand. I'm Yui. That's Yuna. She's one of my best friends.
[10-Jan-2013 02:38:26]  <Sumire> Nice to meet you, Yui!  Looks like Pyunpyun's up; we should probably head over there
[10-Jan-2013 02:38:30]  <Yuna> U-um... I was just trying to wake you up, Pyun-Pyun!  The other two seemed to want to...
[10-Jan-2013 02:38:44]  <Cultist> 14oh sure, blame your "friends"
[10-Jan-2013 02:39:22]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun stands on all four of his feet and takes a look around. his eyes fall first on Yuna, then Yui and Sumire.
[10-Jan-2013 02:39:40]  <IllFlower> "oh, oh, right, the new... the new... how did you guys find your way here?"
[10-Jan-2013 02:39:50]  <IllFlower> **
[10-Jan-2013 02:40:05]  <Yui> idle curiosity can be a terrible thing, fluffball
[10-Jan-2013 02:41:30]  <Yuna> We were just... sneaking around a little bit...
[10-Jan-2013 02:42:13]  <IllFlower> "well, if you're waking me up, it must be long past time for me to show you girls the ropes."
[10-Jan-2013 02:42:57]  <Yui> Please tell me they aren't the sort that hang from the ceiling
[10-Jan-2013 02:43:00]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun wanders over to the television screen, then paws the remote control until he arrives at something resembling a map.
[10-Jan-2013 02:43:20]  <Sumire> Is that the city?
[10-Jan-2013 02:43:44]  <IllFlower> it doesn't look like any part of the city anybody recognizes. certainly, the roads aren't quite so twisted as this.
[10-Jan-2013 02:45:22]  <IllFlower> "oh, yeah, that's the city. it's a way of locating witches."
[10-Jan-2013 02:45:53]  <Yuna> That
[10-Jan-2013 02:46:01]  <Sumire> Witches...those are the things you recruited us to fight, isn't it?
[10-Jan-2013 02:46:01]  <IllFlower> it's puzzling how anyone could locate anything on this map, really, but it's probably best not to nitpick over this. **
[10-Jan-2013 02:46:03]  <Yui> Whadda ya mean "witches"? Like halloween and fairy talkes?
[10-Jan-2013 02:46:11]  <Yuna> *That's a map of the city...?  I've seen maps of the city, they don't look that much like that...
[10-Jan-2013 02:46:31]  <IllFlower> "I thought you all already knew?" **
[10-Jan-2013 02:46:52]  <Yuna> They're the monsters that live inside Nightmares, right?
[10-Jan-2013 02:47:20]  <Yui> OH! Those things, right. Sorry. 
[10-Jan-2013 02:47:50]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun ignores the girls' response, instead laying a paw on the screen.
[10-Jan-2013 02:48:22]  <IllFlower> "here. the shopping district a few blocks from here."
[10-Jan-2013 02:48:37]  <Sumire> The shopping district?  But all the people, won't we be noticed?
[10-Jan-2013 02:48:53]  <IllFlower> "what time of night do you think it is right now?"
[10-Jan-2013 02:51:03]  <Yui> Not late enough for everyone to be off the streets, we're only teenagers. Our parents would hardly approve of us being out in the middle of the night without warning or permission!
[10-Jan-2013 02:51:17]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun moves on. "it looks likely there's a witch in one of the back alleys there. if you're still unclear on what a witch is, well, you'll be seeing one in person soon."
[10-Jan-2013 02:52:04]  * Yuna shudders as she remembers what little she saw of a witch not so long ago.
[10-Jan-2013 02:52:23]  * Yui reaches out for Yuna's hand
[10-Jan-2013 02:52:51]  <Sumire> Are you okay, Yuna?  Just keep your chin up and think of something happy, like chocolate!
[10-Jan-2013 02:53:25]  * Yuna reaches out and holds Yui's hand and forces a smile.  "Chocolate...  chocolate sounds good!  Maybe this witch will give us chocolate if we defeat it."
[10-Jan-2013 02:53:32]  <IllFlower> "in any case, you three should head down there," Pyunpyun continues, seemingly ignoring Yuna's shaken state. "we'll have a problem if that witch is still there come morning."
[10-Jan-2013 02:54:02]  <IllFlower> **
[10-Jan-2013 02:54:37]  <Sumire> I guess it's time to go to the shopping district, then!
[10-Jan-2013 02:54:53]  <Sumire> Do either of you know your way to the shopping district from...wherever we are?
[10-Jan-2013 02:55:06]  <Yuna> A problem...? What sort of problem?
[10-Jan-2013 02:55:32]  <IllFlower> "I would think you of all people would least need to ask that question." **
[10-Jan-2013 02:55:38]  <Yui> ... I think it's to the left. Or right. I'm really bad at remembering which is which, Sumire.
[10-Jan-2013 02:56:55]  * Yuna blinks a few times, trying not to look too distraught.  She was hoping that wasn't how things normally worked out, but...
[10-Jan-2013 02:56:57]  <IllFlower> (Yui = double-headed monster from Sesame Street)
[10-Jan-2013 02:57:35]  <Yuna> Um... I think I remember the way, at least I'm pretty sure?
[10-Jan-2013 02:58:15]  <Sumire> That's good.  You can be our navigator!  Lead on,....Yuuu-na?
[10-Jan-2013 02:58:15]  <Yui> Let's go, then. Before that overgrown hairball says something even more callous and aloof.
[10-Jan-2013 02:58:52]  <IllFlower> "well, good luck. I'm going to head back to sleep." Pyunpyun promptly curls up in a ball and returns to his original folded-up position. **
[10-Jan-2013 02:59:19]  <Yuna> Yes, Yuna!  And you're... you're Sumire, right?
[10-Jan-2013 03:00:55]  <Sumire> Yeah, Sumire.  It's nice to meet you, though I suspect it would be better in less...weird...circumstances.
[10-Jan-2013 03:01:35]  <Yuna> Y-yeah... that was a bit of a... limited introduction
[10-Jan-2013 03:01:52]  * Yui hums "We're Off to See the Wizard"
[10-Jan-2013 03:02:03]  <Yuna> You were right Yui, he really /is/ lazy.  Too lazy to even explain much of anything to us!
[10-Jan-2013 03:02:04]  <IllFlower> if you care to attempt to build a relationship here, you can try to Bond as indicated on page 15.
[10-Jan-2013 03:02:21]  <Cultist> 14the most sterile call for friendship i ever done seen
[10-Jan-2013 03:02:40]  <Yuna> ((For our reference, how do we do rolls int his channel?)
[10-Jan-2013 03:02:45]  <IllFlower> +roll d6
[10-Jan-2013 03:02:45]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 6=6
[10-Jan-2013 03:02:49]  <Yuna> ((Thanks!))
[10-Jan-2013 03:02:52]  <IllFlower> (natural)
[10-Jan-2013 03:03:16]  <TragbarenRechner[empty]> 15with a gurgle, the friendship explodes into messy gore from the strike.
[10-Jan-2013 03:03:54]  <IllFlower> Cultist: "should you wish to proceed with a Camaraderie Establishment Attempt, please press 2 now."
[10-Jan-2013 03:04:25]  <Yuna> ((Um, I'm going to try to bond with Sumire, so that means I roll social+2d6, right?))
[10-Jan-2013 03:04:33]  <Yuna> ((Sorry, still just getting used to this.))
[10-Jan-2013 03:04:57]  <Sumire> 14I think that's how it works, yeah
[10-Jan-2013 03:04:59]  <IllFlower> yes.
[10-Jan-2013 03:05:23]  <IllFlower> in your case, it'd be 2d6+5.
[10-Jan-2013 03:05:37]  <Yuna> +roll 2d6+5
[10-Jan-2013 03:05:38]  <rollermine> Yuna: (1+3)+5=9
[10-Jan-2013 03:05:52]  <IllFlower> <12, so no effect, sorry.
[10-Jan-2013 03:05:55]  <Yuna> ((I failed to start a relationship ._.  Oh well, better luck in the future!))
[10-Jan-2013 03:06:27]  <IllFlower> ("Sumire and Yuna maintain awkward distance for the rest of the episode.")
[10-Jan-2013 03:06:27]  <Yuna> ((Um, is anyone else going to bond or something, or are we off to the shopping area?))
[10-Jan-2013 03:06:43]  <IllFlower> nobody else can; the other two sides of this triangle are filled in.
[10-Jan-2013 03:07:05]  <IllFlower> oh, wait, no, Yui and Sumire don't... huh, well.
[10-Jan-2013 03:07:52]  <IllFlower> (meanwhile, music: "WE'VE LOST POWER! WE'VE LOST POWER!! *sirens*")
[10-Jan-2013 03:08:20]  <Yui> +roll 2d6+7
[10-Jan-2013 03:08:21]  <rollermine> Yui: (5+2)+7=14
[10-Jan-2013 03:08:41]  <Yuna> ((music??))
[10-Jan-2013 03:08:52]  <IllFlower> okay, one charge for Yui. presumably you use this to build a relationship with Sumire?
[10-Jan-2013 03:09:07]  <Yui> yes.
[10-Jan-2013 03:09:18]  <IllFlower> attribute: Heart, Magic, Fury?
[10-Jan-2013 03:09:31]  <Yui> mmm Magic
[10-Jan-2013 03:10:04]  <IllFlower> and done, on the last row of the relationships chart.
[10-Jan-2013 03:10:15]  <IllFlower> okay, shall we head out, then?
[10-Jan-2013 03:10:33]  <Sumire> Hey, Yui.  I hope I didn't come off too strong over there; I think I freaked Yuna out a bit.  Ready for this witch stuff?
[10-Jan-2013 03:11:21]  <Yui> Yuna had a bad run in before, Sumire. She just doesn't want anything bad to happen to anyone ever, essentially.
[10-Jan-2013 03:11:38]  <IllFlower> Yui: the music I'm listening to has samples from black box recordings of plane crashes. like I said, dark.
[10-Jan-2013 03:12:15]  <Sumire> Oooooh.  Well, I guess we should make sure nothing bad happens!
[10-Jan-2013 03:12:23]  <Yui> I wouldn't worry too much, she'll come around. I'm ready to kick butt, I know she's got my back, and we can't possibly go wrong with someone as chipper as you!
[10-Jan-2013 03:12:29]  <Yuna> Nonono, Sumire, it's not your fault!  Pyunpyun just freaked me out a little bit...
[10-Jan-2013 03:12:35]  <IllFlower> * Yuna: (I have a feeling this isn't the last time I'll make that mistake.)
[10-Jan-2013 03:13:10]  <Yuna> ((Sorry, Illflowie!))
[10-Jan-2013 03:13:13]  <Sumire> 14She says, not knowing in-character what we all know out-of-character, that the game is based on Madoka Magica
[10-Jan-2013 03:13:33]  <IllFlower> the three girls head out from the concrete building that Pyunpyun calls "home," walking down a set of rickety metal steps onto the deserted streets below.
[10-Jan-2013 03:14:13]  <IllFlower> on second thought, the fact that none of them were frightened at the prospect of doing this on the way up, long past sunset, may have been a bit odd, but nobody notices.
[10-Jan-2013 03:15:12]  <IllFlower> they pass by a series of houses, some with lights on, some without, but invariably no people are visible in the windows.
[10-Jan-2013 03:15:40]  <IllFlower> after passing the time with some light conversation, the girls arrive at the shopping district.
[10-Jan-2013 03:15:50]  <Yui> (in theory Yuna has a flashlight, so it's not like we were necessarily climbing without light)
[10-Jan-2013 03:16:34]  <IllFlower> all of the shops have been closed for some time, and the storefront shutters are barricaded. a few newspapers sit on a table next to a sign advertising cheap oranges.
[10-Jan-2013 03:16:47]  <IllFlower> **
[10-Jan-2013 03:17:34]  <Yui> I wonder which alley Pyunpyun meant. They all look pretty desolate to me.
[10-Jan-2013 03:17:37]  <Yuna> Supposedly there's a witch here... but it looks pretty normal to me, at least at first glance.
[10-Jan-2013 03:18:08]  <Yuna> ((Is this a relevant place to use a Locate check?))
[10-Jan-2013 03:18:13]  <Sumire> It looks kinda creepy, but then, all places do at this time of night.
[10-Jan-2013 03:18:28]  <IllFlower> Yuna: nope, not yet.
[10-Jan-2013 03:19:02]  <IllFlower> for a moment or two, it looks like nothing's happening, but then a human figure lumbers out of one of the side alleys.
[10-Jan-2013 03:19:25]  <Yui> H-hello?
[10-Jan-2013 03:19:27]  <Sumire> Did you two see something?
[10-Jan-2013 03:20:04]  <Yui> I at least heard something...
[10-Jan-2013 03:20:09]  <IllFlower> male, in perhaps his mid-twenties, fairly well-built, wearing a shipping company cap, and - apparently - completely oblivious to sight or sound.
[10-Jan-2013 03:20:23]  <Yuna> ((I think we should wait until the ** to say things))
[10-Jan-2013 03:20:35]  <Sumire> 14oops, yeah we should
[10-Jan-2013 03:20:49]  <Yui> (sorry nemo)
[10-Jan-2013 03:20:56]  <IllFlower> he continues walking, seemingly aimlessly, towards the three girls. **
[10-Jan-2013 03:21:10]  <IllFlower> (meh, I'll tell you to stop if I need you to stop)
[10-Jan-2013 03:21:17]  <Cultist> 14that hardly seems very aimless
[10-Jan-2013 03:21:29]  <Sumire> Hello?  Are you drunk?
[10-Jan-2013 03:21:41]  <IllFlower> Cultist: the idea is that he doesn't seem to know where he's going.
[10-Jan-2013 03:21:55]  * Yui edges closer to Yuna
[10-Jan-2013 03:21:56]  <IllFlower> Sumire: he gives no response, only continues to shuffle closer.
[10-Jan-2013 03:22:14]  * Yuna fidgets nervously with her fingers and shuffles slightly towards Yuil.
[10-Jan-2013 03:22:18]  <Yuna> *Yui.
[10-Jan-2013 03:23:23]  <IllFlower> the man's now close enough that his eyes are clearly visible. they're rolled back towards the sky, his jaw slightly ajar.
[10-Jan-2013 03:23:38]  <Yui> Y-yuna... now's not the time to panic, right? It's just some harmless guy. Nothing we and our pink haired companion should say, back away from? Or perhaps not so harmless
[10-Jan-2013 03:23:52]  <Yuna> He... he looks almost like a zombie... I wonder if he's on drugs or something
[10-Jan-2013 03:24:03]  <Yui> Sumire? Any theories?
[10-Jan-2013 03:24:46]  <Sumire> I dunno, but even if it's a guy on drugs, it could be pretty crazy; I heard some news story in America about a guy who was high on some new designer drug and ate someone's face off.
[10-Jan-2013 03:25:16]  <IllFlower> "things that actually happened? in my Magical Burst?" "it's more likely than you think!"
[10-Jan-2013 03:25:40]  <Sumire> 14Well, except for the part where that guy wasn't actually on bath salts, but yeah
[10-Jan-2013 03:25:46]  <Yuna> Th-that sounds really scary Sumire!
[10-Jan-2013 03:25:51]  <Yui> I kinda like my face where it is!
[10-Jan-2013 03:26:28]  <IllFlower> suddenly, as he comes within about three meters of the girls, he collapses, falling face-first to the ground. a glowing mark is visible at the back of his neck, which nobody could see before.
[10-Jan-2013 03:27:04]  <IllFlower> the mark is triangular, with some sort of intricate design within reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts.
[10-Jan-2013 03:27:15]  <IllFlower> **
[10-Jan-2013 03:27:44]  * Yuna carefully steps up and looks at the mark.  "It's... it's glowing... this has to be magic, right?  This doesn't look like anything normal..."
[10-Jan-2013 03:27:56]  <IllFlower> (Yuna, you recall seeing something like this on the skin of the people in the train...)
[10-Jan-2013 03:28:01]  * Yui steps gingerly towards the body to join Yuna
[10-Jan-2013 03:28:12]  <Yuna> "It's... it's..."
[10-Jan-2013 03:28:26]  <Yuna> "It's just like that time...."
[10-Jan-2013 03:28:33]  <Sumire> That time?
[10-Jan-2013 03:28:36]  <Yui> so not glow in the dark paint then
[10-Jan-2013 03:28:44]  <IllFlower> (I hate to possibly give Yuna PTSD, but she's the only one with any witch experience.)
[10-Jan-2013 03:29:06]  <Yuna> Um... I guess I need to explain this at some point...!
[10-Jan-2013 03:29:18]  <Cultist> 14now seems like a good time for exposition
[10-Jan-2013 03:29:40]  <IllFlower> I'll take this part, Yuna, as the GM.
[10-Jan-2013 03:29:51]  <Yuna> (aww.  okay)
[10-Jan-2013 03:30:04]  *** SpruceZeus is now known as SpruceZeus|away
[10-Jan-2013 03:30:11]  <IllFlower> Yuna explains how the last time she saw a mark like this was when the train she was on was attacked by a witch.
[10-Jan-2013 03:30:43]  <IllFlower> it seems to indicate some kind of possession, or at least a attack on the psyche.
[10-Jan-2013 03:31:20]  <IllFlower> (now you can take it away with your reaction to that incident, Yuna.)
[10-Jan-2013 03:32:20]  <Yuna> I think it's some kind of mark of a witch... if this man had one on him, there has to be a witch around here too!
[10-Jan-2013 03:32:30]  <IllFlower> (or any of you, really.)
[10-Jan-2013 03:32:50]  <Yuna> Which I guess makes sense... Pyun-Pyun probably wasn't sending us here for no reason.
[10-Jan-2013 03:33:05]  <Sumire> If this guy found us, our witch is probably very close nearby.
[10-Jan-2013 03:33:30]  <Sumire> Pyunpyun's explanations are pretty incomprehensible, but I think I know what we need to do now.
[10-Jan-2013 03:34:08]  <IllFlower> not so much "found" as "happened to randomly stumble near," but I guess that's not really material when it looks like a zombie is coming for you. ;)
[10-Jan-2013 03:34:14]  *** AttObl is now known as AttObl|ADOMII
[10-Jan-2013 03:34:31]  <Sumire> TRANSFORM!
[10-Jan-2013 03:35:08]  *** SpruceZeus|away is now known as SpruceZeus
[10-Jan-2013 03:35:50]  <IllFlower> a pink light briefly envelops Sumire, and she emerges in her white chandelier dress.
[10-Jan-2013 03:36:38]  <IllFlower> apparently the "candles" are actually glowing, too, though it's not fire. how odd. **
[10-Jan-2013 03:37:27]  * Yuna steps back, surprised.  "Wow... pretty!"
[10-Jan-2013 03:38:11]  <Yui> Sumire! Your dress is as sparkly as your attitude! Wait, can personalities be sparkly? I don't even know, but I agree with Yuna!
[10-Jan-2013 03:38:31]  <IllFlower> while it is pretty, it may not be wise to stand around admiring it at the moment. :p
[10-Jan-2013 03:38:49]  <Yuna> I... I guess I should do the same?
[10-Jan-2013 03:39:05]  * Yuna follows Sumire's lead and transforms
[10-Jan-2013 03:40:01]  * Yui wrinkles her nose "here goes nothing... TRANSFORM"
[10-Jan-2013 03:40:15]  <IllFlower> Yuna's light is purple (what else would it be?). the galaxies and stars seem to swirl on the dress she comes out in.
[10-Jan-2013 03:40:56]  <Sumire> Woah, Yuna.  I think if there weren't actual danger around, I could stare at your dress for hours!
[10-Jan-2013 03:41:16]  <IllFlower> then Yui is bathed in a yellow light, and comes out in her costume. the lack of glowing things for me to describe seems almost disappointing. :p
[10-Jan-2013 03:41:51]  <IllFlower> (yuri goggles, go)
[10-Jan-2013 03:41:58]  <Yui> (we can't all be acupuncturists)

[10-Jan-2013 03:42:34]  *** JackMackerel is now known as Athena_Lenway
[10-Jan-2013 03:42:48]  <Yuna> T-thank you, Sumire... but um... now that we're prepared like this... what do we do next?
[10-Jan-2013 03:42:59]  <IllFlower> the alley that the shipping worker came out of might perhaps be a good start.
[10-Jan-2013 03:43:03]  <Yui> Hey Yuna, I think the dude stumbled out from over there, right?
[10-Jan-2013 03:43:15]  <IllFlower> (Yui knows what's cooking.)
[10-Jan-2013 03:43:18]  * Yui gestures with her rolling pin
[10-Jan-2013 03:43:39]  <Yuna> Yeah... I guess if he had a witch's mark on him, the witch must be wherever he came from.  Makes sense!
[10-Jan-2013 03:43:51]  <Sumire> Sounds good to me.  You guys ready to go?
[10-Jan-2013 03:44:06]  <Yuna> Yup!  Not much point in standing here waiting...
[10-Jan-2013 03:44:32]  * Yui smacks the rolling pin down into her palm. So let's stop standing and get to running!
[10-Jan-2013 03:44:34]  <IllFlower> 「いちいち断らんくてもいいって」
[10-Jan-2013 03:44:50]  * Yuna follows Yui eagerly.
[10-Jan-2013 03:44:51]  *** Athena_Lenway <~JackMacke@75-51-144-130.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net> has left #madokamadness
[10-Jan-2013 03:45:00]  * Sumire also follows eagerly behind Yui
[10-Jan-2013 03:45:11]  <IllFlower> the three girls start down the alley that the man emerged from. it's not a very long alley, and ends in a T with another, broader alley out behind the shops.
[10-Jan-2013 03:45:46]  <IllFlower> it looks like the back entrances are here, for unloading goods and such.
[10-Jan-2013 03:46:50]  <IllFlower> a small truck is parked behind one of the stores, some boxes stacked on its bed.
[10-Jan-2013 03:47:01]  <Sumire> So which way, left or right?
[10-Jan-2013 03:47:25]  <IllFlower> it looks like one box has been dropped on the ground. a few cabbages are scattered along the alley.
[10-Jan-2013 03:47:43]  <IllFlower> the faint sound of laughter echoes from beyond the truck. **
[10-Jan-2013 03:47:58]  <Yui> I say we follow the cabbages
[10-Jan-2013 03:48:01]  <Yuna> Wasn't that man wearing a shipping company cap?  This looks like it might be his truck...
[10-Jan-2013 03:48:20]  <Sumire> ...I think I hear something around the truck.  We probably should go that way, yeah.
[10-Jan-2013 03:48:31]  <Yuna> me too... I hear an awful weird sound...
[10-Jan-2013 03:48:53]  <IllFlower> sure enough, the words "Arimiya Shipping Co." are stenciled on the side of the truck.
[10-Jan-2013 03:49:26]  * Yuna steps carefully towards and around the truck.
[10-Jan-2013 03:49:37]  <Yui> Hey Sumire, if we die, make sure it's a good death
[10-Jan-2013 03:49:58]  <IllFlower> as you approach the truck, the laughter gets louder and louder, becoming intermixed with the sound of giggles, as if there were a chorus of sinister figures somewhere nearby.
[10-Jan-2013 03:50:04]  <Yuna> I-if... if we die?   No, we can't... don't talk about dying, we're not going to die!
[10-Jan-2013 03:50:04]  <Sumire> I will do my best, uh....crap, what was your name again?  I'm so sorry, I'm bad with names.
[10-Jan-2013 03:50:07]  <Yuna> Especially not you, Yui!
[10-Jan-2013 03:50:21]  <IllFlower> you guys get along so well.
[10-Jan-2013 03:50:49]  <Yui> Haha, everyone always forgets! if it's easier, I'll answer to Yuyu
[10-Jan-2013 03:50:50]  <IllFlower> ("what are you talking about?!")
[10-Jan-2013 03:51:12]  <Yui> I"m sorry, Yuna, I was just trying to lighten the mood!
[10-Jan-2013 03:51:26]  <Yui> I know we aren't going to die
[10-Jan-2013 03:51:30]  <IllFlower> (she'll answer to Mayu, even!)
[10-Jan-2013 03:51:55]  <Yuna> Dying doesn't seem very mood-lightning... b-but... let's not stand around here!
[10-Jan-2013 03:52:12]  <Yui> Right, that laughter is starting to really creep me out!
[10-Jan-2013 03:52:15]  * Yuna steps closer to the laughter, looking around frantically to try to locate the source of the sounds.
[10-Jan-2013 03:52:52]  <IllFlower> as the three girls round the truck, they see that its driver's-side door is...
[10-Jan-2013 03:53:14]  <IllFlower> well, "missing" wouldn't be the right word. it's been... assimilated into some kind of odd portal.
[10-Jan-2013 03:53:44]  <Yuna> That... that must be the entrance to the Nightmare!
[10-Jan-2013 03:53:45]  <IllFlower> the laughter seems to be coming from beyond its swirling, black-and-orange vortex.
[10-Jan-2013 03:54:00]  *** TOKAM <~TOKAM@107.45.246.19> has joined #madokamadness

[10-Jan-2013 03:55:04]  <Yui> Operation poke it with a stick mark two, Sumire?
[10-Jan-2013 03:55:19]  <IllFlower> (banter while you still can, my pretties! while you still can...)
[10-Jan-2013 03:55:20]  <Yuna> Getting the insurance company to believe -this- might be a tad difficult...

[10-Jan-2013 03:55:51]  <IllFlower> the rock goes into the portal. **
[10-Jan-2013 03:56:17]  <Yuna> It looks like we can go through.... or at least a rock can.  Um... do you two feel ready?

[10-Jan-2013 03:59:36]  <IllFlower> Sumire suddenly has flashbacks to an anime she saw once and starts singing, but the other girls just look at her strangely...
[10-Jan-2013 04:00:00]  <IllFlower> anyway, the portal is ready when you are.
[10-Jan-2013 04:00:28]  * Yui takes a deep breath and steps forward
[10-Jan-2013 04:00:39]  * Yuna steps forward with Yui.
[10-Jan-2013 04:00:43]  <Yuna> On a count of 3, okay?
[10-Jan-2013 04:00:47]  * Sumire also steps forward
[10-Jan-2013 04:00:54]  <Yui> count of 3
[10-Jan-2013 04:01:00]  <Yuna> 3... 2... 1...
[10-Jan-2013 04:01:04]  <Yuna> Let's go!
[10-Jan-2013 04:02:34]  <IllFlower> as the girls step through the portal, the sounds of the city suddenly die away, replaced by a low, irregular growl.
[10-Jan-2013 04:03:33]  <IllFlower> they appear to have walked into a giant cave made of origami figures. a few animated cranes float across a technicolor pond.
[10-Jan-2013 04:04:01]  <IllFlower> the laughter that drew the girls here is nowhere to be heard any more. **
[10-Jan-2013 04:04:53]  <Yui> This would be almost pretty, if it weren't for the fact that it sounds like Ami when she doesn't want to wake up.
[10-Jan-2013 04:05:10]  <Sumire> Ami?
[10-Jan-2013 04:05:36]  <Yui> My little cousin, I watch her from time to time.
[10-Jan-2013 04:05:42]  <IllFlower> I don't think young girls are capable of making such guttural sounds. ;)
[10-Jan-2013 04:06:29]  <Yui> (I don't think  you know young girls... also growling is vague. tummies and tigers both do it >:|)
[10-Jan-2013 04:06:47]  <IllFlower> a long, tense stillness pervades the maze, the origami animals twisting themselves around in their bizarre animation.
[10-Jan-2013 04:07:26]  <Yuna> ... this place is creepy ...
[10-Jan-2013 04:07:39]  <Yuna> At least we can see, though.  That's a plus.
[10-Jan-2013 04:08:13]  <Yui> Seeing is definitely on the plus side
[10-Jan-2013 04:08:17]  <Sumire> That it is.  Now if only we could see anything useful.
[10-Jan-2013 04:08:44]  <IllFlower> slowly, the growls begin to change into... something else, almost a strained feline yowl.
[10-Jan-2013 04:09:27]  <IllFlower> they no longer sound like they're coming from someplace off in the distance, either, but as if they're approaching... approaching from... **
[10-Jan-2013 04:09:56]  <Yuna> ((Is this a time for a Locate check or similar?))
[10-Jan-2013 04:10:05]  <Yui> maybe we should stand back to back in a triangle, guys
[10-Jan-2013 04:10:09]  <Yuna> ((I gues in D&D I'd do a spot check))
[10-Jan-2013 04:10:27]  <Sumire> 14Locate is for things in the city, I think
[10-Jan-2013 04:10:31]  <Yuna> y-yeah... whatever it is, it's getting close... *gets into position*
[10-Jan-2013 04:10:53]  * Sumire points magical wand in threatening pose
[10-Jan-2013 04:12:10]  <IllFlower> suddenly a huge tiger-like blaze of color erupts from the pond, scattering the cranes into the air. as they land, they hit the ground with a heavy "thud," twitching as if injured.
[10-Jan-2013 04:12:24]  * Yui gulps and clutches the end of her rolling pin
[10-Jan-2013 04:12:47]  * Yuna shudders and holds her flashlight-wand tightly.
[10-Jan-2013 04:13:16]  <Yui> w-well, at least now we know what we're up against, right?
[10-Jan-2013 04:13:23]  <Yui> A tiger made of rainbows
[10-Jan-2013 04:13:28]  <IllFlower> the witch almost seems to be made of fire, orange and red and darting around the cave as if it's physically incapable of staying still, or moving any more slowly than a blur.
[10-Jan-2013 04:13:56]  <IllFlower> the only indication that it's not actually aflame is that the origami crafts don't instantly light themselves.
[10-Jan-2013 04:14:29]  <IllFlower> we now have a battle. if you'll all turn to page 16 and select your attack, defense, and support attributes for this turn, we'll begin.
[10-Jan-2013 04:14:47]  <Yuna> (A:3 D:6 S:9)
[10-Jan-2013 04:15:06]  <IllFlower> Yuna: could you indicate which attribute as well?
[10-Jan-2013 04:15:17]  <Yuna> (I'm going to try to read the enemy -- that means I do that instead of attacking, right?)
[10-Jan-2013 04:15:19]  <Sumire> (A: Mg 8; D: Ht 7; S: Fr 3)
[10-Jan-2013 04:15:20]  <IllFlower> I can look up the numbers when they're needed.
[10-Jan-2013 04:15:58]  <Yuna> (A:Fr D:Mg S:Ht)
[10-Jan-2013 04:16:16]  <Yui> (A: Mg 6 D:Ht 7 S:Fr 4)
[10-Jan-2013 04:16:37]  <IllFlower> okay, Sumire acts first. what do you do?
[10-Jan-2013 04:16:45]  <IllFlower> * does she
[10-Jan-2013 04:16:53]  <Yuna> (Wait, Yui, yours don't add up to 18)
[10-Jan-2013 04:17:05]  <Yuna> (8 heart, right?)
[10-Jan-2013 04:17:08]  <IllFlower> 6/8/4, she typoed.
[10-Jan-2013 04:17:18]  <Yuna> (oh, okay)
[10-Jan-2013 04:17:41]  <Yui> (sorry nemo)
[10-Jan-2013 04:17:51]  <IllFlower> no worries.
[10-Jan-2013 04:18:22]  * Sumire immediately attacks the tiger-like beast

[10-Jan-2013 04:20:30]  <IllFlower> that's a hit for you, Sumire.
[10-Jan-2013 04:20:43]  <IllFlower> describe it as you see fit. meanwhile...
[10-Jan-2013 04:20:56]  <IllFlower> +roll d6+4
[10-Jan-2013 04:20:56]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 1+4=5
[10-Jan-2013 04:21:23]  <IllFlower> you're up next, Yui.
[10-Jan-2013 04:22:16]  <Sumire> Sumire spins; before anyone notices, she is already several feet away with no trace of footsteps.  She extends her wand towards the tiger, and after screaming a kiai, a flash emerges from the wand, striking the monster.
[10-Jan-2013 04:22:59]  <IllFlower> the beast gives a feral scream and stops dead in its tracks, staggering for a momenbt or two.
[10-Jan-2013 04:24:22]  <IllFlower> Yui?
[10-Jan-2013 04:24:23]  <Yui> (sorry grabbing seizure meds)
[10-Jan-2013 04:25:00]  <IllFlower> take your time.
[10-Jan-2013 04:27:25]  <Yui> (Emily pounced and cut her gum on something in my hand, the perils of younger sisters, lemme tell you)
[10-Jan-2013 04:28:10]  <IllFlower> oh, dear.
[10-Jan-2013 04:28:28]  <Sumire> 14is she okay?
[10-Jan-2013 04:28:28]  <Yui> it seemed to work for Sumire, so I suppose there's no harm in following suit. Stay strong, Yuna!
[10-Jan-2013 04:28:41]  * Yui attacks as well
[10-Jan-2013 04:29:00]  <IllFlower> 2d6+Mg for you as well = 2d6+6
[10-Jan-2013 04:29:12]  <Yui> +roll 2d6+6
[10-Jan-2013 04:29:12]  <rollermine> Yui: (3+3)+6=12
[10-Jan-2013 04:29:35]  <IllFlower> +roll 2d6+5
[10-Jan-2013 04:29:35]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (6+4)+5=15
[10-Jan-2013 04:29:46]  <Yui> (this is gonna hurt)
[10-Jan-2013 04:29:54]  <IllFlower> attack fails. just that, though.
[10-Jan-2013 04:30:02]  <IllFlower> go ahead and describe what happens.
[10-Jan-2013 04:33:12]  <IllFlower> in any case, the big cat rises on its feet, its attention drawn by Yui's unsuccessful attack. it doesn't have a visible face in its waves of red and orange, but it's clearly looking at the girls.
[10-Jan-2013 04:33:16]  <Yui> Yui takes a strong stance, swings her rolling pin, and trips slightly. Whatever sparkles she was expecting to hit, shoot up like fireworks and nothing more
[10-Jan-2013 04:34:01]  <IllFlower> witch attacks next. I'm going to take the option to attack multiple targets: Yui, then Sumire, then Yuna, in that order.
[10-Jan-2013 04:34:02]  <Yui> (she's okay. she's lying on top of me saying "hi illflower" and "hi fiora" over and over and biting my shirt and saying "chomp")
[10-Jan-2013 04:34:12]  <IllFlower> hi, Emily!
[10-Jan-2013 04:34:20]  <Sumire> 4no hi to me? >:|
[10-Jan-2013 04:34:24]  <Sumire> 14oops, wrong number
[10-Jan-2013 04:34:45]  <Yui> ("I don't like you")
[10-Jan-2013 04:34:51]  <IllFlower> +roll 2d6+4
[10-Jan-2013 04:34:51]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (3+1)+4=8
[10-Jan-2013 04:35:08]  <Yuna> ((Hi Candy Heart!))
[10-Jan-2013 04:35:13]  <IllFlower> oh, haha, wow. this witch isn't very good at attacking.
[10-Jan-2013 04:35:36]  <Yui> (for some things we can be grateful)
[10-Jan-2013 04:35:48]  <IllFlower> all three of you have to make a defensive challenge. Yuna has the option of clashing.
[10-Jan-2013 04:36:20]  <Sumire> +roll 2d6+7
[10-Jan-2013 04:36:21]  <rollermine> Sumire: (1+3)+7=11
[10-Jan-2013 04:37:03]  <Yui> +roll 2d6+8
[10-Jan-2013 04:37:04]  <rollermine> Yui: (1+5)+8=14
[10-Jan-2013 04:37:07]  <IllFlower> alternatively, actually, all of you can just use a passive defense and take no damage, since all of you have defensive attributes above 4...
[10-Jan-2013 04:37:37]  * Yuna takes a passive defense? XD
[10-Jan-2013 04:37:44]  <Sumire> 14I realized that after I rolled; I then realized that even had I rolled a 2, I'd've taken no damage
[10-Jan-2013 04:38:36]  <IllFlower> you also wouldn't take Corruption, so let's just say that you guys all passively defended.
[10-Jan-2013 04:39:06]  <Sumire> 14works for me
[10-Jan-2013 04:39:14]  <IllFlower> the witch backs up and charges at the girls, but overshoots them in its confusion after Sumire's attack.
[10-Jan-2013 04:39:20]  <Yui> (me too)
[10-Jan-2013 04:39:25]  <IllFlower> Yuna's go.
[10-Jan-2013 04:40:13]  * Yuna waves her flashlight around to try to illuminate the enemy and gauge its weaknesses!
[10-Jan-2013 04:40:22]  <Yuna> +roll 2d6+9
[10-Jan-2013 04:40:22]  <rollermine> Yuna: (2+2)+9=13
[10-Jan-2013 04:40:51]  <IllFlower> that's below 14, sorry, so a failure.
[10-Jan-2013 04:40:56]  * Yuna looks closely but can't figure out anything as the witch twirls around violently.
[10-Jan-2013 04:41:11]  <IllFlower> the light just seems to aggravate the tiger-like figure...
[10-Jan-2013 04:41:29]  <IllFlower> okay, next round. anyone want to change their attack/defense/support attributes?
[10-Jan-2013 04:41:43]  <Sumire> I think I'll keep them the same for now
[10-Jan-2013 04:42:19]  <Yui> (same here)
[10-Jan-2013 04:42:42]  <IllFlower> Yuna?
[10-Jan-2013 04:43:32]  <Yuna> I'm going to swap to (A: Mg 6; D: Ht 9; S: Fr 3)
[10-Jan-2013 04:43:35]  <Sumire> 14Since the strain starts at 3, do Yui and I cound as having a relationship?
[10-Jan-2013 04:43:48]  <Yuna> ((I think 3 means no relationship))
[10-Jan-2013 04:43:53]  <IllFlower> no, it's nonfunctional until you remove a point.
[10-Jan-2013 04:44:30]  * Sumire will attack again.
[10-Jan-2013 04:44:48]  <Yuna> (Does initiative stay the same?)
[10-Jan-2013 04:45:04]  <IllFlower> Yuna goes before Yui this time.
[10-Jan-2013 04:45:12]  <IllFlower> Sumire: make your roll.
[10-Jan-2013 04:45:23]  <Sumire> +roll 2d6+8
[10-Jan-2013 04:45:23]  <rollermine> Sumire: (4+2)+8=14
[10-Jan-2013 04:45:49]  <IllFlower> +roll 2d6+4
[10-Jan-2013 04:45:49]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (2+6)+4=12
[10-Jan-2013 04:46:04]  <IllFlower> +roll d6+4
[10-Jan-2013 04:46:04]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 6+4=10
[10-Jan-2013 04:46:09]  <IllFlower> witch takes 10 damage.
[10-Jan-2013 04:47:15]  <IllFlower> Yuna's turn next while Sumire describes the attack.
[10-Jan-2013 04:48:31]  * Yuna , frustrated with her inability to see anything with her flashlight, attacks the witch.
[10-Jan-2013 04:48:36]  <Yuna> +roll 2d6+6
[10-Jan-2013 04:48:37]  <rollermine> Yuna: (4+6)+6=16
[10-Jan-2013 04:48:46]  <Sumire> Once again, Sumire disappears and reappears on the other side of the witch, startling it; Yui or Yuna may have seen the rippling windows in the brief seconds they were in existence, but the tiger would not understand.  She swirled around, shouted the word "SHARD" at a loud volume, and several glass shards emerge and strike the witch.
[10-Jan-2013 04:48:48]  <IllFlower> (I'm not going to prompt you guys to describe what happens from now on, just do so when you feel it's necessary)
[10-Jan-2013 04:49:29]  <IllFlower> the tiger-witch writhes in pain. surreal gushes of paper... blood? spout from its wounds.
[10-Jan-2013 04:50:00]  <IllFlower> Yuna: you rolled a 6, roll another die
[10-Jan-2013 04:50:47]  <IllFlower> that's also a point of Overcharge for now
[10-Jan-2013 04:51:14]  <Yuna> +roll 1d6
[10-Jan-2013 04:51:14]  <rollermine> Yuna: (2)=2
[10-Jan-2013 04:52:34]  <IllFlower> 18, okay.
[10-Jan-2013 04:52:55]  <IllFlower> witch will use one of its Overcharge points and clash.
[10-Jan-2013 04:53:04]  <IllFlower> +roll 3d6+4
[10-Jan-2013 04:53:04]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (4+6+6)+4=20
[10-Jan-2013 04:53:12]  <Yuna> (overcharge takes turns, right?  so after it rolls, I can take more overcharge points if I want, right?)
[10-Jan-2013 04:53:27]  <IllFlower> yes, you can.
[10-Jan-2013 04:53:35]  <IllFlower> however, I just rolled two sixes, so
[10-Jan-2013 04:53:38]  <IllFlower> +roll 2d6
[10-Jan-2013 04:53:39]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (1+5)=6
[10-Jan-2013 04:53:43]  <IllFlower> 26 total.
[10-Jan-2013 04:53:46]  <Yuna> @___@
[10-Jan-2013 04:54:13]  <Sumire> 14D:
[10-Jan-2013 04:54:15]  <IllFlower> you'd have to take at least 2 points of Overcharge to rolla roll above that.
[10-Jan-2013 04:54:22]  <IllFlower> s/rolla//
[10-Jan-2013 04:54:34]  <Sumire> 14and you already took one, so I wouldn't.
[10-Jan-2013 04:54:44]  <Yuna> ((You rolled two sizes, so the witch used up 3 overcharge points, right?)
[10-Jan-2013 04:55:42]  <IllFlower> I'm actually not sure if the extra rolls on a 6 count against the witch's quota. hm...
[10-Jan-2013 04:56:29]  <IllFlower> (witches have a quota of how many Overcharge points they can take, I assume only for voluntary Overcharge additions)
[10-Jan-2013 04:57:09]  <IllFlower> (the manual does say "spend" so I'm inclined to take that interpretation)
[10-Jan-2013 04:57:13]  <Yuna> (I guess, figure out however you want to do that?)
[10-Jan-2013 04:57:25]  <Yuna> (I'm not using overcharge points, roll for damage ;-;)
[10-Jan-2013 04:57:34]  <IllFlower> all right
[10-Jan-2013 04:57:48]  <IllFlower> +roll d6+2+4
[10-Jan-2013 04:57:48]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 3+2+4=9
[10-Jan-2013 04:58:00]  <IllFlower> Yuna takes 9 damage; she's at 9 Resolve.
[10-Jan-2013 04:58:17]  <IllFlower> (don't change the spreadsheet, Resolve resets after every battle)
[10-Jan-2013 04:58:36]  <Sumire> 14will this guy end up on the spreadsheet after the battle?
[10-Jan-2013 04:58:41]  <IllFlower> okay, I've burned my turn by clashing, so Yui goes.
[10-Jan-2013 04:58:50]  <IllFlower> Sumire: yes. that's what the sheet is for, after all ;)
[10-Jan-2013 04:59:19]  * Yuna blasts the witch with her flashlight, causing it to recoil back -- but only momentarily, as it spins around and slams into her, slamming her into the ground.
[10-Jan-2013 05:00:20]  <IllFlower> the tiger flares a particularly violent shade of red. a noticeable wave of heat blows past the girls.
[10-Jan-2013 05:00:58]  <Yui> (Nemo how do I go about Healing Touch on Fiorarararara? Is it time for that?)
[10-Jan-2013 05:01:52]  <IllFlower> Yui: you take a point of Overcharge, then roll d6+2 to find out how much Resolve you restore. this uses your turn.
[10-Jan-2013 05:02:05]  <Yuna> (I have regenerate, so I shouldn't be that bad...?)
[10-Jan-2013 05:02:23]  <IllFlower> you have to pick an attribute to place the Overcharge on if you do so.
[10-Jan-2013 05:02:28]  <Yui> (oh, okay, This is true.)
[10-Jan-2013 05:02:32]  <Yuna> (Though I suppose I wasted the witch's turn XD)
[10-Jan-2013 05:03:20]  * Yui attempts to actually make a hit this time
[10-Jan-2013 05:03:31]  <IllFlower> roll for your attack.
[10-Jan-2013 05:03:43]  <Yui> +2d6+6
[10-Jan-2013 05:03:47]  <Yui> errr
[10-Jan-2013 05:03:56]  <Yui> +roll 2d6+6
[10-Jan-2013 05:03:56]  <rollermine> Yui: (4+5)+6=15
[10-Jan-2013 05:04:08]  *** SpruceZeus is now known as SpruceZeus|away

[10-Jan-2013 05:04:11]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (1+2)+4=7
[10-Jan-2013 05:04:18]  <IllFlower> welp.
[10-Jan-2013 05:04:33]  <Sumire> 14make it super flashy, boo
[10-Jan-2013 05:04:50]  <IllFlower> +roll d6+3
[10-Jan-2013 05:04:50]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 6+3=9
[10-Jan-2013 05:04:57]  <Yuna> (!)
[10-Jan-2013 05:05:08]  <Yuna> (Roll again, right?)
[10-Jan-2013 05:05:19]  <Sumire> 14no, you don't roll again for damage calculations
[10-Jan-2013 05:05:21]  <IllFlower> no, 6 rule doesn't apply to damage rolls.
[10-Jan-2013 05:05:31]  <Yuna> (ahh, okay)
[10-Jan-2013 05:06:57]  <IllFlower> okay, new round. any changes to attributes?
[10-Jan-2013 05:07:24]  <Sumire> keeping things the same
[10-Jan-2013 05:07:35]  <Yuna> I'll keep things the same
[10-Jan-2013 05:08:50]  * Yui glances back at Yuna and turns to face the tiger with a snarl on her face and in her voice. "That was my FRIEND" she says through gritted teeth and grabbing either end of the rolling pin rolls it against her leg sending it spinning between her hands. Shadows dance along the floor and up the tiger. (and keeping things the same)
[10-Jan-2013 05:08:51]  <IllFlower> Yui's attack is successful, but the witch throws up a barricade at the last moment, absorbing some of the damage. the witch looks to be on its last legs, however. its motions are sluggish, and it seems to be disoriented after getting smacked over the head with a rolling pin.
[10-Jan-2013 05:09:08]  <IllFlower> okay, Sumire, your go.
[10-Jan-2013 05:09:29]  <Cultist> 14http://25.media.tumblr.com/2b3ea38abc8a3d3226acc6879e1b5d6b/tumblr_mgc92xNY6b1redb1io1_1280.jpg

[10-Jan-2013 05:09:38]  <Sumire> 14that it was
[10-Jan-2013 05:09:44]  * Sumire will attack again
[10-Jan-2013 05:09:52]  <IllFlower> roll.
[10-Jan-2013 05:09:57]  <Sumire> +roll 2d6+8
[10-Jan-2013 05:09:58]  <rollermine> Sumire: (3+3)+8=14
[10-Jan-2013 05:10:06]  <Yuna> (Nitya XD)
[10-Jan-2013 05:10:58]  <IllFlower> the witch clashes again.
[10-Jan-2013 05:11:12]  <IllFlower> +roll 2d6+5

[10-Jan-2013 05:11:21]  <IllFlower> 26.
[10-Jan-2013 05:11:41]  <Sumire> 14I won't try to overcharge against that.
[10-Jan-2013 05:11:57]  <IllFlower> +roll d6+2+4
[10-Jan-2013 05:11:58]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 6+2+4=12
[10-Jan-2013 05:12:14]  <IllFlower> ... are you *sure*
[10-Jan-2013 05:12:37]  <Cultist> 14of course!
[10-Jan-2013 05:12:39]  <Yuna> (I don't think trying to beat that with overcharge is a good idea... odds are you won't win)
[10-Jan-2013 05:12:45]  <Sumire> @wa (26-14)/3.5
[10-Jan-2013 05:12:46]  <Omnipresence> 14Sumire: Wolfram|Alpha: Input: (26-14)/3.5 — Result: 3.42857 — Repeating decimal: 3.428571^_  (period 6) — Rational approximation: 24/7 = 3 + 3/7
[10-Jan-2013 05:12:55]  <Sumire> 14yes, I'm sure.
[10-Jan-2013 05:13:36]  <Yuna> (That is a lot of 6s @_@)
[10-Jan-2013 05:14:10]  <IllFlower> okay, Sumire attempts to attack the witch. before she can even orient her wand, though, the tiger lashes out with a forepaw, knocking her across the room.
[10-Jan-2013 05:14:23]  <IllFlower> she takes 12 damage, leaving her with 6 Resolve.
[10-Jan-2013 05:14:43]  <IllFlower> (room, cave, same difference.)
[10-Jan-2013 05:14:51]  <IllFlower> Yuna's turn is next.
[10-Jan-2013 05:15:22]  <Sumire> 14I think this time healing touch might actually be necessary, since I can't regenerate ;_;
[10-Jan-2013 05:15:37]  <IllFlower> she gains 1 Resolve, putting her at 10.
[10-Jan-2013 05:16:09]  <IllFlower> I suspect the witch will be dead before it becomes necessary. hint, hint.
[10-Jan-2013 05:16:34]  * Yuna attacks
[10-Jan-2013 05:16:38]  <Yuna> +roll 2d6+6
[10-Jan-2013 05:16:38]  <rollermine> Yuna: (5+4)+6=15
[10-Jan-2013 05:16:45]  <Sumire> 14true.  I assume that I'd get at least another hit, which would probably knock me out of magical form, before I'd die, though, right?
[10-Jan-2013 05:16:46]  <IllFlower> +roll 2d6+4
[10-Jan-2013 05:16:46]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (1+3)+4=8
[10-Jan-2013 05:17:06]  <IllFlower> Sumire: yes, you don't get gibbed for having negative Resolve.
[10-Jan-2013 05:17:14]  <Yui> (let's go Yuna, let's go WOO!)
[10-Jan-2013 05:17:18]  <IllFlower> +roll d6+3
[10-Jan-2013 05:17:18]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 2+3=5
[10-Jan-2013 05:17:27]  <Yuna> Sumireeee!!!  This is for you!
[10-Jan-2013 05:18:14]  <IllFlower> I take it Yuna attacks with her flashlight?
[10-Jan-2013 05:18:24]  * Yuna dives towards the witch and catches it off guard with an attack while it's still paying attention to Sumire.
[10-Jan-2013 05:18:27]  <Yuna> (yes)
[10-Jan-2013 05:19:54]  <IllFlower> Yuna's flashlight seems to blast away the witch with a burst of light. the catlike figure gives off a horrendous caterwauling noise as the beam sweeps it away, before finally vanishing.
[10-Jan-2013 05:20:27]  <Yui> Yuna! You did it!
[10-Jan-2013 05:20:28]  <Sumire> Holy crap, Yuna, that was amazing!
[10-Jan-2013 05:20:52]  <IllFlower> in its place lies a small trinket, black in color, but before anyone can make head or tail of what it is, the origami figures begin to collapse from the walls of the cave.
[10-Jan-2013 05:21:17]  <IllFlower> you should probably take the trinket and run, just saying.
[10-Jan-2013 05:21:33]  <Sumire> So what direction is out of here?
[10-Jan-2013 05:22:27]  <Yuna> I... I did it... 
[10-Jan-2013 05:22:36]  * Yuna stands slightly stunned
[10-Jan-2013 05:22:37]  <Yui> Yes, you did
[10-Jan-2013 05:22:45]  <Yui> now grab the thing and let's MOVE
[10-Jan-2013 05:22:49]  * Sumire runs over to grab the trinket
[10-Jan-2013 05:22:49]  <Yuna> Um... I think we should grab that--yes!
[10-Jan-2013 05:22:51]  <Yuna> We have to get out of here
[10-Jan-2013 05:22:57]  * Sumire then quickly tags after Yui
[10-Jan-2013 05:23:15]  *** Xeniera <~Solstace@67-5-181-27.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness

[10-Jan-2013 05:23:22]  * Yuna dashes after Yui too.
[10-Jan-2013 05:23:45]  <Yui> Man, I'm not sure I ever want to make cranes again after that, Yuna
[10-Jan-2013 05:24:08]  <Yuna> Me too... I don't think I'll be able to see folded paper the same way ever again.
[10-Jan-2013 05:24:12]  <Cultist> 14quick quick end with the shittiest pun imaginable
[10-Jan-2013 05:24:36]  <IllFlower> the girls make it out of the maze just as the last cranes crash behind them.
[10-Jan-2013 05:24:41]  * Yuna pants
[10-Jan-2013 05:24:53]  <Yuna> Sumire... are you okay?  That looked a lot worse than a mere paper cut.
[10-Jan-2013 05:25:08]  <Sumire> Oh my god you two were great and I think I might have actually died without you and I think I want to lie down forever right now actually
[10-Jan-2013 05:25:09]  <IllFlower> a falling origami piece blocks the entrance to the portal, which then vanishes.
[10-Jan-2013 05:25:16]  <Cultist> 14well, they'll have trouble /papering over/ that defeat!!
[10-Jan-2013 05:25:44]  <IllFlower> YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
[10-Jan-2013 05:25:56]  <IllFlower> /sunglasses
[10-Jan-2013 05:25:59]  <Sumire> 14I wonder if the person who folded all those cranes got their wish.
[10-Jan-2013 05:26:16]  <IllFlower> hey, someone picked up on the hint!
[10-Jan-2013 05:26:38]  <IllFlower> +roll 2d6+8
[10-Jan-2013 05:26:38]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (5+1)+8=14
[10-Jan-2013 05:26:38]  <Yuna> ((Maybe they wished to be... lifted to heaven?))
[10-Jan-2013 05:26:41]  <SpruceZeus|away> (it was extremely subtle)
[10-Jan-2013 05:26:43]  *** SpruceZeus|away is now known as SpruceZeus
[10-Jan-2013 05:26:47]  <SpruceZeus> (>_>)
[10-Jan-2013 05:26:59]  <SpruceZeus> (also, i like that it was a literal paper tiger :V)
[10-Jan-2013 05:27:00]  <IllFlower> (well, it didn't matter if anyone figured it out, really.)
[10-Jan-2013 05:27:10]  <Yuna> (daki: oh god I just got that)
[10-Jan-2013 05:27:17]  <TragbarenRechner[empty]> 15«Sumire: yes, you don't get gibbed for having negative Resolve.» DISAPPOINTMENT
[10-Jan-2013 05:27:32]  <IllFlower> (I'd like to say I'm as clever as SpruceZeus' comments would lead you to believe, but no.)
[10-Jan-2013 05:27:33]  <Cultist> 14TragbarenRechner[empty]: I'll be sure to take Bloody Mess.
[10-Jan-2013 05:27:39]  <TragbarenRechner[empty]> 15 :D
[10-Jan-2013 05:27:58]  <IllFlower> anyway, turns out the little trinket you found will remove 14 Corruption.
[10-Jan-2013 05:28:05]  <Yuna> How much do each of us have?
[10-Jan-2013 05:28:34]  <IllFlower> seeing as how the girls have a total of 3 (Sumire) + 2 (Yui) + 4 (Yuna) = 9, why don't we just call it a wash?
[10-Jan-2013 05:28:48]  <IllFlower> unless you really want to hold on to the remaining 5 charges.
[10-Jan-2013 05:28:52]  <Yuna> (That sounds like a good idea? XD)
[10-Jan-2013 05:29:20]  <Sumire> 14Okay.
[10-Jan-2013 05:29:46]  <Yui> (fine by me)
[10-Jan-2013 05:29:48]  * Yuna touches her soul gem to the trinket, clearing it up.
[10-Jan-2013 05:30:00]  <Yuna> Huh, it looks like it still has some power left.  Yui, you want to keep it around?
[10-Jan-2013 05:30:05]  * Sumire does likewise
[10-Jan-2013 05:30:09]  <TragbarenRechner[empty]> 15I assume Cubic explained to them how the trinkets work?
[10-Jan-2013 05:30:17]  <IllFlower> the girls should probably do something about the random stranger lying in the street, by the way.
[10-Jan-2013 05:30:54]  <IllFlower> the witch's influence is gone, but taking a spill on the pavement like that couldn't have been good for him.

[10-Jan-2013 05:31:18]  * Yuna takes a moment to finish catching her breath.  "Ah... that's... that... that went pretty well, I guess?"
[10-Jan-2013 05:31:35]  <Yui> I don't think keeping it around is too terrible an id--I'd forgotten about him
[10-Jan-2013 05:31:46]  <Cultist> 13TragbarenRechner[empty]: jesus
[10-Jan-2013 05:31:51]  <Cultist> 12colors are hard.
[10-Jan-2013 05:31:58]  <Sumire> 14fourteen, cultist
[10-Jan-2013 05:32:07]  <Yui> Yuna, should we take 'im to the hospital?
[10-Jan-2013 05:32:19]  <IllFlower> if one of you wants to keep the Despair Trinket, note it on the spreadsheet with a "-5" or somesuch.
[10-Jan-2013 05:32:22]  <Sumire> That would probably be a good idea.
[10-Jan-2013 05:32:24]  <Cultist> 11bite me, you psychomagical bitch
[10-Jan-2013 05:32:48]  <Sumire> Might want to change out of these outfits first though. 14are we even still transformed
[10-Jan-2013 05:33:01]  <TragbarenRechner[empty]> 15I've been pretty much giggling nonstop for the last hour, between that thread and this and etc. but I should sleep. good luck not getting blindsided by another witch in the last fifteen minutes, you all! also, colour 15, nityer.
[10-Jan-2013 05:33:09]  <Yuna> (Goodnight, Barcode!)
[10-Jan-2013 05:33:11]  <Cultist> 1414.

[10-Jan-2013 05:33:19]  <IllFlower> poof! the magical girl outfits vanish as Sumire voices the thought.
[10-Jan-2013 05:33:31]  <Yui> I guess that takes care of that!
[10-Jan-2013 05:33:38]  * Yuna walks back over to the shipping man
[10-Jan-2013 05:33:49]  <Yuna> Jeez, he still looks really out of it.  Do you think we'd need to carry him?
[10-Jan-2013 05:34:13]  <Sumire> I think we might be able to pick him up if we all worked together...  That, or try to wake him up.
[10-Jan-2013 05:34:48]  <Yui> do you think he had anything like a platform with wheels in his truck?
[10-Jan-2013 05:35:10]  <IllFlower> you guys could call for an ambulance...
[10-Jan-2013 05:35:16]  <Yuna> (Oh, good point.)
[10-Jan-2013 05:35:23]  <Sumire> Maybe, but I don't think I'd want to go near that truck again.
[10-Jan-2013 05:35:26]  <Yuna> Maybe we should just call 911?
[10-Jan-2013 05:35:32]  <IllFlower> just saying, it's 2013. I'm sure you guys have at least one phone. each.
[10-Jan-2013 05:35:32]  <Sumire> Sure.
[10-Jan-2013 05:35:36]  * Sumire pulls out her phone
[10-Jan-2013 05:35:42]  <Yui> That sounds like a plan to me
[10-Jan-2013 05:36:37]  <Sumire> Hello, 911?  I was with my friends and we found a man just lying on the ground.  Could you send an ambulance to the shopping district, at... Yuna, do you know our address?
[10-Jan-2013 05:36:53]  <IllFlower> (but it's 119! D:)
[10-Jan-2013 05:36:59]  <IllFlower> ("who cares")
[10-Jan-2013 05:37:03]  <Cultist> 14being japan is suffering
[10-Jan-2013 05:37:06]  <Sumire> 14pretend I said that then.
[10-Jan-2013 05:37:18]  <Cultist> 14"basically the same number anyway"
[10-Jan-2013 05:37:33]  <SpruceZeus> well you know, names in japan are backwards
[10-Jan-2013 05:37:43]  <SpruceZeus> so really, it's just translating it to western conventions :V
[10-Jan-2013 05:37:45]  <IllFlower> the dispatchers, fortunately, seem to know which shopping district you're talking about, and send over an ambulance.
[10-Jan-2013 05:37:55]  <Sumire> 14alternatively, names in AMERICA are backwards
[10-Jan-2013 05:37:56]  <Yuna> I think we should get away before the ambulence arrives...
[10-Jan-2013 05:38:04]  <Sumire> Probably a good plan.
[10-Jan-2013 05:38:08]  <Yuna> I don't think I want to be questioned about why we were out here in the middle of the night.
[10-Jan-2013 05:38:26]  <IllFlower> the nice thing about the streets being deserted is that the ambulance gets there rather quickly, but not quickly enough to find the girls.
[10-Jan-2013 05:38:26]  <Yui> that could end badly
[10-Jan-2013 05:38:51]  <IllFlower> "well, that's odd," the EMTs remark when they find nobody there.
[10-Jan-2013 05:39:22]  <IllFlower> well, in any case, I think this episode is about over, but before that, it's time to assign experience points!
[10-Jan-2013 05:39:26]  <Yuna> dun dun duuuuun
[10-Jan-2013 05:39:32]  <Cultist> 14fucking prank call delinquent bitches
[10-Jan-2013 05:39:42]  <SpruceZeus> *victory fanfare*
[10-Jan-2013 05:39:58]  <IllFlower> note in particular the one where each player gets to award 1 XP to one other player however they wish. if the three of you could do so now...
[10-Jan-2013 05:40:11]  <Yuna> we get 1 for playing, 1 for beating the witch, right?
[10-Jan-2013 05:40:15]  <Cultist> 14the victory fanfare is actually composed entirely out of samples of 911 calls (to continue IllFlower's music tastes)
[10-Jan-2013 05:41:01]  <IllFlower> yes, and Yui gets 1 each for successfully rolling to form a new relationship.

[10-Jan-2013 05:41:44]  <Sumire> I give one to Yuna for saving me
[10-Jan-2013 05:42:08]  <IllFlower> also, for clerical (and possibly plot) purposes, one of you will have to take the Despair Trinket with you
[10-Jan-2013 05:42:12]  <Yui> 1 to Sumire for landing first hit
