[27-Jan-2013 20:12:43]  <IllFlower> and we're off.
[27-Jan-2013 20:13:49]  <IllFlower> Sunday evening. Yuna's gathered the other initiates in the park. Aoi excepted; it looks like he's gone off somewhere with his girlfriend. (of all the days, right?)
[27-Jan-2013 20:13:49]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((I keep forgetting illflower's typing affords me plenty of time to simultaneously do stats homework))
[27-Jan-2013 20:14:10]  <Yuna> ((ack, I hope they feel better too))
[27-Jan-2013 20:14:24]  <Sumire> "So what's the plan from here?"
[27-Jan-2013 20:14:35]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((she's told us everything, right?))
[27-Jan-2013 20:14:43]  <IllFlower> Yuna's voice is tired, likely from having gotten virtually zero sleep, but explains what she learned from visiting Haruka the previous night.
[27-Jan-2013 20:14:49]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((oh.))
[27-Jan-2013 20:15:00]  <buttercupistiny> ((remember the **))
[27-Jan-2013 20:15:02]  <IllFlower> chatter. go. **
[27-Jan-2013 20:15:04]  <Sumire> 14I have yet to read the logs; what did she learn?
[27-Jan-2013 20:15:04]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((mhm))
[27-Jan-2013 20:15:25]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((sumire - oh boy. well, ctrl-f "feed"))
[27-Jan-2013 20:15:54]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] shows extreme consternation. "So...she's been behind these killings...?"
[27-Jan-2013 20:16:17]  <Yuna> I... I can't think of anything else that makes sense..
[27-Jan-2013 20:16:17]  <IllFlower> Sumire: in brief: Kei is responsible for Namie and Tadashi's deaths. she's also a magical girl.
[27-Jan-2013 20:18:33]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "I just don't know what to think. She's not a witch, but she's murdered our classmates...what should we do?" Miaka glances aside, almost muttering. "If we have to fight her...what then?"
[27-Jan-2013 20:19:23]  <Sumire> «It'd be nice if we could just take her down nonlethally and give her to the justice system, but somehow I don't think we'd be able to get a conviction for "magical murder"...»
[27-Jan-2013 20:21:09]  <Yuna> Y-yeah... on the one hand it feels like vigilante justice is just doing the same thing she is... but... I don't feel like we have much of a choice...
[27-Jan-2013 20:21:51]  <Yui> I'm with you on that, Yuna. It's not a very comfortable place to be, but it's not like the proper authorities can handle this one.
[27-Jan-2013 20:22:21]  <Sumire> "Of course, this is all moot if we don't know how to actually find this Kei person..."
[27-Jan-2013 20:22:32]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] nods. "If we save her...will she still be able to fight witches? Is that even fair? I mean, I didn't exactly come here with plans for a magical judicial system..."
[27-Jan-2013 20:22:37]  <Yuna> "Maybe if we knew who her next victim might be...?"
[27-Jan-2013 20:22:42]  <IllFlower> everyone roll a Sharp challenge. 2d6+Sh.
[27-Jan-2013 20:22:43]  <Yuna> "I wonder if the fluffball could help."
[27-Jan-2013 20:22:49]  <Yuna> +roll 2d6+7
[27-Jan-2013 20:22:50]  <rollermine> Yuna: (1+3)+7=11
[27-Jan-2013 20:22:53]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((rummaging for charsheets))

[27-Jan-2013 20:22:56]  <rollermine> Sumire: (1+2)+6=9

[27-Jan-2013 20:23:18]  <rollermine> buttercupistiny: (6+6)+6=18
[27-Jan-2013 20:23:24]  <IllFlower> nice job.
[27-Jan-2013 20:23:25]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((nice))
[27-Jan-2013 20:23:28]  <Yuna> ((buttercup is a genius))
[27-Jan-2013 20:23:32]  <Yuna> ((but we already knew that))
[27-Jan-2013 20:23:37]  <Sumire> 14Yui is the only one who is actually thinking right now
[27-Jan-2013 20:23:39]  <IllFlower> all the rest of you, dismal. just dismal!
[27-Jan-2013 20:24:08]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((as far as the plot is concerned, miaka wouldn't be aware of anything short of a mine going off beside her.
[27-Jan-2013 20:24:09]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ))
[27-Jan-2013 20:24:31]  <IllFlower> Yui suddenly feels a sensation of... well, it's hard to explain. magnetism? like something's pulling her somewhere...
[27-Jan-2013 20:24:34]  <Sumire> 14the nuclear bom went off like a bom
[27-Jan-2013 20:25:17]  <Sumire> 14fucking magical magnets, how do they work
[27-Jan-2013 20:26:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((calm like a bom!))
[27-Jan-2013 20:26:56]  <Yui> Well, um, guys I think we should head this way, I've got this strange feeling and well, gut feelings haven't let me down yet.
[27-Jan-2013 20:27:14]  <Sumire> "I don't think anyone else has a better idea, so let's follow Yui!"
[27-Jan-2013 20:27:26]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] shrugs, follows. Looking a bit lost in thought.
[27-Jan-2013 20:27:44]  <Yui> ((follow Yui is the worst plan. She will lead you to your doom))
[27-Jan-2013 20:27:57]  <Yuna> "Okay Yui, following you sounds good!"
[27-Jan-2013 20:28:01]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((lol))
[27-Jan-2013 20:28:03]  * Yuna tags along closely
[27-Jan-2013 20:28:23]  <IllFlower> Yui heads out of the park, somewhere towards the river that runs through the suburbs, and the other girls follow suit, lacking for any other idea of how to find Kei.
[27-Jan-2013 20:29:30]  <IllFlower> she stops at a pedestrian overpass over an intersection a few blocks away. traffic lights blink slowly over the empty roads.
[27-Jan-2013 20:29:42]  <IllFlower> everyone but Yui, roll another Sh challenge...
[27-Jan-2013 20:29:52]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> +roll 2d6+6
[27-Jan-2013 20:29:52]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: (2+6)+6=14
[27-Jan-2013 20:29:53]  <Sumire> +roll 2d6+6
[27-Jan-2013 20:29:53]  <rollermine> Sumire: (2+2)+6=10
[27-Jan-2013 20:29:53]  <Yui> ((if you guys fail so help me))
[27-Jan-2013 20:29:54]  <Yuna> ((illflower you absolutely love the "traffic lights and empty roads" images don't you))
[27-Jan-2013 20:30:06]  <Yuna> +roll 2d6+6  
[27-Jan-2013 20:30:06]  <rollermine> Yuna: (5+4)+6=15
[27-Jan-2013 20:30:13]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((dammit!))
[27-Jan-2013 20:30:19]  <Sumire> 14sumire must be thinking about something other than kei
[27-Jan-2013 20:30:53]  <IllFlower> Miaka and Yuna start feeling compelled in a certain direction as well, and they mention as much to Yui and Sumire.
[27-Jan-2013 20:31:11]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((same one?))
[27-Jan-2013 20:31:19]  <Yui> ((LET'S FOLLOW OUR MAGICAL GUTS INTO OBLIVION))
[27-Jan-2013 20:31:32]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "Hhhey....uh...I don't know how to explain this, but I've got this feeling we reeeally should be going this way."
[27-Jan-2013 20:31:36]  <Sumire> 14Sumire is so going to get ambushed. ;_;
[27-Jan-2013 20:31:46]  <Yuna> ((bonus points if we felt like going different ways))
[27-Jan-2013 20:32:09]  <IllFlower> Yui asks the two of them where the sensation is coming from. Yuna points down the road. Miaka points in the same... general direction, but off into the trees by the roadside a bit...
[27-Jan-2013 20:32:26]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((looks like miaka wants to have a Roadside Picnic! a a aaa))
[27-Jan-2013 20:32:38]  <Yuna> ((*slaps barcode*))
[27-Jan-2013 20:32:45]  <IllFlower> Yui gives Miaka an odd look, something like "are you sure...?" **
[27-Jan-2013 20:32:46]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> (( >u<
[27-Jan-2013 20:32:47]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ))
[27-Jan-2013 20:32:58]  <Yuna> ((and yes I get the reference XD))
[27-Jan-2013 20:33:13]  <Yuna> ((oh god, now I'm imagining a magical girls/roadside picnic corssover))
[27-Jan-2013 20:33:18]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] shrugs in a way that somehow communicates "yes but I don't know why."
[27-Jan-2013 20:33:26]  <Yuna> ((where witches and stuff are bizarre alien technology))
[27-Jan-2013 20:33:54]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((red alert 3 had the neo-imperial army have magical girls, but it...wasn't exactly a serious game))
[27-Jan-2013 20:34:06]  <Yuna> what, it did? XD
[27-Jan-2013 20:34:16]  <Nitya> 14yeah, that game is silly as hell everything-wise
[27-Jan-2013 20:34:20]  <Nitya> 14superpsychic whatevers
[27-Jan-2013 20:34:23]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((yeah. the expansion pack even has a whole campaign where you play as one and it's apparently more serious and stuff))
[27-Jan-2013 20:34:23]  <Sumire> 14yeah, the super unit for Japan was a psychic magical girl
[27-Jan-2013 20:34:30]  <Yui> ((some day Miaka will be the sharpest tool in the shed))
[27-Jan-2013 20:34:32]  <Sumire> 14also they were lead by George Takei
[27-Jan-2013 20:34:39]  <IllFlower> either way, the girls set off down the road where Yui and Yuna feel drawn.
[27-Jan-2013 20:35:05]  <SpruceZeus> ((i might actually have to play that game eventually, if only for George Takei...))
[27-Jan-2013 20:35:14]  <IllFlower> after some distance, it curves around the stand of trees to the side where Miaka pointed, eventually arriving at another intersection.
[27-Jan-2013 20:35:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((yui: :( ))
[27-Jan-2013 20:35:24]  <Sumire> 14it also has Tim Curry and the guy who played Cave Johnson whose name I can't remember
[27-Jan-2013 20:35:45]  <SpruceZeus> ((omfg))
[27-Jan-2013 20:35:48]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((spruce - generally worth you time, as far as camp goes))
[27-Jan-2013 20:35:59]  <IllFlower> it looks like, in a way, Miaka was right. she just had as-the-crow-flies directions...
[27-Jan-2013 20:36:31]  <Sumire> "Do you guys feel Kei anywhere?  I still don't know what you guys are talking about..."
[27-Jan-2013 20:36:51]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((starz))
[27-Jan-2013 20:37:07]  <IllFlower> anyway, this crossing's at just about the absolute edge of town, and aside from a very-much closed gas station and a what looks to be an abandoned auto repair garage across from it, there's nothing here.
[27-Jan-2013 20:37:58]  <IllFlower> the sensation that someone's here changes from a strong pull of "in this direction" to "... somewhere within sight of here..." **
[27-Jan-2013 20:38:15]  <Sumire> 14sharp check?
[27-Jan-2013 20:38:20]  <IllFlower> no, none.
[27-Jan-2013 20:38:21]  * Yui reaches for Yuna's hand, slightly creepy is less so with familiarity involved. 
[27-Jan-2013 20:38:53]  * Yuna holds Yui's hand tightly, somewhere in between clinging out of her own fear and holding it to comfort Yui
[27-Jan-2013 20:39:14]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] looks around. "Well. It certainly /looks/ the part of a hideout..."
[27-Jan-2013 20:39:33]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((should we transform and roll out))
[27-Jan-2013 20:39:33]  <Sumire> 14brb bathroom
[27-Jan-2013 20:39:44]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: up to you guys.
[27-Jan-2013 20:39:52]  <Yui> ((he didn't step on me or fall over the wheelchair!))
[27-Jan-2013 20:39:57]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((lol))
[27-Jan-2013 20:40:36]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "Iunno about you guys, but this place is plenty dangerous-looking even without a magical girl..." Miaka puts her right hand to her chest and transforms.
[27-Jan-2013 20:41:11]  <Yui> Yui nods, and likewise transforms.
[27-Jan-2013 20:41:20]  <Sumire> 14back
[27-Jan-2013 20:41:22]  <Yui> better to do it before we're neck deep
[27-Jan-2013 20:41:30]  <IllFlower> (in case I wasn't explicit enough, it's your turn to poke around here a bit.)
[27-Jan-2013 20:41:32]  <Sumire> "Yeah, this is a good idea.  TRANSFORM!"
[27-Jan-2013 20:41:55]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((grove washington junior - knucklehead --> makes me think that I should play this like a buddy-cop bust scene))
[27-Jan-2013 20:42:25]  <Yui> so, gas station or garage first?
[27-Jan-2013 20:42:34]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] supports the Kruger with her other hand and looks around. "Garage looks closer. Follow me."
[27-Jan-2013 20:42:37]  <IllFlower> the swirl of bright colors converging on this empty intersection might be enough to make someone think a UFO's landing here, if anyone were paying attention. **
[27-Jan-2013 20:42:48]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((you told us we had to look around >:I))
[27-Jan-2013 20:43:04]  * Yuna isn't sure about transforming yet, but joins in to be consistent.
[27-Jan-2013 20:43:07]  <Sumire> "Yeah.  Also, I think the garage might give us more room to maneuver and less to get ambushed."
[27-Jan-2013 20:43:39]  <Yui> ((should somebody like, look up or something?))
[27-Jan-2013 20:44:04]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] weighs the tactical options, reaches the garage. She seems fixated, checking behind her at the gas station as she steadily looks at possible entrances. ((you guys do it if you want))
[27-Jan-2013 20:44:44]  <IllFlower> the building looks to be mostly constructed of concrete. a faded sign across the front reads "Murano Auto Shop".
[27-Jan-2013 20:45:23]  <IllFlower> the garage doors are securely closed. it doesn't look like there are any lights on inside.
[27-Jan-2013 20:45:54]  <IllFlower> off to the side is a small addition, probably where the owners of the repair shop had offices and waiting areas.
[27-Jan-2013 20:46:12]  <IllFlower> there's a smaller door there as well.
[27-Jan-2013 20:46:13]  <IllFlower> **
[27-Jan-2013 20:46:16]  <Sumire> "Is there even a way in, Miaka?"
[27-Jan-2013 20:46:58]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "Lots of locked doors. I'm not so sure we need to break-and-enter just yet...why don't we check the gas station?"
[27-Jan-2013 20:47:14]  <Sumire> "Alright.  I'll head over there."  Sumire walks towards the gas station.
[27-Jan-2013 20:47:18]  <IllFlower> I never said the doors were *locked*...
[27-Jan-2013 20:47:25]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((welp))
[27-Jan-2013 20:47:30]  <Yuna> "Maybe we should at least try jiggling them..."
[27-Jan-2013 20:47:36]  <Yuna> "Maybe someone left one of them open?"
[27-Jan-2013 20:48:36]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] glances at Sumire, back at the addition's entrance. She raises the Kruger up and lines up beside the addition's door, on the lock-side of the door. She tries to turn the handle...
[27-Jan-2013 20:48:54]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> raises the Kruger up on one hand and lines*
[27-Jan-2013 20:49:50]  <IllFlower> the door's slightly ajar already, and opens easily onto a waiting room. the chairs in here don't seem to have been touched for some time.
[27-Jan-2013 20:50:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "Sumire! Over here, this place is open!"
[27-Jan-2013 20:50:08]  <IllFlower> there are entrances to what look like back offices between the garage and here off to one side.
[27-Jan-2013 20:50:14]  <Sumire> "Alright.  Let's see what's inside."
[27-Jan-2013 20:50:22]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((sorry about runnin' over you there >_<))
[27-Jan-2013 20:51:01]  <IllFlower> there are a fair few desks. papers strewn across them as well a few on the floor. filing cabinets. service manuals for old cars. **
[27-Jan-2013 20:52:23]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "Well...there are four of us, so...how about two people stand by the entrance, and someone goes in here with me?" Miaka has been perhaps watching too many tactical-police movies.
[27-Jan-2013 20:52:49]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((and not enough to notice rainbows overhead.))
[27-Jan-2013 20:53:18]  <Sumire> "I'll join you, Miaka."
[27-Jan-2013 20:53:39]  <Yui> That leaves us on guard duty, Yuna
[27-Jan-2013 20:54:42]  <Yuna> ((Rainbows overhead?))
[27-Jan-2013 20:54:47]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((the swirling colours))
[27-Jan-2013 20:54:55]  <Yui> ((Illflower's UFO comment))
[27-Jan-2013 20:54:56]  <Yuna> ((I thought illflower was just making a joke about transformation sequences))
[27-Jan-2013 20:54:58]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] puts the Kruger on her back, unable to really enter a building too conveniently with it.  She cautiously enters the building, checking corners as she goes.
[27-Jan-2013 20:55:00]  <IllFlower> Miaka and Sumire head further into the building. at the end of a short hallway is a large door labeled "GARAGE". there are a few pairs of shoes sitting beside it. **
[27-Jan-2013 20:55:12]  <IllFlower> yeah, it was just the transformation thing...
[27-Jan-2013 20:55:15]  * Yuna nods and waits at the front with Yui.
[27-Jan-2013 20:55:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((oh. oops))
[27-Jan-2013 20:55:35]  <Sumire> "Well, I think we found our magical girl.  I can't see very many mechanics or ordinary homeless with that many pairs of shoes..."
[27-Jan-2013 20:56:20]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] looks, eyebrows raised. She then tries to open the door.
[27-Jan-2013 20:56:33]  <Yui> ((Nemo are we close enough to hear that))
[27-Jan-2013 20:56:40]  <IllFlower> they're work boots, Sumire. just so you know. ;)
[27-Jan-2013 20:57:11]  <Sumire> 14 >:|
[27-Jan-2013 20:57:27]  *** GMH <~glenn@pool-173-66-55-173.washdc.fios.verizon.net> has joined #madokamadness
[27-Jan-2013 20:57:28]  <BGTB2005> 14maybe they're stylish work boots?
[27-Jan-2013 20:57:37]  <Sumire> 14Sumire obviously got a terrible Sh roll again and thought they were fashionable boots
[27-Jan-2013 20:58:31]  <IllFlower> presumably one of you should open the door...
[27-Jan-2013 20:58:36]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((I tried!))
[27-Jan-2013 20:58:38]  <IllFlower> oh, never mind, Miaka did.
[27-Jan-2013 20:59:07]  <IllFlower> the door is unlocked, and seems again to open all too easily.
[27-Jan-2013 20:59:23]  <Sumire> "Do you think we should call Yui and Yuna in?"
[27-Jan-2013 20:59:56]  <IllFlower> the first thing that draws Miaka's attention is the positive mess of stuff on the ground.
[27-Jan-2013 21:00:09]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((answering after the stars))
[27-Jan-2013 21:00:34]  <IllFlower> blankets. photographs. a half-eaten slice of cake, topped with strawberries, in a box.
[27-Jan-2013 21:01:33]  <IllFlower> further beyond, one of the platforms for elevating cars is raised up above everyone's heads. there's nothing on there, though.
[27-Jan-2013 21:01:40]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((oh, good, I hvae a Depressing playlist))
[27-Jan-2013 21:02:17]  <IllFlower> the walls, though, make Miaka do a double take. aside from the bulletin boards pinned with reminders, and random shelves of tools, there are words. everywhere.
[27-Jan-2013 21:02:41]  <IllFlower> they look like they've been haphazardly painted on the walls, dark strokes on the gray surface.
[27-Jan-2013 21:03:00]  <IllFlower> "what should I do?"
[27-Jan-2013 21:03:04]  <IllFlower> "what have I done?"
[27-Jan-2013 21:03:09]  <IllFlower> "nowhere... nowhere..."

[27-Jan-2013 21:04:22]  <Yuna> ((I'm sitll outside, right? ;-;))
[27-Jan-2013 21:04:41]  <Sumire> 14I think we're going to call you in

[27-Jan-2013 21:04:48]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((one second))
[27-Jan-2013 21:05:25]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] looks, stunned. Her previous tenseness has been replaced with shock and gloom. Suddenly she remembers Sumire's question. "y...yeah. forgot we can probably just blast our way out of here if we need to..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:06:01]  <Sumire> "Alright.  YUI, YUNA, WE FOUND SOMETHING!"
[27-Jan-2013 21:06:22]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] stares through the doorway a little.
[27-Jan-2013 21:06:41]  <Yui> Hey Yuna, did you hear that?
[27-Jan-2013 21:06:49]  <Yuna> Y-yeah... I think this is important...!
[27-Jan-2013 21:07:06]  <Yui> Flashlight out and rolling pin ready?
[27-Jan-2013 21:07:10]  <Yuna> Yup!
[27-Jan-2013 21:07:13]  * Yuna tugs on Yui's hand and nervously but excitedly moves to run in
[27-Jan-2013 21:07:36]  * Yui follows eagerly along
[27-Jan-2013 21:08:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "You guys should probably look before we go in..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:08:52]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] turns away, absentmindedly looking towards their entrance in half-aware guard.
[27-Jan-2013 21:08:58]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> their original entrance*
[27-Jan-2013 21:09:06]  * Yuna looks around, her face slowly changing expression as she sees the walls
[27-Jan-2013 21:09:39]  * Sumire stares, her mouth unconsciously opening.  "oh my god...."
[27-Jan-2013 21:09:43]  <IllFlower> the girls step into the garage. so far, there are still no signs of life, but the towers of blankets could be hiding anything... **
[27-Jan-2013 21:10:10]  * Yuna starts to sob a bit as her eyes go back and forth around the room
[27-Jan-2013 21:10:49]  <IllFlower> Yuna: Cool challenge. 2d6+Co.
[27-Jan-2013 21:11:03]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] walks in behind the others. She's starting to firm up again, though any previous internal conflict has visibly worsened. She eyes the blankets.

[27-Jan-2013 21:12:28]  <IllFlower> okay, Yuna's shaken, but calm.
[27-Jan-2013 21:12:39]  <Yuna> ((Actually, Yuna is frozen solid.))
[27-Jan-2013 21:12:49]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: might want to ask for some flashlight assist...
[27-Jan-2013 21:12:56]  * Yui reaches out for Yuna's hand
[27-Jan-2013 21:13:17]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "Maybe something's under these blankets... Yuna, could you point the flashlight my way" Miaka unholsters the Kruger, slowly reaches forward to remove a blanket once the light's on her.
[27-Jan-2013 21:13:24]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> to flip over a*
[27-Jan-2013 21:13:25]  * Yuna pulls her flashlight out of her purse, then reaches out her other hand to meet Yui's.
[27-Jan-2013 21:13:39]  <Yuna> ((oh wait, I'm transformed.  transformed magical girls don't have purses.  I think.  okay rewrite that with whatever makes sense))
[27-Jan-2013 21:14:06]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((you summon the flashlight! gonna probably say that for the kruger if I ever return to this rp. less cumbersome))
[27-Jan-2013 21:14:09]  <Yui> ((yuna pulls the flashlight from between her boobs))

[27-Jan-2013 21:14:16]  <Yuna> ((YUIIII))
[27-Jan-2013 21:14:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> reaches forward using the barrel of the Kruger to flip over a*
[27-Jan-2013 21:14:46]  * Yuna points the flashlight towards Miaka while squeeing Yui's hand.
[27-Jan-2013 21:14:57]  <IllFlower> Yuna shines her flashlight across the room, catching nothing interesting until...
[27-Jan-2013 21:15:10]  <Sumire> 14.............a ghost!
[27-Jan-2013 21:15:43]  <Yuna> *SQUEEZING
[27-Jan-2013 21:15:59]  <Sumire> 14you're squeeing at the yuri potential
[27-Jan-2013 21:16:08]  <IllFlower> in a far corner of the garage, underneath a sheet entirely inadequate for the December chill, lies the figure of an unconscious girl.
[27-Jan-2013 21:16:39]  <Yuna> ((poni, you're projecting))
[27-Jan-2013 21:16:50]  <IllFlower> long, dark hair is almost positively scattered across her face and the floor below.
[27-Jan-2013 21:16:55]  <Sumire> 14hey, I'm not the one who squees over yuri.  That's aondeug
[27-Jan-2013 21:17:11]  <Yuna> ((Does Kei have long hair?))
[27-Jan-2013 21:17:19]  <Yuna> ((We'd know, right?  since she's in the school))
[27-Jan-2013 21:17:38]  <IllFlower> her body is thin, looking like it's just survived being dragged from the next city over.
[27-Jan-2013 21:17:59]  <Yui> ((Nemo's goal: DESTROY US ALL))
[27-Jan-2013 21:18:12]  <IllFlower> her face is gaunt, but it clearly belongs to Kei Shinagawa. **
[27-Jan-2013 21:18:33]  <Sumire> "Oh god, she looks really bad.  I actually feel bad for her, even if she did kill all these people."
[27-Jan-2013 21:18:33]  <Yuna> T-that's... that's... Kei...?  She looks really unwell...
[27-Jan-2013 21:18:38]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] looks up
[27-Jan-2013 21:19:11]  * Yui squeezes Yuna's hand "I can't say I was expecting this"
[27-Jan-2013 21:19:12]  <Yuna> It's... it's hard to believe she could be a magical girl...
[27-Jan-2013 21:19:23]  <Yuna> ... or that she could have even done those things...
[27-Jan-2013 21:19:59]  <Yuna> Part of me just wants to put her in a good bed and prper food...
[27-Jan-2013 21:20:20]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] turns, bringing the Kruger to bear, but immediately lowers it.
[27-Jan-2013 21:20:24]  <Nitya> 14but instead lets get to murderin
[27-Jan-2013 21:20:38]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "...That's her, huh..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:20:44]  <IllFlower> a quiet, tenuous voice reaches Miaka's ears. "don't come near... me..." **
[27-Jan-2013 21:20:45]  <Sumire> 14aoi would shoot first ask questions later
[27-Jan-2013 21:20:59]  <BGTB2005> 14does anyone have a duck?
[27-Jan-2013 21:21:25]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] looks at the others, looks back at Kei. "We...well, we need to do /something/..." she whispers.
[27-Jan-2013 21:22:14]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "Kei...wh...how long have you been here...?" Miaka offers, holding her position.
[27-Jan-2013 21:22:21]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> offers quietly*
[27-Jan-2013 21:23:04]  <IllFlower> "don't come near me!" Kei says, more strongly this time, though her volume is still barely above a whisper.
[27-Jan-2013 21:23:31]  <Yuna> "Kei... you look terrible... what happened to you?"
[27-Jan-2013 21:24:17]  <IllFlower> "I shouldn't be here. I don't belong here. I don't belong here, I don't belong here..." **
[27-Jan-2013 21:24:41]  <Sumire> 14she's a creep, she's a weirdo, what is she doing here, she doesn't belong here
[27-Jan-2013 21:24:49]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> (( :[ ))
[27-Jan-2013 21:25:01]  <Yui> Maybe she didn't mean to hurt all those people, maybe the attraction isn't her fault. But once they're within proximity, things turn ugly?
[27-Jan-2013 21:25:19]  <SpruceZeus> ((pffffft, lol@ponicalica))
[27-Jan-2013 21:26:27]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] glances behind her for manuevering room, but at the moment she's more shaky than at all prepared.
[27-Jan-2013 21:27:23]  <Sumire> "Don't worry, Miaka.  We're here."
[27-Jan-2013 21:27:33]  * Sumire holds Miaka's hand, the one not occupied by Kruger
[27-Jan-2013 21:27:40]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((heh))
[27-Jan-2013 21:27:56]  <IllFlower> Kei slowly pushes herself out from underneath the covers. she's wearing nothing more than a poorly-fitting T-shirt and what might have been jeans at one point.
[27-Jan-2013 21:28:21]  <IllFlower> her breathing is ragged. she slumps against a nearby wall for support, standing slightly askew.
[27-Jan-2013 21:28:35]  <IllFlower> "why... why...?" **
[27-Jan-2013 21:30:02]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] is receptive, clasps a bit strongly as Kei rises. She swallows.
[27-Jan-2013 21:31:22]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] whispers to Sumire. "I...I know she's done these horrible things, but I can't help but feel like we should help her. Is this...wrong...?"
[27-Jan-2013 21:31:46]  <Sumire> "I don't know.  I feel the same way.  I wish there were a way to help her, make her no longer dangerous."
[27-Jan-2013 21:31:55]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((metal (idoliside mix) --> thanks, itunes))
[27-Jan-2013 21:33:04]  <IllFlower> "no... no..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:33:25]  <IllFlower> Kei's eyes go wide as she looks at Miaka, and she roughly collapses to her knees.
[27-Jan-2013 21:33:48]  <IllFlower> "there's no help... for me now..." **
[27-Jan-2013 21:34:45]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] makes up her mind, approaches slowly. "Kei...people...I think...people can always...atone."
[27-Jan-2013 21:35:57]  <IllFlower> Yuna's flashlight catches Kei on and off, making Kei's shadow look as if it's flickering against the back wall of the garage.
[27-Jan-2013 21:36:32]  <IllFlower> "no. no. I killed them..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:36:58]  <Yuna> ((she needs grief seeds))
[27-Jan-2013 21:37:29]  <Sumire> 14yeah, I told Shannon "she's probably going to witchify"
[27-Jan-2013 21:37:40]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((damn lack a stars))
[27-Jan-2013 21:37:48]  <IllFlower> a moment of quiet passes, before Kei's voice rises to a hysteric scream. "Namie -- Tadashi -- they were my friends! I *killed* them! I -- I lo -- and I kil --" **
[27-Jan-2013 21:38:17]  <Sumire> "Calm down, Kei.  Everyone makes mistakes.  I'm sure there's a way for you to atone, to become normal again..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:39:06]  <IllFlower> "no. no. no. no. no... it's already too late..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:39:59]  <IllFlower> Kei reaches behind her. a metallic clinking sound echoes through the room, and when she pulls her hand in front of herself again, there are needles glistening in her hand. (wait, more)
[27-Jan-2013 21:41:06]  <BGTB2005> 14this gon get ugly
[27-Jan-2013 21:41:27]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((man I had the perfect line...here's hoping))
[27-Jan-2013 21:41:35]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((hoping I get the chance later*))
[27-Jan-2013 21:42:04]  <IllFlower> she pulls off her shirt and tears the needles across her torso, letting out an inhuman scream. blood runs everywhere. she throws the needles at a nearby wall, where they embed themselves into the surface, making a splatter the same color as that of the words written there. (more)
[27-Jan-2013 21:42:37]  <Nitya> 14here i was thinking it would be hard to integrate magical girls into Unknown Armies

[27-Jan-2013 21:42:58]  <Yuna> ((you actually made me physically shudder with that line, um, good job illflower?))
[27-Jan-2013 21:42:59]  <IllFlower> and then, just as her screams seem to reach a crescendo, her voice gives out, and the lacerations she's made across her skin simply vanish, as does the blood.
[27-Jan-2013 21:43:07]  <Yui> ((saaaaaame))
[27-Jan-2013 21:43:13]  <Yuna> ((blood magic?))
[27-Jan-2013 21:43:31]  <IllFlower> "I can't be normal... and I can't... atone..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:43:41]  <IllFlower> her voice wavers again.
[27-Jan-2013 21:44:01]  <Nitya> 14epideromancer savant
[27-Jan-2013 21:44:16]  <Sumire> "You can't give up hope, Kei.  You mustn't give up hope."

[27-Jan-2013 21:45:22]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> Miaka turns to shouting, tire . "You used to fight witches! We...we can't tell you what you did is okay, but...you /can/ make up for it. You /have/ to! If you save people's lives...it's got to make up for those lives you've taken away...right?" She looks pleading with the last few words, tears welling.
[27-Jan-2013 21:45:26]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> shouting, dire.*
[27-Jan-2013 21:45:54]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((I can't call for rolls, I assume))
[27-Jan-2013 21:46:09]  <IllFlower> "please, just let me... disappear..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:46:13]  * Yuna retracts inward a bit and hides behind Yui and Miaka
[27-Jan-2013 21:46:35]  <IllFlower> her body, already down on its knees, finally falls over onto the concrete floor.
[27-Jan-2013 21:46:42]  * Yui presses back against Yuna
[27-Jan-2013 21:48:39]  <IllFlower> her shadow, though, is still restless... no, "still" is the wrong word. it grows, spreading across the area Yuna's flashlight has illuminated, then begins to emerge from the wall, like... like flames from a log of firewood. another scream echoes through the room.
[27-Jan-2013 21:49:28]  <Sumire> "W--what's happening?"
[27-Jan-2013 21:49:29]  <IllFlower> the sound of metallic rattling grows, quickly becoming deafening. a toolbox plummets from a high shelf, making a loud crashing noise.
[27-Jan-2013 21:50:04]  <IllFlower> the photographs on the ground begin to float in the air as the shadow starts to cover every wall in the room.
[27-Jan-2013 21:50:47]  <IllFlower> a silver balance clatters onto the floor in the middle of the garage, seemingly having appeared out of thin air. one of its platters breaks into pieces.
[27-Jan-2013 21:51:03]  * Yuna mutters, "S-so this... this is what happens... when a magical girl is consumed by darkness..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:51:18]  <Sumire> "So it seems.  Is this our fate?"
[27-Jan-2013 21:52:07]  <IllFlower> amidst all the chaos, it's almost hard to notice that the shadow has swallowed Kei whole, absorbing her into the wall, which is subsequently blown away to reveal a large, dark cavern...
[27-Jan-2013 21:53:17]  <Yuna> "I don't think it is... as long as we try to keep our kindness and love..."
[27-Jan-2013 21:53:35]  <IllFlower> papered over every surface is an almost incredible collage of photographs, shifting, moving; balances creaking in and out of parity; covered in thread, red and purple and pink and --
[27-Jan-2013 21:54:31]  <IllFlower> a black mass, shifting in and out of the form of Kei's silhouette, appears to face the girls.
[27-Jan-2013 21:54:41]  <Sumire> "K...Kei, are you in there?
[27-Jan-2013 21:54:57]  <IllFlower> Yuna hears a whisper, a regretful whisper -- "Mizuki..."

She smashes the Kruger into the concrete, splintering the ground. The Kruger deforms with the impact, then splinters as well, reforming on Miaka into the familiar claw-and-snubgun from before.

[27-Jan-2013 22:01:07]  <IllFlower> you can either roll for defense, or take passive defense -- but since that's no more than 13, you basically resign yourself to taking damage in the latter case.

[27-Jan-2013 22:02:22]  <IllFlower> (remember that you can take Overcharge dice or strain a relationship for an extra die.)
[27-Jan-2013 22:02:24]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((not that I suggest you take the brunt of what is supposed to be 3 attacks))
[27-Jan-2013 22:02:32]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: one for one. the other two would still hit.
[27-Jan-2013 22:02:36]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ah.
[27-Jan-2013 22:02:36]  <Yuna> +roll 2m6+6
[27-Jan-2013 22:02:36]  <rollermine> Yuna: (4+1)+6=11
[27-Jan-2013 22:02:47]  <Yuna> ((y-yeah... I think I have to take the hit...))
[27-Jan-2013 22:02:53]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> oh, you weren't attacked, yuna
[27-Jan-2013 22:02:59]  <IllFlower> Yuna: you're in luck; it didn't attack you.
[27-Jan-2013 22:03:01]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> :P
[27-Jan-2013 22:03:10]  <IllFlower> okay, so that's a hit for all three?
[27-Jan-2013 22:03:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> yeah, I guess. let's see what damage is like
[27-Jan-2013 22:03:21]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> (+13, as well)
[27-Jan-2013 22:03:33]  <Yuna> ((oh))
[27-Jan-2013 22:03:34]  <Yuna> oops
[27-Jan-2013 22:03:38]  <Yuna> ((I am dumb))
[27-Jan-2013 22:03:40]  <Yuna> (Yui is not Yuna)
[27-Jan-2013 22:03:49]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((it's okay, I thought I was Sumire for the first two sessions))
[27-Jan-2013 22:04:06]  <Yui> ((enmeshment song enmeshment song I'm you you're me together we can go to therapy))
[27-Jan-2013 22:04:30]  <IllFlower> the shroud solidifies, turning into a hail of blades that throws itself at everyone but Yuna.
[27-Jan-2013 22:04:32]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((y'know technically I shoudl listen to elizabeth's theme, since it's more final and I said I would, but...okay yeah let's do this))
[27-Jan-2013 22:04:50]  <IllFlower> +roll 2d6+6+2+4
[27-Jan-2013 22:04:50]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (6+1)+6+2+4=19
[27-Jan-2013 22:04:58]  <IllFlower> anyone want to change their minds?
[27-Jan-2013 22:04:59]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((uh))
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:00]  <Yuna> (( Yui: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH6NB2F-Jcw ))
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:01]  <Omnipresence> 14URL: [www.youtube.com] (Lyrics & Subtitles) Miki Sayaka & Sakura Kyouko Character Song - And I'm Home - YouTube
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:08]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((is that 19 each, because like))
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:11]  <IllFlower> 19 each.
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:15]  <Sumire> 14oh shit
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:18]  <Yui> ((ow))
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:19]  <Yuna> ((?????))
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:26]  <Yuna> (( I thought damage was 1d6...))
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:29]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((the hell can we do during defense anyway? or are you just giving us a chance to load up on OC))
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:34]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> on OC and retcon the successful attack*
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:40]  <IllFlower> Yuna: special ability that adds d6 for this first round only.
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:49]  <Yuna> ((@_______@))
[27-Jan-2013 22:05:55]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: if you want to respond by adding dice, this is your chance.
[27-Jan-2013 22:06:05]  <Yuna> that's insane ;-;
[27-Jan-2013 22:06:07]  <Sumire> 14how many dice would I need though
[27-Jan-2013 22:06:13]  <BGTB2005> 14...they do have life insurance, right?
[27-Jan-2013 22:06:21]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((thirty minus whatever you rolled originally))
[27-Jan-2013 22:06:30]  <IllFlower> Sumire didn't roll.
[27-Jan-2013 22:06:35]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((oh.))
[27-Jan-2013 22:06:41]  <Sumire> 14oh right.  well, shit
[27-Jan-2013 22:06:54]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((well fuck lol, that means I would need 4 OC dice on my defense, this turn, to block))
[27-Jan-2013 22:07:03]  <Sumire> 14you can also strain relationships
[27-Jan-2013 22:07:07]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> true...
[27-Jan-2013 22:07:15]  <Yuna> ((Could they clash?))
[27-Jan-2013 22:07:29]  <Yuna> ((Then at least the OC would get them +2s...))
[27-Jan-2013 22:07:42]  <IllFlower> if you'd rather clash, you can elect to do so now.
[27-Jan-2013 22:07:52]  <Yuna> (straining plus OCs... ick)
[27-Jan-2013 22:07:53]  <IllFlower> that'll let you use your attack attribute, which is higher.
[27-Jan-2013 22:07:56]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "If youve made a roll for a Challenge and you need a better result, you can put a point of Strain on a relationship that has the same attribute to add +1 to your Result (and add +1 to the damage if its an attack)." this does not seem like twenty.
[27-Jan-2013 22:09:48]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> well okay, if you're givin' me the chance, then I /guess/ I'll re-roll to attempt a clash, because I have no options otherwise.
[27-Jan-2013 22:10:04]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> and I'd also be KO'd anyway if this fucks up
[27-Jan-2013 22:10:13]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> +2m6+8 >extra dice to be determined
[27-Jan-2013 22:10:18]  <Sumire> 14you'd be detransformed and have to revive
[27-Jan-2013 22:10:25]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> +2m6+8
[27-Jan-2013 22:10:27]  <IllFlower> you forgot the roll part, Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]
[27-Jan-2013 22:10:28]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> oh.
[27-Jan-2013 22:10:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> +roll 2m6+8
[27-Jan-2013 22:10:31]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: (2+4)+8=14
[27-Jan-2013 22:10:56]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> so, let's try two fury OC...
[27-Jan-2013 22:11:03]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> +roll 2d6
[27-Jan-2013 22:11:03]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: (4+4)=8
[27-Jan-2013 22:11:13]  <Yui> ((William and I have to leave in about an hour twenty))
[27-Jan-2013 22:11:43]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: 22 so far.
[27-Jan-2013 22:12:00]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ....alright, I'll go up to 4 for the clash attempt.
[27-Jan-2013 22:12:02]  <IllFlower> 30 attack result is still out against Yui and Sumire.
[27-Jan-2013 22:12:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> well, it's still out for me too until this, if it even works :P
[27-Jan-2013 22:12:17]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> +roll 2d6
[27-Jan-2013 22:12:18]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: (4+3)=7
[27-Jan-2013 22:12:18]  <Sumire> 14I didn't roll dice, so I don't think I can do anything; I'm basically detransformed
[27-Jan-2013 22:12:31]  <IllFlower> Sumire: you can elect to change that if you want.
[27-Jan-2013 22:12:50]  <Sumire> 14In that case, I'll defend and then add overcharge
[27-Jan-2013 22:12:57]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: 29.
[27-Jan-2013 22:13:08]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> so if I take strain I get 1 more /die/, or 1 more on the result?
[27-Jan-2013 22:13:13]  <Sumire> +roll 2m6+8 >! again, will add more overcharge dice
[27-Jan-2013 22:13:13]  <rollermine> (2+(6+5))+8=21
[27-Jan-2013 22:13:23]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: result, period, but you'd need 2 to win outright.
[27-Jan-2013 22:13:26]  <Yuna> ((make sureyou win on the clash, so you get to hit the witchthing back))
[27-Jan-2013 22:13:32]  <Yuna> ((tiebreaks or something?))
[27-Jan-2013 22:13:47]  <Sumire> 14do I get to choose which attribute I put overcharge dice into?
[27-Jan-2013 22:13:59]  <IllFlower> Yuna: tiebreak falls back on the base attribute, which is 13 vs. 8.
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:06]  <IllFlower> Sumire: no, it's your defense attribute.
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ...alright, let's get dangerous. 5 OC
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:17]  <Sumire> 14 could I also put the shield up?
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:19]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> +roll d6
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:19]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: 3=3
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:20]  <Yuna> ((oh, the +6 counts as the base attribute?))
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:23]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> eat it, witch
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:25]  <IllFlower> Sumire: you could.
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:33]  <Yuna> ((oh, the base is 13, and there's a +1d6 to damage, or something))
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:35]  *** AttObl|MapleStory is now known as AttObl|PathOfExile
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:47]  <Sumire> 14 I'll do two extra OC dice
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:48]  <Sumire> +roll 2m6
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:49]  <rollermine> Sumire: (5+5)=10
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:51]  <Yuna> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: you are going to hit that witch insanely hard
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:52]  <IllFlower> Sumire: since defense doesn't take your turn. putting the shield up does, though.
[27-Jan-2013 22:14:58]  <Nitya> 14the witch is defeated.  barcode is reduced to nuclear waste
[27-Jan-2013 22:15:01]  <Sumire> 14 no shield, actually, since 21+10=31
[27-Jan-2013 22:15:02]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> lol
[27-Jan-2013 22:15:14]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> Yuna: well, more like "I'll hit it, and then roll 1+1+4 on the actual strike
[27-Jan-2013 22:15:15]  <Sumire> 14but three magic overcharge diec
[27-Jan-2013 22:15:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "
[27-Jan-2013 22:15:22]  <Yuna> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: +2 per overcharge
[27-Jan-2013 22:15:33]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> !?
[27-Jan-2013 22:15:42]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: 32. that's a win plus 5 Fr OC. roll d6+4+10.
[27-Jan-2013 22:15:46]  <Yuna> +2 damage per overcharge
[27-Jan-2013 22:15:50]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> sweet.
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:00]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> hope you guy sdon't mind fighting another wtich after this
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> +roll d6+4+10
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:05]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: 3+4+10=17
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:10]  <Sumire> 14you need eight to witchify
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:12]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> stand by for attack description
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:17]  <IllFlower> Sumire: 3 Ht OC.
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:21]  <IllFlower> attack fails.
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:22]  <Yuna> fury doesn't create witches anyways
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:45]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: 17 damage.
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:49]  <Sumire> 14I might have to describe the fallout after the session
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:50]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((yup, one second))
[27-Jan-2013 22:16:55]  <IllFlower> still need to hear back from Yui...
[27-Jan-2013 22:17:14]  <Yui> am I allowed to take overcharge on defense as well?
[27-Jan-2013 22:17:19]  <IllFlower> yup. any magical roll.
[27-Jan-2013 22:17:30]  <Yui> okay.
[27-Jan-2013 22:17:45]  <IllFlower> you're at 12 right now, or you can try to clash and attack the witch back instead (though this takes your turn).
[27-Jan-2013 22:17:53]  <Yui> +roll 2m6+4
[27-Jan-2013 22:17:53]  <rollermine> Yui: ((6+2)+1)+4=13
[27-Jan-2013 22:18:20]  <IllFlower> 13. need 30 to defend.
[27-Jan-2013 22:18:39]  <Yuna> ((not clashing seems like a waste, since it means the overcharge don't go into damaging the witch))
[27-Jan-2013 22:19:01]  <Yui> ((nrrrgh, good point, babeorama))
[27-Jan-2013 22:19:04]  <IllFlower> meanwhile: Sumire manages to jump out of the way of the flying blades, only taking a cosmetic nick or two.
[27-Jan-2013 22:19:08]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> Miaka's eyes flare - literally. Red streaks of aethereal flame geyser out of her eye sockets, obscuring her eyes completely. She jumps over the shroud and charges the witch, screaming inhumanly and firing blood-red bolts out of the Kruger on her approach. She beats and tears Kei's silhouette savagely, alternating through rending swipes with the gauntlet and pounding her overhead with the Kruger.
[27-Jan-2013 22:19:37]  <IllFlower> oh, I was just going to have Miaka knock some of the blades back at the witch. but that works too. :D
[27-Jan-2013 22:19:39]  <Yuna> ((nice job at, um, only taking 3 OC though Sumire XD))
[27-Jan-2013 22:19:49]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> wait, so I do less damage, huh
[27-Jan-2013 22:19:51]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> or no
[27-Jan-2013 22:19:56]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> oh, not clashing, nm
[27-Jan-2013 22:19:59]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]>  /not/*
[27-Jan-2013 22:20:28]  <IllFlower> Yui: if you want to clash, base is 2m6+8, plus whatever OC dice you elect to take.
[27-Jan-2013 22:20:44]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> yuna: not clashing lets you spread out your OC better. so you dojn't end up shoving your thumbs all the way into someone's skull through their eyes once you exit the Nightmare
[27-Jan-2013 22:20:53]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> end up losing it and shoving your*
[27-Jan-2013 22:21:13]  <Nitya> 14good to know you've thought your strategy through
[27-Jan-2013 22:21:13]  <Yuna> (good point, I guess I can swap attributes around later to try to limit that)

[27-Jan-2013 22:21:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> guess who isn't going to be Support-ing anyone for the rest of the matchup :P
[27-Jan-2013 22:21:46]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> although, smelling like blood for a few hours would be pretty sweet

[27-Jan-2013 22:23:32]  <Yuna> wait, 6??
[27-Jan-2013 22:23:37]  <IllFlower> Yuna, you can attempt to Clash as well, to block the witch's attack on Yui.
[27-Jan-2013 22:23:41]  <IllFlower> just a note.
[27-Jan-2013 22:23:41]  <Yui> still have 2 from last time
[27-Jan-2013 22:23:43]  <Yuna> oh...
[27-Jan-2013 22:23:49]  <Yuna> does she still get all those OC then?
[27-Jan-2013 22:23:53]  <Yuna> if her clash doesn't count
[27-Jan-2013 22:23:56]  <IllFlower> in which case I'll wipe the OC, but you'll probably have to take some.
[27-Jan-2013 22:23:57]  <Yuna> i.e. can I retcon them >.>
[27-Jan-2013 22:24:00]  <Yuna> okay!
[27-Jan-2013 22:24:07]  * Yuna dives in after Yui.

[27-Jan-2013 22:25:00]  <Sumire> 14you can strain two relationships
[27-Jan-2013 22:25:02]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: you can narrate fine, just make sure you tell me explicitly if you want to take Fallout or not.
[27-Jan-2013 22:25:19]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> aight. yeah obviously I can't take fallout in the middle of the fight
[27-Jan-2013 22:25:28]  <IllFlower> you can, actually, once you hit 6.
[27-Jan-2013 22:25:32]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> oh right.
[27-Jan-2013 22:25:47]  <IllFlower> Sumire: you also still have your turn, so you can shield if you wish.

[27-Jan-2013 22:28:39]  <IllFlower> Yuna and Miaka clashed, so their turns are taken. once Yuna describes her counterattack, it's Sumire's turn.
[27-Jan-2013 22:29:09]  <IllFlower> er, well, I've got one thing to put in after Yuna's counterattack, and *then* it's Sumire's turn.
[27-Jan-2013 22:29:34]  * Yuna dives in after Yuna, her flashlight beaming brighter and brigher as she flies towards.  The beam gets brighter and brighter and sears away the incoming blades, their fragments recoiling into the witch like a hailstorm of shrapnel.
[27-Jan-2013 22:29:39]  <Yuna> .... *after Yui

[27-Jan-2013 22:31:50]  <IllFlower> as Yuna and Miaka pull away from the witch, the witch suddenly issues another loud scream, knocking them both back with the force of an explosion. 2 damage each.
[27-Jan-2013 22:31:54]  <IllFlower> Sumire's turn.

[27-Jan-2013 22:39:29]  <Sumire> Sumire readies her wand, aiming it at the witch, drawing her into a defensive stance---then suddenly spins 180 degrees, aiming herself at a portal.  "SHARDS!", as glass shards---more closely resembling needles than ever before---stream out of her wand, towards the portal, and at the silhouette, which the other end of the portal pointed to.

[27-Jan-2013 22:48:12]  <Yui> "I've heard about fighting fire with fire, let's see if it holds for Shadow. Yui grabs her rolling pin and rolls it down the front of her apron with cutesy sugar cookie shadows streaming off in rapid motion towards the witch. strings of shadow like the dough left behind streams forth as well.

[27-Jan-2013 22:49:28]  <IllFlower> the witch is able to knock some of the shadow streamers back at Yui, causing her some damage, but the rest of them impact her full force, opening up holes in the witch's body.

[27-Jan-2013 22:51:07]  <IllFlower> it goes up in smoke, something that looks like Kei smiling, shedding a tear, or maybe it's a trick of the eyes --
[27-Jan-2013 22:51:51]  <IllFlower> and then the flames catch the walls of the cavern, and the whole place flashes over into flames in a fraction of a second, as the photographs lining the walls turn to kindling --

She got up quickly, but the other girls seemed to take care of the job fast enough. She looked up at Kei's...ignition, blankly.

[27-Jan-2013 23:02:49]  <IllFlower> you can elect to Change and wipe out 7 OC instead; that's sufficient.

[27-Jan-2013 23:04:50]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: that's for Mg OC.

[27-Jan-2013 23:05:43]  <Sumire> 1461. Heavy Metal Costume doesn't seem like a change
[27-Jan-2013 23:05:48]  <Sumire> 14I think it'd be a permanent change, actually
[27-Jan-2013 23:05:54]  <IllFlower> so basically -- you can elect to take a random -- permanent -- Change to eliminate 7 OC (or 6, but I'd do 7 :p), or fall into a Rage Storm.

[27-Jan-2013 23:08:15]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((alright, game master. have your way.))
[27-Jan-2013 23:08:18]  <Sumire> 14you can return later w/ the change
[27-Jan-2013 23:08:28]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((do I roll for it?))
[27-Jan-2013 23:08:35]  <IllFlower> just saying, the other players might not be happy with fighting each other ;)
[27-Jan-2013 23:08:41]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((no no, yeah, I understand.))
[27-Jan-2013 23:08:44]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: roll 2d6
[27-Jan-2013 23:08:47]  <Sumire> 14yeah; +roll 10*d6+d6
[27-Jan-2013 23:08:56]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> +roll 10*d6+d6
[27-Jan-2013 23:08:56]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: 10=10
[27-Jan-2013 23:09:01]  <Sumire> ...or not
[27-Jan-2013 23:09:10]  <Sumire> will need to check out parser >_<
[27-Jan-2013 23:09:11]  <IllFlower> just roll 2d6 :p
[27-Jan-2013 23:09:20]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> +roll 2d6
[27-Jan-2013 23:09:20]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: (1+3)=4
[27-Jan-2013 23:09:30]  <IllFlower> okay, Fury change 13.
[27-Jan-2013 23:09:34]  <Sumire> 1413: Canine Animosity
[27-Jan-2013 23:09:36]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((oh.))
[27-Jan-2013 23:09:52]  <SpruceZeus> ((So like that one scene in Nichijou >_>))
[27-Jan-2013 23:09:57]  <IllFlower> or, actually, you know what
[27-Jan-2013 23:10:01]  <BGTB2005> 14Does Not Like dogs?
[27-Jan-2013 23:10:02]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((well, that was certainly better than something like "Every now and then you start screaming involuntarily."))
[27-Jan-2013 23:10:13]  <IllFlower> you can also look through the tables and find a Change that you think suits what happened
[27-Jan-2013 23:10:14]  <Sumire> 14like the Terminator, Sprucey
[27-Jan-2013 23:10:20]  <IllFlower> pp. 27-29
[27-Jan-2013 23:11:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> (well the obvious one would be bloody red eyes but is that too lame))
[27-Jan-2013 23:11:42]  <IllFlower> (21, 25, 31, 55 all seem like they might be fun :D)
[27-Jan-2013 23:12:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((violence trigger could be cool...))
[27-Jan-2013 23:12:45]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((shadow would make sense with the witch, but))
[27-Jan-2013 23:12:59]  <IllFlower> that's also the Change Kei had, imagine that :p
[27-Jan-2013 23:13:07]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((yeh, s'why I mentioned it :P))
[27-Jan-2013 23:13:12]  <Sumire> 14what was Kei's trigger?
[27-Jan-2013 23:13:21]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((wait, what, the violence one?))
[27-Jan-2013 23:14:21]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((also if I did 25 and woudl put it on my abdomen or something that'd just mak the BRS thing more obvious -_-))
[27-Jan-2013 23:14:27]  <IllFlower> Sumire: no, the shadow one.
[27-Jan-2013 23:14:38]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((I do really like the shadow one))
[27-Jan-2013 23:15:19]  <BGTB2005> 14eat a sun god, gain nuclear powers
[27-Jan-2013 23:15:27]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]: want to take that one, then?
[27-Jan-2013 23:15:27]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((would that be fine, then..?))
[27-Jan-2013 23:15:30]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((yeh.))
[27-Jan-2013 23:15:49]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((hell, it almost works with the vein thing I mentioned too))
[27-Jan-2013 23:15:58]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> the temporary vein thing*
[27-Jan-2013 23:15:58]  <IllFlower> okay, done.
[27-Jan-2013 23:16:00]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((sorry about the delays, everyone))
[27-Jan-2013 23:16:13]  <IllFlower> the four of you are out of the maze. now just roleplay the aftermath!
[27-Jan-2013 23:16:16]  <IllFlower> 15 minutes!
[27-Jan-2013 23:16:47]  <Yui> poni's in the bathroom rn
[27-Jan-2013 23:16:59]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] slows down as she makes it a few steps away from the ((burning?)) building, shaking. Her knees are rattling together, made more audible by the metallic kneepads rattling.
[27-Jan-2013 23:17:07]  *** Nitya <~Glossina@63-229-134-7.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[27-Jan-2013 23:17:08]  <Yui> and back
[27-Jan-2013 23:17:55]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] transforms back and collapses on the grass just outside of the paved area.
[27-Jan-2013 23:18:37]  <Sumire> "Is....is that what's going to happen to all of us?"
[27-Jan-2013 23:19:04]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> She's pale, looking blankly across the ground. She does seem to be breathing, but aside from glancing at Sumire, she offers no response to the question.
[27-Jan-2013 23:19:18]  <jseblan> whoa hey, Rose Lalonde was introduced on my birthday
[27-Jan-2013 23:19:21]  <jseblan> I never noticed
[27-Jan-2013 23:19:30]  * Yuna kneels down next to Miaki and looks her over
[27-Jan-2013 23:19:40]  <SpruceZeus> ((uh jseblan i think you are in the wrong tab >_>))
[27-Jan-2013 23:19:42]  <Yuna> (um, should we do our overcharge stuff now ?)
[27-Jan-2013 23:19:44]  * IllFlower hooks jseblan and drags him off the stage
[27-Jan-2013 23:19:49]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((heh))
[27-Jan-2013 23:19:59]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((well, maybe you guys should take them next session or something? I'll like get up now and))
[27-Jan-2013 23:20:13]  <SpruceZeus> ((@IllFlower: *slide whistle*))
[27-Jan-2013 23:20:13]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((plus then you can take a point off and all that? iunno.))
[27-Jan-2013 23:20:15]  <IllFlower> Yuna: none of you are at 6 any more, so you can elect to not do so and simply remove 1 OC per attribute after this session is over.
[27-Jan-2013 23:20:15]  <Sumire> 14I think I might do that, simply because I'm kindo f pressed for time
[27-Jan-2013 23:20:24]  <Yuna> ((okay))
[27-Jan-2013 23:20:28]  <Sumire> 14I think I'll do that.
[27-Jan-2013 23:21:22]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] continues to stare across the grass. The flames appear to play strange shadows across her body. She begins to stir.
[27-Jan-2013 23:22:02]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> "Kei...I...hope you're happy, now..."
[27-Jan-2013 23:22:42]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] gets up. As she stands, though, her shadow stays in place.
[27-Jan-2013 23:22:57]  <IllFlower> behind the initiates, the garage is now engulfed in flames, burning away whatever flammable material may have been left behind. the offices, apparently built of wood, are unrecognizable.
[27-Jan-2013 23:23:08]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((er, shit. shoudl I leave the shadowshit to you))
[27-Jan-2013 23:23:14]  <IllFlower> no, keep going.
[27-Jan-2013 23:23:35]  <Sumire> "I wonder if anyone will actually notice that building go up in flames."
[27-Jan-2013 23:23:50]  <Yuna> The fire departmne tmight be here soon...
[27-Jan-2013 23:23:55]  <IllFlower> the sound of sirens can be heard in the background, more at once than the girls can ever remember hearing.
[27-Jan-2013 23:24:05]  <Yuna> W-we... we should ge tout of here....
[27-Jan-2013 23:24:30]  <Sumire> "Yeah, that would be a good idea."
[27-Jan-2013 23:24:37]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((**?))
[27-Jan-2013 23:24:46]  <IllFlower> (keep going, but everyone -- Sumire and Yui especially -- tell me who you're gifting your XP to.)
[27-Jan-2013 23:24:49]  <IllFlower> **
[27-Jan-2013 23:25:01]  <Sumire> 14gift to Yui for killing the monster with bunnies
[27-Jan-2013 23:25:20]  <Yui> to Yuna for covering my butt when I was gonnna die
[27-Jan-2013 23:25:45]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((to sumire, for equality and for doing the hand-grab thing when I didn't expect it))
[27-Jan-2013 23:26:20]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] sways as she stands, still pale, now  sweating. The shadow appears to project from her feet outwards, but...it remains laying there. It appears to be... fraying?
[27-Jan-2013 23:27:03]  <Yuna> to Miaki for somehow managing 11 overcharge
[27-Jan-2013 23:27:05]  * Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode] (is looking at the flames, though, unaware)
[27-Jan-2013 23:28:04]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((yo, guys, if you see it...))
[27-Jan-2013 23:28:36]  <SpruceZeus> ((sharp check >_>))
[27-Jan-2013 23:28:43]  <Sumire> 14when you see it, you'll shit bricks
[27-Jan-2013 23:28:44]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((bah, just point it out and I'll turn around and sumfn'll happen))
[27-Jan-2013 23:30:22]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((yuna?))
[27-Jan-2013 23:31:36]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((where did everyone go .-.))
[27-Jan-2013 23:32:15]  <IllFlower> ponicalica and buttercupistiny have to be someplace. looks like it's going to be just Miaka and Yuna right now.
[27-Jan-2013 23:32:17]  <Yuna> ((I duno...?))
[27-Jan-2013 23:32:23]  <Yuna> ((Um, I don't know what to do @_@))
[27-Jan-2013 23:32:28]  <Yuna> ((I was hoping to let other peopel carry things...))
[27-Jan-2013 23:32:38]  <IllFlower> roll 2d6+7.
[27-Jan-2013 23:32:40]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((ah, sorry. okay well, they can read this when they get back I guess. just like mention that I am standing but there is a flat shadow behidn me :P))
[27-Jan-2013 23:32:45]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((or sharp check I Guess))
[27-Jan-2013 23:32:45]  <Sumire> 14I think the session is basically over :p
[27-Jan-2013 23:33:18]  <IllFlower> battle's over. presumably this isn't a scenario where the characters can just walk away feeling okay, though.
[27-Jan-2013 23:33:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((I got this all typed out, yall))
[27-Jan-2013 23:35:04]  *** jseblan <~quassel@CPEbcc81007908e-CMbcc81007908b.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has left #madokamadness
[27-Jan-2013 23:35:06]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((yuna: if anything you can just be like <<yuna was standing behind miaka and noticed this inconsistency. "miaka, your...shadow..."))
[27-Jan-2013 23:35:12]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> >>))*
[27-Jan-2013 23:35:48]  <IllFlower> ("chaos. disorder. nobody can remember what happened next. everyone woke up and... white, blank...")
[27-Jan-2013 23:36:03]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((I can just paste in the description if nobody specifically wants to say anything))
[27-Jan-2013 23:36:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> Miaka seems to feel a chill across her body; she turns around, dazed, and looks at the ground in front of her. The shadow seemingly turns over as she does so, as if it were a human being rolling over, and the shadow seems to come into unnatural focus; but now it has become apparent that the fraying is actually rotting. The girlish silhouette rapidly gives away to a collapsing skeletal frame, writhing as if i
[27-Jan-2013 23:36:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> t were suffering through this process. Miaka faints; as she hits the ground once more, her shadow blinks back to normal.
[27-Jan-2013 23:36:45]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((there.))
[27-Jan-2013 23:36:58]  <Yuna> (it's hard to play without the other two, but um... okay)
[27-Jan-2013 23:37:16]  <Yuna> Miaka.... your shadow... it's... it's moving weirdly.  Like Kei's...
[27-Jan-2013 23:37:23]  <Yuna> Did you get... infected?
[27-Jan-2013 23:37:39]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((oh, okay.)) well, that was said, and then the description*
[27-Jan-2013 23:37:48]  <IllFlower> (Yui and Sumire suddenly got bitten by a yuri bug and decided to have a wholly inappropriately timed escapade...)
[27-Jan-2013 23:38:03]  <Yuna> (is that a heart fallout?)
[27-Jan-2013 23:38:08]  <IllFlower> (a joke.)
[27-Jan-2013 23:38:15]  <Yuna> (I was kidding too)
[27-Jan-2013 23:38:35]  <IllFlower> (jokes are Mg.)
[27-Jan-2013 23:38:39]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((heh))
[27-Jan-2013 23:39:30]  <IllFlower> actually, mind if I take over?
[27-Jan-2013 23:39:34]  <Miaka_Watanabe[Barcode]> ((sorry this was such a clusterfuck, I get a little nervous when it comes to actual consequences in-game. and yeah why not))
[27-Jan-2013 23:40:52]  <IllFlower> as Miaka hits the ground, she notices that Sumire and Yui -- wait, weren't they just up and talking a second ago? -- are sprawled out on the driveway of the repair shop, about a meter away from each other.
[27-Jan-2013 23:43:01]  <IllFlower> Miaka points towards them, trying to get Yuna's attention. Yuna looks behind her and gasps as she sees the other two fallen on the ground, but soon she too seems to succumb to whatever took them down, and slumps down in front of Miaka.
[27-Jan-2013 23:43:49]  <IllFlower> her hand outstretched, Miaka loses the last of her strength, just as the blue and red of sirens begin to illuminate the concrete in front of her...
[27-Jan-2013 23:44:23]  <IllFlower> (da-dun.) that's all. we'll resume on Wednesday as usual. thanks for playing, everyone!
