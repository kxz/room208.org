[03-Mar-2013 20:37:36]  <IllFlower> The winter holidays, as usual, are far too short, and before she knows it, Yui is back on the hill up to school, the stiff breeze making the morning commute twice as hard as it needs to be.

[03-Mar-2013 20:57:08]  <IllFlower> Yui begins to pull for her own indoor shoes, but notices an unmarked envelope sitting on top of them when she opens her own locker. **

[03-Mar-2013 20:58:35]  <ponicalica> 14oh, okay
[03-Mar-2013 20:58:54]  <Yui> Yui looks at the envelope quizzically and holds it up at eyelevel towards the nearest light source before opening it
[03-Mar-2013 20:59:54]  <IllFlower> The envelope contains a single photograph, printed on cheap glossy paper.

[03-Mar-2013 21:02:05]  <IllFlower> At the center of the frame is, Yui makes out with some difficulty thanks to a combination of blur and camera noise, the tree that had contained the witch. Snezana is standing next to it, her hand touching its trunk. **
[03-Mar-2013 21:02:27]  <IllFlower> (The tree is still intact in this photo, to clarify.)
[03-Mar-2013 21:02:40]  <Snezana> (I'm being followed it seems))
[03-Mar-2013 21:03:26]  <ponicalica> 14comedy end: it's Miaka's photo.  She's gawking at the foreigner
[03-Mar-2013 21:05:20]  <Yui> "well that's... odd. To say the least" Yui murmurs as she sets the photo down to slip her shoes on. Even if things are going super weird, now is not the time to get in trouble at school on top of it. She picks the photo and envelope back up and wonders who would have taken this picture, let alone could have, and when.
[03-Mar-2013 21:05:47]  <IllFlower> As Yui picks up the photo again, she notices some writing on the reverse side.
[03-Mar-2013 21:06:18]  <IllFlower> Running down the back, in a line of lazily-written characters, is the phrase "beware the friendly stranger." **
[03-Mar-2013 21:06:45]  <Yui> ((dun dun duuuuuuuuuuuuun))
[03-Mar-2013 21:08:00]  <Snezana> ((ot oh))
[03-Mar-2013 21:08:03]  <Yui> "Huh. Weird." Yui remarks, flipping the photo back over and squinting at Snezana.
[03-Mar-2013 21:08:30]  <Yui> "There have been lots of friendly strangers lately, wonder what's so special about this one"

[03-Mar-2013 21:09:46]  <IllFlower> Yui decides that now isn't the time to figure this out. She slips the photo back inside the envelope, which she in turn puts in her school bag, and heads on to her first class.

[03-Mar-2013 21:11:28]  <IllFlower> On arriving in the classroom, Yui scans around for Makoto, wondering if she'd have anything to say about this, but Makoto doesn't appear even in time for first period.

[03-Mar-2013 22:04:53]  <Snezana> "Pyun do you have any idea what's writing on the back... and I thought you took this photo, Yui."
[03-Mar-2013 22:05:11]  * Snezana closes her eye, trying to recollect some memory of the day, but comes up empty
[03-Mar-2013 22:05:14]  <Snezana> eyes*
[03-Mar-2013 22:05:34]  <Snezana> "I don't remember seeing anyone with a camera, maybe someone had a cellphone..."
[03-Mar-2013 22:05:54]  <Yui> "Nope. Wasn't me. This was just sitting on top of my shoes in my locker this morning"
[03-Mar-2013 22:06:31]  <IllFlower> "Let me ask you something.
[03-Mar-2013 22:06:46]  <IllFlower> "Had the two of you met before this picture was taken?" **
[03-Mar-2013 22:07:17]  <Yui> "Not to my knowledge."
[03-Mar-2013 22:07:37]  * Snezana shrugs
[03-Mar-2013 22:08:10]  <IllFlower> "So the only interaction between you two has, so far, been fighting a witch together.
[03-Mar-2013 22:08:23]  <Snezana> "Maybe I bumped into her on the street when I was about"
[03-Mar-2013 22:09:12]  <IllFlower> "Now, I don't really use money, but I'd wager a good amount of it that Makoto got something like this too.
[03-Mar-2013 22:09:34]  <IllFlower> "And those words on the back. 'Beware the friendly stranger.' They certainly don't sound friendly." **
[03-Mar-2013 22:10:38]  * Snezana looks closely at the writing, twitching at the mention of 'friendly stanger'
[03-Mar-2013 22:11:07]  <Snezana> "That was the exact term used? 'Friendly stranger'"
[03-Mar-2013 22:11:51]  <IllFlower> "Mayu, I don't suppose you'd be able to explain?" **
[03-Mar-2013 22:12:00]  <Yui> yeah, why? Have you heard it in another context?
[03-Mar-2013 22:13:11]  * Snezana nervously hands the picture back to Yui
[03-Mar-2013 22:13:44]  * Yui takes the picture and sets it back in her backpack

[03-Mar-2013 22:15:23]  * Snezana falls into deep thought
[03-Mar-2013 22:15:25]  <Yui> "reserved?"
[03-Mar-2013 22:16:56]  <Snezana> "You can call it being reserved. the war makes you cautious around other initiates. I... I was a wanderer, which was unusual."
[03-Mar-2013 22:17:38]  <Snezana> "But its impossible that anyone that... the only people who know I'm sure wouldn't follow me here."

[03-Mar-2013 22:50:54]  <Yui> I sure hope so. It might be harder to get roped into magical scenarios if I'm with my friends from school as well.

[03-Mar-2013 23:15:45]  <IllFlower> Yui finishes up a problem and leans back against the nearby sofa, satisfied with her progress.
[03-Mar-2013 23:17:20]  <IllFlower> She takes a look at the television screen. Something about the police breaking up a suicide ring...?

[03-Mar-2013 23:29:14]  <IllFlower> Yuna's.
