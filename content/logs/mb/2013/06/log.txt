[25-Jan-2013 02:18:59]  <IllFlower> and let's get this session started.
[25-Jan-2013 02:20:51]  <IllFlower> Saturday afternoon's turned into evening, the cold December air seeming to seep through the bullet train's thick windows.
[25-Jan-2013 02:21:19]  <IllFlower> Yuna is sitting alone in a seat, Pyunpyun on her lap, as the two head towards Osaka.
[25-Jan-2013 02:22:15]  <IllFlower> a newspaper sits in the empty seat across from them, turned to an article on Haruka's reappearance.
[25-Jan-2013 02:23:17]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun breaks the silence. "how are you feeling, Yuna?" **
[25-Jan-2013 02:24:03]  <Fiora> ((Are there other people in the car?  I'm going to look silly talking to thin air... or are we using telepathy?))
[25-Jan-2013 02:24:08]  <Yuna> ((oops, wrong window))
[25-Jan-2013 02:24:40]  <IllFlower> you can assume Pyunpyun's usual Somebody Else's Problem field is up and running.
[25-Jan-2013 02:24:58]  <Yuna> ((Yay!)
[25-Jan-2013 02:25:30]  <Yuna> ((Um, do I know anything about Haruka?))

[25-Jan-2013 02:25:48]  <IllFlower> Yuna: only what's been given you in the setting materials.
[25-Jan-2013 02:26:34]  <Yuna> I'm..... still a little shaky, I think...
[25-Jan-2013 02:26:46]  <Yuna> But we won last time, so... I should be happy
[25-Jan-2013 02:28:24]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun pauses. "did you hear about what happened to Namie? from Aoi and the others?"
[25-Jan-2013 02:28:37]  <IllFlower> **
[25-Jan-2013 02:29:08]  <Yuna> S-she... she was taken by a witch, right...?  I don't know much more...
[25-Jan-2013 02:29:13]  <Yuna> I'm guessing it was just like with Irie...
[25-Jan-2013 02:29:22]  <Nitya> 14that's right, me, your friendly witch newspaperboy
[25-Jan-2013 02:31:21]  <IllFlower> "yes... maybe I don't understand, but it seems a bit strange to me that" -- Pyunpyun jumps over to the opposite seat -- "even after you know two people have died, you think you 'should be happy'..." **
[25-Jan-2013 02:33:30]  <IllFlower> Nitya: here's your hat. I hope you don't get tired of shouting "EXTRA! EXTRA!"
[25-Jan-2013 02:33:49]  <Yuna> S-sorry... I don't really know... I've felt kind of a mess since that last witch.
[25-Jan-2013 02:34:05]  <Nitya> 14grumpy soulful animeop stealing ideas from psx-era final fantasy titles!  extra, extra, read all about it!
[25-Jan-2013 02:34:40]  <IllFlower> Nitya: you use weird adjectives.
[25-Jan-2013 02:35:03]  <Nitya> 14SOULFUL adjectives!
[25-Jan-2013 02:36:10]  <IllFlower> Yuna: "you don't have to apologize to me. it just seemed like an... odd burden to place on yourself." **
[25-Jan-2013 02:37:09]  <Yuna> "Well, um... if I'm all upset, I can't fight witches very well can I?"
[25-Jan-2013 02:37:49]  <IllFlower> Nitya: and if you're referring to me, I've not ever touched a Final Fantasy game. funnily enough.
[25-Jan-2013 02:38:33]  <Nitya> 14yeah, i know.
[25-Jan-2013 02:38:41]  <Nitya> 14my rag is yellow.
[25-Jan-2013 02:38:47]  <IllFlower> the train passes by a small city, its lights glistening in the distance.
[25-Jan-2013 02:38:49]  *** Kriegscomputer[empty] is now known as Barcodrawing
[25-Jan-2013 02:39:39]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun turns to look out the window. "perhaps, but holding yourself back might be just as dangerous." **
[25-Jan-2013 02:40:26]  <Yuna> I... I guess you're right... I can't pretend the tears aren't there, anyways...
[25-Jan-2013 02:40:39]  <Nitya> 14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ7T4v0gr7g for reference
[25-Jan-2013 02:42:20]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun remains silent, his tail waving back and forth as if rustling in some invisible wind.
[25-Jan-2013 02:43:08]  <IllFlower> before long, the train announces that it's pulling into Shin-Osaka station, and the two disembark.
[25-Jan-2013 02:43:43]  <IllFlower> Yuna briefly wonders how they'll get to the hospital Haruka is staying in, but Pyunpyun simply tells her to wave down a taxi.

[25-Jan-2013 02:44:41]  <IllFlower> he waves off any concern about the fare, pulling a few banknotes out of thin air to reassure her.
[25-Jan-2013 02:45:34]  <Yuna> Gosh, did you really just... where did you get those?    
[25-Jan-2013 02:45:39]  * Yuna mutters quietly  "um, and can I have some maybe"
[25-Jan-2013 02:46:55]  <IllFlower> "Shirakawa would kill me," he mutters almost inaudibly, before suddenly changing his tone of voice and saying simply "you know I can't do that!" in an oddly cheery voice.
[25-Jan-2013 02:48:14]  <Yuna> ((gosh I love your references))
[25-Jan-2013 02:48:25]  <Yuna> O-okay... I guess I should have expected that.
[25-Jan-2013 02:48:57]  <IllFlower> in any case, Yuna (eventually) manages to get the attention of a passing taxi.
[25-Jan-2013 02:50:22]  <phonicalica> 14 who's shirakawa?
[25-Jan-2013 02:50:28]  <IllFlower> after a short trip, one that mostly consists of waiting at traffic lights, the pair arrive at a nearby hospital.

[25-Jan-2013 02:51:03]  <IllFlower> the hospital building itself seems taller than any of the towers back home in Kikugawa, to say nothing of the buildings that surround it.
[25-Jan-2013 02:51:09]  <Yuna> ((like Alan Greenspan or such))
[25-Jan-2013 02:51:29]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun waltzes in through the front door and makes a beeline for the doors to the patient rooms. **
[25-Jan-2013 02:52:00]  * Yuna dashes behind pyunpyun, mainly just worried she'd fall behind

[25-Jan-2013 02:53:20]  <IllFlower> he crawls up the wall and hits the call button for a elevator close by. **

[25-Jan-2013 03:00:02]  <IllFlower> it seems like Pyunpyun is somehow physiologically incapable of just standing upright in an elevator like everyone else...

[25-Jan-2013 03:07:00]  <Yuna> seeee!  you shouldn't be climbing on the ceiling like that!
[25-Jan-2013 03:08:17]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun hops out of Yuna's arms and starts walking down the hospital corridors. "follow me," he says.
[25-Jan-2013 03:08:52]  <IllFlower> a nearby bulletin board is pinned full of children's drawings of various animals: butterflies, horses, dinosaurs.
[25-Jan-2013 03:09:37]  <IllFlower> doctors and nurses walk down the hallways, wheeling various kinds of medical equipment to and fro.
[25-Jan-2013 03:09:47]  * Yuna steps around quietly, hoping not to disturb anyone
[25-Jan-2013 03:10:33]  <IllFlower> one nurse, passing by, chats with a male patient about manga. it seems they know each other fairly well.
[25-Jan-2013 03:11:02]  <IllFlower> as usual, none of them seem to notice Pyunpyun or Yuna, even despite the latter's rather amusing play at stealth.

[25-Jan-2013 03:12:51]  <Yuna> So that's her...

I read the evening edition last night, and the police said they still hadn't found any connection, but we all know that's total garbage. Shinagawa and Itou, the first two? they were best friends. now Irie's gone. Irie was dating Shinagawa. doesn't get any more connected than that."
