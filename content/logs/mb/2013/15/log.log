[20-Mar-2013 01:42:31]  <IllFlower> Picking up where we left off last episode (remember last episode? man, that's some nostalgia), Yui and Yuna are headed over to Aoi's place, trying to recruit a fellow initiate for some witch-smashing.
[20-Mar-2013 01:43:15]  <IllFlower> It's dark, but cloudless, and the stars shine on this Monday evening with a vividly surreal intensity.
[20-Mar-2013 01:43:24]  <IllFlower> Small talk, go. **
[20-Mar-2013 01:43:31]  *** Barcode <~Barcode@dhcp-0-18-e7-f8-27-1.cpe.sourcecable.net> has left #madokamadness
[20-Mar-2013 01:45:00]  <Sumire> 14i think that means you, Yui and Yuna
[20-Mar-2013 01:45:14]  <Yui> (no shit, sherlock)
[20-Mar-2013 01:46:08]  <Yuna> ((um... yui start me off here >_<))
[20-Mar-2013 01:46:41]  <Yui> It's nice to have a clear night, huh Yuna? I can never find constellations without a chart though. 
[20-Mar-2013 01:48:34]  <Yuna> "Y-yeah... all those... all those bright lights..."
[20-Mar-2013 01:48:44]  * Yuna glances over at her purse for a moment, shaking her head
[20-Mar-2013 01:49:07]  <Yui> Hey, now, we'll get it back. It'll be okay.
[20-Mar-2013 01:49:13]  * Yui grabs Yuna's hand
[20-Mar-2013 01:50:27]  * Yuna follows along a bit meekly
[20-Mar-2013 01:50:59]  <Yuna> "I hope he can help... I'm such an idiot for getting us into a mess like this..."
[20-Mar-2013 01:51:12]  <Sumire> 14sorry, he has his own episode
[20-Mar-2013 01:51:23]  <Yui> We're all idiots sometimes, Yuna, that's why we have friends
[20-Mar-2013 01:51:31]  <Yui> they help us cover our idiocy tracks
[20-Mar-2013 01:52:20]  <IllFlower> Yui, counting off the surrounding buildings, spots their destination in an unassuming cluster of low-rise flats. **
[20-Mar-2013 01:53:44]  <Yui> Hey, there we go! Your destination is ahead on the left. I mean right. Wait, which one is which again?
[20-Mar-2013 01:54:08]  <IllFlower> Yui: Basically Mayoi.
[20-Mar-2013 01:54:14]  <Sumire> 14you have arrived at your destination
[20-Mar-2013 01:54:20]  <Yuna> "U-um... I thought you knew..."
[20-Mar-2013 01:55:07]  <Yui> I do know, I just don't know which arbitrary name to give the side it's on
[20-Mar-2013 01:55:12]  <Sumire> 14@g mayoi
[20-Mar-2013 01:55:12]  <Omnipresence> 14Sumire: Google: (1/4) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayoi_Neko_Overrun! — Mayoi Neko Overrun! - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: Mayoi Neko Overrun! (迷い猫オーバーラン!, Mayoi Neko Ōbāran!, Stray Cat Overrun!) is a Japanese light novel series (+797 more characters)
[20-Mar-2013 01:55:49]  <IllFlower> Yuna might have to give Yui a little lecture on the difference between left and right...
[20-Mar-2013 01:55:49]  <Nitya> 14yes precisely
[20-Mar-2013 01:55:55]  <IllFlower> No, just kidding.
[20-Mar-2013 01:56:17]  <Sumire> 14Yui has fingers and can use them to point
[20-Mar-2013 01:56:38]  <IllFlower> "Who has two thumbs and can't tell directions to save her life? This girl!"
[20-Mar-2013 01:57:09]  <Yui> s'right there. C'mon, Yuna.
[20-Mar-2013 01:57:22]  <IllFlower> Anyway, Yui, her slight directional impairment aside, manages to pick a building -- who knows if it's the right one, but at least she picked one -- and start on her way up the stairwell.
[20-Mar-2013 01:58:18]  <IllFlower> The stairs aren't particularly well lit, thanks to a burned-out bulb or two, lending the concrete-walled flights a claustrophobic air.
[20-Mar-2013 01:58:47]  <Yuna> "I-I don't really like this place..."
[20-Mar-2013 01:58:50]  <IllFlower> Aoi's apartment is on the top floor, so it looks like there's some hoofing to be done. **
[20-Mar-2013 01:58:56]  * Yuna reflexively reaches for her flashlight only to find it not there.
[20-Mar-2013 01:59:02]  <Sumire> 14surprise!  thanks to Yui's terribad sense of direction, she's now at Sumire's apartment
[20-Mar-2013 02:00:37]  <Yui> It is kinda spooky, but the sooner we get up the stairs, the sooner we can accost Aoi
[20-Mar-2013 02:01:27]  * Yuna nods and trails behind Yui 
[20-Mar-2013 02:01:44]  <Yui> ((achievement unlocked, my dad had to go get his guitar to check my piano notation))
[20-Mar-2013 02:02:29]  <IllFlower> Halfway up the stairs, on a particularly poorly lit landing, Yui runs into someone in the darkness.
[20-Mar-2013 02:03:24]  <IllFlower> A few loud screams are had all around before she realizes that only one person, anywhere, could have such a shock of pink hair. **
[20-Mar-2013 02:03:36]  <Sumire> 14pffffff
[20-Mar-2013 02:04:55]  <Sumire> "Oh, oh my gosh, I'm so sorry...is that you, Yui?"
[20-Mar-2013 02:05:19]  * Yuna turns her head up slightly, looking dead pale, as if she saw a ghost
[20-Mar-2013 02:05:31]  <Yuna> S-sumi---sum----s-urmie.... it's.... it's you...
[20-Mar-2013 02:05:46]  <Yui> That... yes, that would have been me.
[20-Mar-2013 02:05:48]  * Yuna shuffles back down the stairs as she mutters
[20-Mar-2013 02:05:54]  <Yui> Yuna?
[20-Mar-2013 02:06:18]  <Yui> I'm okay, Sumire, did you survive impending doom?
[20-Mar-2013 02:07:15]  <Sumire> "I...think so?  After the past few days I can't be sure of anything anymore.  Aoi's not home, though."
[20-Mar-2013 02:07:47]  <Yui> Damn.
[20-Mar-2013 02:07:50]  <Yui> I mean darn.
[20-Mar-2013 02:08:05]  <Yui> Darn, darn is definitely what I meant
[20-Mar-2013 02:08:08]  <Yui> mending socks
[20-Mar-2013 02:08:19]  <Sumire> 14Yui, I don't think this pun works in Japanese.
[20-Mar-2013 02:08:37]  <Yui> but after the past few days? Does that have to do with whatever Yuna was upset about?
[20-Mar-2013 02:08:45]  <IllFlower> One assumes it was localized for the English release.
[20-Mar-2013 02:08:46]  <Sumire> Yeah.  Did I scare Yuna?  I think I pissed her off earlier...she threw away her flashlight.
[20-Mar-2013 02:09:40]  * Yuna shrinks behind a pillar on the staircase and tries to act like she doesn't exist
[20-Mar-2013 02:09:51]  <Yui> I think you're pretty much the last person she wants to talk to for whatever reason, which clearly means we must retrieve my best friend and figure out what's going on.
[20-Mar-2013 02:10:34]  <Sumire> As for the last few days, it's a long story, so I think we should probably go somewhere other than these rather uncomfortable stairs.
[20-Mar-2013 02:10:50]  <Yui> Got any suggestions?
[20-Mar-2013 02:11:29]  <IllFlower> It looks like there's a small playground with benches ringing it not far from the apartment building...
[20-Mar-2013 02:11:55]  * Sumire points to the playground.  "Those benches over there seem suitable."
[20-Mar-2013 02:12:41]  <Yui> okay, you start over there, I'll try to convince Yuna that talking is an acceptable practice.
[20-Mar-2013 02:13:25]  <Sumire> "Thank you.  Tell her I apologize for being so rude to her last Thursday."
[20-Mar-2013 02:13:37]  <Yui> Will do.
[20-Mar-2013 02:15:10]  * Yui pads down to the other side of the pillar from Yuna and whispers "hey you, invisible one, permission to come aboard the good ship Hiding from the World?"
[20-Mar-2013 02:16:00]  <Yuna> "I... I....     I'm.... I don't understand... sorry..."
[20-Mar-2013 02:16:24]  <Yui> I am respecting your hideyhole
[20-Mar-2013 02:16:45]  * Sumire makes her way down the stairs as Yuna and Yui discuss
[20-Mar-2013 02:17:37]  <Yui> You clearly don't want to talk to Sumire, but if Aoi isn't home, she's the only other one who can help you. Also she said to tell you she was sorry for being so rude to you last Thursday"
[20-Mar-2013 02:17:53]  <Yuna> "N-no... it's... it's just..."
[20-Mar-2013 02:18:02]  <Yuna> "I never said... I don't want to talk with her..."
[20-Mar-2013 02:18:25]  <Yui> Sorry for assuming things about your retreat.
[20-Mar-2013 02:18:32]  <Yuna> "Sorry... I'm... still kind of not really... "
[20-Mar-2013 02:18:49]  <Yuna> "Um... could I just... follow behind you at least... if that's okay...?
[20-Mar-2013 02:19:11]  <Yui> that's fine, I guess
[20-Mar-2013 02:19:24]  <Yui> c'mon then, we're headed over to that playground.
[20-Mar-2013 02:19:26]  * Yuna cautiously steps out
[20-Mar-2013 02:22:02]  <Sumire> 14are the initiates at the playground now?
[20-Mar-2013 02:22:12]  <Yui> should be
[20-Mar-2013 02:24:03]  <IllFlower> Sumire's already found a comfortable spot on a nearby bench, it looks like.
[20-Mar-2013 02:25:44]  <Yui> Hey Sumire. So as you know, Yuna doesn't have her flashlight. Did you see the news earlier?
[20-Mar-2013 02:26:11]  <Sumire> "No, I haven't seen anything on the news.  I picked it up after she threw it down, so it should be in my closet.  Why, is it in the news?"
[20-Mar-2013 02:26:51]  <IllFlower> Wait, I thought we retconned that part. >_>
[20-Mar-2013 02:27:07]  <Sumire> 14oh, did we?  I thought you said it disappeared.  Whoooooops
[20-Mar-2013 02:27:24]  <Sumire> 14If we did retcon, replace my line with a simpler no, I guess.
[20-Mar-2013 02:27:29]  <Yui> ((gj A+ consistency))
[20-Mar-2013 02:27:33]  * IllFlower raises clapboard
[20-Mar-2013 02:27:41]  <IllFlower> Take two, and... action!
[20-Mar-2013 02:28:36]  <Yui> Well, after she threw it, we're not sure how, but a witch got a hold of it. Police intervened before anybody got hurt
[20-Mar-2013 02:28:43]  <Yui> but we need to get that flashlight back
[20-Mar-2013 02:29:01]  <Sumire> "A witch?  That's bad.  We do indeed need to get it back."
[20-Mar-2013 02:29:16]  <Yui> and I'm forbidden from using magic because I got a creepy postcard of Snezana from a secret admirer. That's why we were coming to see Aoi.
[20-Mar-2013 02:29:45]  <Yui> Not because I got a postcard, but because I can't fight this fight
[20-Mar-2013 02:30:02]  <Yui> but he could, and if you were willing, I suppose you could as well\
[20-Mar-2013 02:30:31]  <Sumire> "I'd definitely be willing, considering that I'm probably at fault for what happened.  And maybe what happened to Aoi, too."
[20-Mar-2013 02:30:54]  <Yui> Wait, something happened to Aoi?
[20-Mar-2013 02:31:12]  * Yuna mutters.  "It's... it's not... your fault..." but her whisper is drowned out in the sounds of the city.
[20-Mar-2013 02:31:35]  <IllFlower> Sumire and Yuna do need to make up in some capacity (i.e., a Bond) to simultaneously participate in the inevitable witch fight. Just a reminder.
[20-Mar-2013 02:31:35]  <Sumire> "Well, he wasn't at school today, and last Thursday, ..." Sumire recaps the meeting with Kaede.
[20-Mar-2013 02:32:00]  <Yui> oh.... dear. That is... not good.
[20-Mar-2013 02:34:46]  <Sumire> "I still wonder what could have caused all this weirdness, assuming it's not Pyunpyun and Kaede playing a sick joke on me."
[20-Mar-2013 02:35:44]  <IllFlower> Sumire hears a voice calling out to her: "I heard that!"
[20-Mar-2013 02:35:50]  <IllFlower> Or maybe it was just her imagination... **
[20-Mar-2013 02:36:31]  <Yui> ((wow nemo is a meaniehead))
[20-Mar-2013 02:36:35]  <Sumire> "Did you guys hear something?  I think I heard a voice in my direction."
[20-Mar-2013 02:37:02]  <IllFlower> Hey, sometimes we need comic relief.
[20-Mar-2013 02:37:12]  <Yui> I don't think I heard anything, sorry
[20-Mar-2013 02:37:51]  <Yui> ((SUDDEN REALIZATION THAT THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW IS THURSDAY))
[20-Mar-2013 02:38:32]  <Yui> So, Sumire, Yuna, we're all in agreement that we need to go get the flashlight, right? Anybody have homework objections??
[20-Mar-2013 02:38:50]  <Sumire> "Nah, the only homework I have left is the stuff I'm pretty sure the teacher doesn't even actually understand."
[20-Mar-2013 02:39:53]  * Yuna puts her head in her hands and sobs a little, shaking her head.
[20-Mar-2013 02:40:48]  * Yui kneels down in front of Yuna, placing her hands on Yuna's
[20-Mar-2013 02:41:09]  * Sumire also kneels down in front of Yuna.  "Is there anything I can do?"
[20-Mar-2013 02:41:30]  <Yuna> "Y-you... you don't need to... I'm the one at fault for this mess...."
[20-Mar-2013 02:43:47]  <Sumire> "Hey now, I was the one that brought you over to that stupid place for my answers.  It's only fair that I help you get it back."

[20-Mar-2013 02:47:14]  <Yuna> "Dude... dude with... with the hair...?"
[20-Mar-2013 02:47:50]  <Sumire> "The one with Kaede who was hassling me about her.  Cota, maybe?"
[20-Mar-2013 02:48:04]  <Yuna> I.... I don't... I don't really... remember...
[20-Mar-2013 02:48:36]  <Sumire> "Whatever.  It's not really relevant."
[20-Mar-2013 02:49:31]  <Yuna> "I don't really... I... my head's kind of spinning...
[20-Mar-2013 02:53:11]  <Sumire> "Don't worry.  We'll find a way to get that flashlight back.  Even if I am the worst at actually finding those stupid witches."
[20-Mar-2013 02:54:05]  <Yuna> "You'll really do that... for me...?"

[20-Mar-2013 02:55:34]  <Sumire> "Of course I will." 14in case it isn't completely obvious I'm hitting for something I can do a Bond move on
[20-Mar-2013 02:56:08]  <Yuna> ((I have no idea what that means))
[20-Mar-2013 02:56:27]  <Yuna> "Even after I just... failed so uselessly... when you needed me most?"
[20-Mar-2013 02:56:39]  <Yui> ((it's a prompt for Illflower, I think))
[20-Mar-2013 02:57:07]  <IllFlower> Just needs to be a significant positive interaction, as per the rules.
[20-Mar-2013 02:57:12]  <Sumire> "You didn't fail.  Kaede was just a brick wall against making sense."
[20-Mar-2013 02:57:27]  <IllFlower> I'm looking for something that'll put Yuna and Sumire back on speaking terms, even the most tenuous thereof.
[20-Mar-2013 02:58:59]  <Yuna> ((I'm trying to get there too)
[20-Mar-2013 02:59:04]  <Yuna> ((it's just not that easy))
[20-Mar-2013 02:59:14]  <Yuna> ((I need to defeat Yuna's feelings first))
[20-Mar-2013 02:59:42]  <Yuna> "I... I... just..."

[20-Mar-2013 03:00:47]  * Sumire returns the hug.  "Y...you're welcome."
[20-Mar-2013 03:01:30]  <IllFlower> <feepbot> Awwwww!

[20-Mar-2013 03:02:08]  <Sumire> 14there wasn't a heart in that though, IllFlowie
[20-Mar-2013 03:02:44]  <Yuna> "I-I... I don't know much use I can be right now but... I think we should... let's go get that witch!"
[20-Mar-2013 03:03:39]  <Sumire> "The obvious answer is that I have broken witchradar, you can help with that."
[20-Mar-2013 03:03:43]  <Sumire> 14Bond roll?
[20-Mar-2013 03:04:25]  <IllFlower> Yeah, sure, go ahead. 2d6+So, 12 or above.

[20-Mar-2013 03:05:28]  <Sumire> 14pffffffffff
[20-Mar-2013 03:05:38]  <Sumire> 14Sumire's totally putting the Bond moves on Yuna, yeah, that would totally happen
[20-Mar-2013 03:05:42]  <IllFlower> Congratulations. You're now able to talk to each other. ._.
[20-Mar-2013 03:05:56]  <SpruceZeus> ((And then Yuna crashed in through the skylight, killed a dozen men, and stole top secret encrypted data))

[20-Mar-2013 03:08:13]  <Sumire> 14and then IllFlower will hand me some debt from the US Treasury
[20-Mar-2013 03:08:24]  <IllFlower> ...
[20-Mar-2013 03:08:33]  <IllFlower> On with it, man.
[20-Mar-2013 03:08:59]  <Sumire> "So...now what?  How do we actually find the witch?"
[20-Mar-2013 03:10:51]  <Yui> well, there was the building mentioned in the report, maybe that would be a good start. Y'know, if it's not still a crime scene
[20-Mar-2013 03:11:07]  <Sumire> "Hmm, yeah.  I assume you know where that is?"
[20-Mar-2013 03:11:17]  <IllFlower> The lack of concern for Aoi here is staggering, although given that he missed out on the last boss witch... well...
[20-Mar-2013 03:12:22]  <Yuna> "Um... maybe we shoud go try to get my flashlight...?"
[20-Mar-2013 03:12:23]  <Sumire> 14sorry, Yuna and I just got into bonding over fighting the witch.

[20-Mar-2013 03:22:33]  <Sumire> 14but really, IllFlower, are you trying to hint us back to Aoi's apartment?
[20-Mar-2013 03:22:48]  <IllFlower> Oh, no. I was just making a joke.
[20-Mar-2013 03:23:11]  <IllFlower> I need to stop doing that with my authoritative GM voice.
[20-Mar-2013 03:23:41]  <IllFlower> You guys decide on a plan of action...
[20-Mar-2013 03:24:49]  <Sumire> "So Yui, you said you know where the building is that all this happened at, right?"

[20-Mar-2013 03:35:24]  <Sumire> 14yeah, I don't know if IllFlower wants us to do that.  I think it might be GM railroad time
[20-Mar-2013 03:36:29]  <IllFlower> Oh, my remaining plan essentially goes "have characters strike witch-fighting pose, cliffhang, call it a day."
[20-Mar-2013 03:36:42]  <IllFlower> So sound determined or at least willing to fight or something. :p
[20-Mar-2013 03:37:02]  <Sumire> 14oh.  well, I think the witch-fighting pose actually came after the bonding move.
[20-Mar-2013 03:37:30]  <Sumire> "Hmm.  Well, either way, I'm sure we'll think of something.  One way or another we'll get that flashlight back."
