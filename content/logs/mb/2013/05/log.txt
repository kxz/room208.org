[23-Jan-2013 02:02:46]  <IllFlower> okay, let's get this show on the road.
[23-Jan-2013 02:02:47]  <Barcode> KACHUNK
[23-Jan-2013 02:02:55]  *** Barcode is now known as Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]
[23-Jan-2013 02:03:27]  <IllFlower> Aoi, Miaka, and Yui are standing in the middle of a witch's maze, one that resembles a large cave.
[23-Jan-2013 02:03:30]  *** CentralAve <~CentralAv@cpe-24-208-145-101.insight.res.rr.com> has left #madokamadness
[23-Jan-2013 02:03:43]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((How dark?))
[23-Jan-2013 02:04:34]  <IllFlower> the walls are covered with something that resembles fluorescent algae, but that writhes in a way that makes it look as if a multitude of arms emerge from its surface and are just as soon devoured back in.
[23-Jan-2013 02:05:04]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "Damn well don't want to touch that stuff..."
[23-Jan-2013 02:05:16]  <IllFlower> in the center is a large creature standing on a stone emerging from the water that covers the cave floor.
[23-Jan-2013 02:05:28]  <Yui> ((dude, scannerfodder **)
[23-Jan-2013 02:05:33]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((shit. fuck. yeah.))
[23-Jan-2013 02:05:44]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((disregard))
[23-Jan-2013 02:05:45]  <Aoi> 14"Damn well don't want to touch that guy."
[23-Jan-2013 02:05:50]  <IllFlower> its only distinguishing feature, aside from its violently purple color, is a gigantic maw that covers most of its... front.
[23-Jan-2013 02:06:36]  <IllFlower> inside the maw hangs what is distinguishably Namie Itou's body, a line of needles running from her head to between her legs, like a long zipper bisecting her vertically.
[23-Jan-2013 02:06:39]  <IllFlower> **
[23-Jan-2013 02:06:56]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((jesus.))
[23-Jan-2013 02:07:22]  <IllFlower> hey, at least I'm not making you roll a Stay Calm check yet.
[23-Jan-2013 02:07:37]  <Yui> ((which is pretty surprising))
[23-Jan-2013 02:07:57]  <IllFlower> what, you guys want to roll one? :D
[23-Jan-2013 02:07:59]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> Miaka seems reluctant to act. "Itou...what should we do?" She whispers to the others.
[23-Jan-2013 02:08:17]  <Aoi> "What, what, what, what..."
[23-Jan-2013 02:08:28]  <Aoi> 14What happens if we fail a cool check, i forget
[23-Jan-2013 02:08:41]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((roll for failed fear from the DH tables))
[23-Jan-2013 02:08:42]  <Aoi> 14(an Unnatural and Violence notch preceded by retching)
[23-Jan-2013 02:09:05]  <IllFlower> one of 1 pt OC, losing d6 Rs, trying to run, doing something humiliating, or relationship Strain
[23-Jan-2013 02:09:12]  <IllFlower> if you do particularly badly, two of those effects
[23-Jan-2013 02:09:23]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((these needles are like the ones from before, right?))
[23-Jan-2013 02:09:24]  <Yui> "Not panicking seems like a pretty good plan, considering last time, I don't think recovering the bodies is an option. Even if they are classmates, Miaka."
[23-Jan-2013 02:10:03]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] seems to change from shock to misery to intense frustration in the matter of a few seconds.
[23-Jan-2013 02:10:26]  <Aoi> 14how do you make a cool check again
[23-Jan-2013 02:11:17]  <IllFlower> ah, what the heck. everyone roll to stay calm. 2d6+Co. 15 is good, 12 is bad, anything below is worse.
[23-Jan-2013 02:11:37]  <buttercupistiny> +roll 2d6+3
[23-Jan-2013 02:11:37]  <rollermine> buttercupistiny: (5+4)+3=12
[23-Jan-2013 02:11:41]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> +roll 2d6+5
[23-Jan-2013 02:11:41]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: (5+5)+5=15

[23-Jan-2013 02:11:44]  <rollermine> Aoi: (6+4)+6=16
[23-Jan-2013 02:11:53]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((well this is going to be thematically abrupt
[23-Jan-2013 02:11:54]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ))
[23-Jan-2013 02:11:55]  <buttercupistiny> ((perfect))
[23-Jan-2013 02:11:57]  * Aoi catches his breath
[23-Jan-2013 02:12:20]  <buttercupistiny> ((I lied. NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO PANIC))
[23-Jan-2013 02:12:43]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> Miaka seems to make up her mind, focuses for a second. The Kruger's end shatters with the sound of groaning metal, and as if magnetized, swings over to her gauntlet hand, forming a larger, clawed glove.
[23-Jan-2013 02:12:54]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> the bits swing over to*
[23-Jan-2013 02:13:01]  <IllFlower> +roll d3
[23-Jan-2013 02:13:02]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 1=1
[23-Jan-2013 02:13:23]  <IllFlower> okay, Yui loses her cool and takes 1 Mg OC.
[23-Jan-2013 02:13:28]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "Well, I'm ready. Aoi? Yui?"
[23-Jan-2013 02:13:29]  <IllFlower> I'll leave it up to buttercupistiny how exactly...
[23-Jan-2013 02:14:12]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((if there's something shocking this thing is going to do maybe it should do it and then she makes her action))
[23-Jan-2013 02:14:33]  <IllFlower> no, it's just against the sight of Namie's body, presumably.
[23-Jan-2013 02:14:39]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((ah, okay.))
[23-Jan-2013 02:15:19]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((as usual I am listening to Fighting in Built Up Areas by Ladytron))
[23-Jan-2013 02:15:35]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((I really aught to get more of her? stuff))
[23-Jan-2013 02:15:37]  <Aoi> "Right... ready..."
[23-Jan-2013 02:15:52]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((can I roll for a bond 'ere))
[23-Jan-2013 02:15:58]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> bond attempt*
[23-Jan-2013 02:16:15]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: group. half female, so yeah
[23-Jan-2013 02:16:36]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((half....er. okay well, one second. mind a try at a Fury bond, Aoi?))
[23-Jan-2013 02:16:44]  <Yui> ((I don't know how one goes about responding to OC though @_@))
[23-Jan-2013 02:16:52]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: that only comes after you have a positive interaction
[23-Jan-2013 02:17:01]  <IllFlower> you can't just bond out of nowhere, unfortunately
[23-Jan-2013 02:17:08]  <Aoi> 14wouldn't it be Magic
[23-Jan-2013 02:17:11]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((Heh.didn't intend to, just...okay, lemme see))
[23-Jan-2013 02:17:22]  <IllFlower> Yui: okay, let me think of something.
[23-Jan-2013 02:18:37]  <Yui> ((just a heads up, Nemo, we're dealing with actual legitimate rl panic brain because my wheelchair fell apart on the way to school and while repaired and no harm done, nerves are frayed and I am frazzled and I'm sorry for incompetency))
[23-Jan-2013 02:18:46]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((aiee.))
[23-Jan-2013 02:18:47]  <IllFlower> as the three initiates approach the creature, Yui slips. "something's got my leg!" she screams, as she tumbles into the water. a beam of light escapes from her rolling pin, bouncing off the walls of the cave before glancing off the creature's head.
[23-Jan-2013 02:19:18]  <Yui> ((D: THAT WORKS))
[23-Jan-2013 02:19:20]  <IllFlower> needless to say, this grabs the mouth-being's attention, and it turns to face Yui and the other two...
[23-Jan-2013 02:19:37]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] decides to try to rouse the group. "Hhhhhere's an idea...why don't we have a little competition? We owe lunch to whoever lands the killing blow."  ((jesus christ this was a terrible attempt))
[23-Jan-2013 02:19:53]  <Aoi> 14excellent timing
[23-Jan-2013 02:20:08]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((as you can tell by claw hand, miaka is ready to rip and tear))
[23-Jan-2013 02:20:20]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((is this creature bipedal, or))
[23-Jan-2013 02:20:25]  <Aoi> 14I'm Water element, can I try and do something magicky
[23-Jan-2013 02:20:30]  <IllFlower> Namie's body continues to hang lifelessly in the creature's mouth, her deadened expression looking as if she's averting her eyes from what's sure to follow.
[23-Jan-2013 02:20:40]  <IllFlower> battle begins... now. pick your attribute.
[23-Jan-2013 02:20:58]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> Fury on Attack. Magic on Defense. Heart on Support.
[23-Jan-2013 02:21:04]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> 8, 6, 4.
[23-Jan-2013 02:21:09]  <IllFlower> Aoi: you can try and perform a Sorcery as on p. 15. make a Support challenge. 14 succeeds, 17 extra-succeeds.
[23-Jan-2013 02:22:37]  <Yui> ((A:Heart:8 D:Magic-6 (+1 OC) S:Fury-4 I'm still in even though something has my leg, yeah?))
[23-Jan-2013 02:22:56]  <Aoi> 14At 8 Mag, Sup 6 Fur, Def 4 Ht.  I'll try to make the water ddrain by flinging it as a wave at monstroboy.
[23-Jan-2013 02:23:11]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((oh shit, is this a pinkie demon))
[23-Jan-2013 02:23:12]  <IllFlower> nothing's actually got Yui's leg. it was just momentary panic as she fell.
[23-Jan-2013 02:23:22]  <Aoi> +roll 2d6+6
[23-Jan-2013 02:23:22]  <rollermine> Aoi: (2+6)+6=14
[23-Jan-2013 02:23:26]  <Yui> ((ohhhhh))
[23-Jan-2013 02:23:54]  <IllFlower> Aoi: that sounds like something you could do as an attack.
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:09]  <Aoi> ...ok, can i do that then
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:12]  <IllFlower> sure.
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:18]  <Aoi> +roll 2d6+8
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:18]  <rollermine> Aoi: (5+4)+8=17
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:21]  <IllFlower> hold on a sec
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:25]  <IllFlower> I need to determine initiative
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:41]  <IllFlower> since you're all *exactly* tied `_`
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:44]  <Aoi> 14great, while you do that, i will go off and be somewhere else.
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:47]  <Aoi> 14BYE FRIENDS
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:49]  <IllFlower> +decide a|y|w|m
[23-Jan-2013 02:24:49]  <rollermine> IllFlower: a

[23-Jan-2013 02:24:53]  <rollermine> IllFlower: m|y|w|a
[23-Jan-2013 02:25:02]  <IllFlower> oh, what luck. Aoi's last.
[23-Jan-2013 02:25:11]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode], up.
[23-Jan-2013 02:26:10]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] tries her absolute hardest to set aside her consternation of swinging at something holding even a dead human being within itself, and charges the monster, snubgun-arm forward while she reels up a swipe with the gauntlet.
[23-Jan-2013 02:26:16]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> +roll 2m6+8
[23-Jan-2013 02:26:16]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: (5+2)+8=15

[23-Jan-2013 02:26:46]  <IllFlower> success. roll d6+4 for damage.
[23-Jan-2013 02:26:50]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> +roll d6+4
[23-Jan-2013 02:26:51]  <rollermine> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: 4+4=8
[23-Jan-2013 02:27:18]  <IllFlower> 8 damage. describe, and we'll move on to Yui.
[23-Jan-2013 02:27:50]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] swings her left arm back and her right arm forward, slashing the thing across the head. Sliding to a stop behind it, she turns and bashes it over the head with the Kruger.
[23-Jan-2013 02:27:51]  <IllFlower> ... oh, dammit, I forgot Aoi has Swift Action, so technically he should go first. welp, too late now `_`
[23-Jan-2013 02:28:01]  <IllFlower> I'll just go in the order that we've already determined
[23-Jan-2013 02:28:12]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((Doesn't have have to use Swift Action for that to count, anyway?))
[23-Jan-2013 02:28:30]  <IllFlower> it's an intrinsic bonus.
[23-Jan-2013 02:28:31]  *** Jack|Hawken <~JackMacke@75-51-144-130.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net> has quit IRC (Quit: GO TO BED)
[23-Jan-2013 02:28:38]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((ah, crap. next turn, presumably.))
[23-Jan-2013 02:28:50]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((he have*))
[23-Jan-2013 02:29:34]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((song called Sad Girl comes on. nope))
[23-Jan-2013 02:29:36]  <IllFlower> the creature staggers backwards, as blood emerges from Namie's arm where the Kruger's slash cut across it.
[23-Jan-2013 02:29:47]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((bah))
[23-Jan-2013 02:30:07]  *** kingCrackers <~Lin_Chong@203.117.37.231> has joined #madokamadness
[23-Jan-2013 02:30:28]  <Yui> (("This chapter seeks to provide a foundation for judging whether Congress is fulfilling its democratic responsibilities by connecting the promise and the performance of democracy"))
[23-Jan-2013 02:30:31]  <IllFlower> this doesn't make sense, as Namie disappeared some time ago, but then again, the fact that her body isn't completely decomposed doesn't make much sense either.
[23-Jan-2013 02:31:05]  <IllFlower> Yui's up. what say her?
[23-Jan-2013 02:31:07]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] backs up a bit ((presumably as yui prepares to attack)) but notices the blood, her resolve wavering. "Wh..."
[23-Jan-2013 02:32:01]  <IllFlower> seems like as good a time as any for another Stay Calm check `_`
[23-Jan-2013 02:32:12]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((gr))
[23-Jan-2013 02:32:27]  <Yui> ((dunno about Yui but the Shannon says the promise of democracy will be the end of her uhh, attacking I guess or staying calm check works too))
[23-Jan-2013 02:32:39]  <IllFlower> just for Miaka, since she reacted.
[23-Jan-2013 02:32:49]  <Yui> (ah, gotcha)
[23-Jan-2013 02:32:52]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((devious. aight one second))
[23-Jan-2013 02:32:52]  <IllFlower> 2d6+Co.

[23-Jan-2013 02:33:27]  <IllFlower> you attacked with Fr, so 1 Fr OC.
[23-Jan-2013 02:33:35]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((? also, note to self next time - play a teenaged girl who has done a tour of duty in the UAC, Mars Teleportation Experiments Division))
[23-Jan-2013 02:33:42]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((ah. agh))

[23-Jan-2013 02:33:58]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((you wanna describe it or should I do somethin'? I got something in mind))
[23-Jan-2013 02:34:00]  <IllFlower> okay, Yui attacks?
[23-Jan-2013 02:34:19]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((or well, OC, I guess it doesn't have to have an actual visual effect))
[23-Jan-2013 02:35:01]  <Yui> ((if that's kosher, yeah. 2d6+8, yeah? or m? why are we using m right off the bat if it's for overcharge? so confused.))

[23-Jan-2013 02:35:26]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((aiee. yeah I Don't think you can passively attack, only passively defend))
[23-Jan-2013 02:35:55]  <IllFlower> Yui: if you're rolling against a magical attribute, you get 1 pt OC and an extra die for any 6, regardless of whether you want to voluntarily take OC.
[23-Jan-2013 02:36:09]  <IllFlower> +roll 2m6+6
[23-Jan-2013 02:36:09]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (1+3)+6=10

[23-Jan-2013 02:36:33]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((I need to be really fucking careful, if I get over like 4OC anywhere I become a witch cause I have no relationships here))
[23-Jan-2013 02:36:36]  <IllFlower> okay, attack succeeds, with 1 pt Ht OC. roll d6+4+2 for damage.
[23-Jan-2013 02:36:56]  <Yui> +roll 1d6+4+2
[23-Jan-2013 02:36:56]  <rollermine> Yui: (3)+4+2=9
[23-Jan-2013 02:38:14]  <IllFlower> cool, 9 damage. go ahead and describe it. witch is next.
[23-Jan-2013 02:39:40]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: you have relationships, they're on the chart `_`
[23-Jan-2013 02:39:47]  <Yui> Regaining some semblance of dignity, Yui pulls herself onto one knee and holding the end of her rolling pin in her right hand swings it in a small arc along the floor sending shadows dancing off it and along the water. Yui then pulls herself back up to standing.
[23-Jan-2013 02:40:02]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((er, shit. yeah they just wouldn't be immediately visible because none of the players are here (or it'd be miaka's parents). right))
[23-Jan-2013 02:40:10]  <Yui> ((I think he means with active players this session))
[23-Jan-2013 02:41:05]  <IllFlower> one of the shadows strikes the maw-being, cutting across its short, stubby legs. it buckles into the ground as a white liquid flows from its wounds, but seems to recover abnormally quickly...
[23-Jan-2013 02:42:05]  <IllFlower> the witch elects to attack Yui with a Binding Attack (long story short, can't move until you roll 2d6+Sh over 15)
[23-Jan-2013 02:42:19]  <Yui> (FUN)
[23-Jan-2013 02:42:33]  <IllFlower> (also forces using lowest attribute for defense, so you may want to defend more strenuously than usual!)

[23-Jan-2013 02:43:03]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((oh, she can't defend against the attack, or just against the attack's damage, or...?)
[23-Jan-2013 02:43:05]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> )
[23-Jan-2013 02:43:15]  <Yui> ((so close and yet so far))
[23-Jan-2013 02:43:19]  <IllFlower> (by which I mean, if you don't succeed, I would suggest maybe taking some extra help)
[23-Jan-2013 02:43:26]  <IllFlower> (hint, hint)
[23-Jan-2013 02:44:42]  <IllFlower> (in other words, you can take an extra die on that defense roll by taking 1 Def OC, which in your case is Mg)
[23-Jan-2013 02:45:08]  <Yui> (OH. Okay. I can do that. Yes. Good plan.)
[23-Jan-2013 02:45:28]  <Yui> +roll 1d6
[23-Jan-2013 02:45:28]  <rollermine> Yui: (4)=4
[23-Jan-2013 02:45:33]  <IllFlower> 18. attack fails.
[23-Jan-2013 02:45:58]  <Yui> (and there was much rejoicing.)

[23-Jan-2013 02:46:53]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> Miaka gets a brief premonition of blood pouring from her gauntlet hand, but shakes it out of her head violently. "I'm. Okay."
[23-Jan-2013 02:46:56]  <IllFlower> the witch attempts to swipe at Yui with a truncated arm, but misjudges its aim due to its injured legs.
[23-Jan-2013 02:47:16]  <Yui> ((aw :c poor injured witchy)
[23-Jan-2013 02:47:52]  <IllFlower> it stumbles, swinging around, the maw that holds Namie facing the initiates yet again. a small rivulet of blood runs down her left arm.

[23-Jan-2013 02:48:26]  <IllFlower> why don't we call a break now and wait for him to come back?
[23-Jan-2013 02:48:47]  <Yui> ((sounds like a plan to DEMOCRACY))
[23-Jan-2013 02:48:48]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((Doesn't have to be a long break, but sure. He's twenty minutes into...whatever that is. dinner, right?))

[23-Jan-2013 03:20:41]  <IllFlower> there's no way you can go before Aoi, though, so you can wait until he's done.
[23-Jan-2013 03:20:43]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((okay I'm putting fury in support, switching heart to attack.))

[23-Jan-2013 03:34:06]  <IllFlower> Yui attempts to come around for another attack, but the creature is on top of her before she knows it. it takes a wild swing at her, knocking her across the cave.

[23-Jan-2013 03:37:55]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> (())*
[23-Jan-2013 03:38:10]  <IllFlower> the witch picks up speed from its earlier attack against Yui, breaking into a run, and smashes straight into Miaka.
[23-Jan-2013 03:38:23]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: I don't care at this point, you guys could probably use some clairvoyance ;)
[23-Jan-2013 03:38:27]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((aight.))
[23-Jan-2013 03:38:53]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] tries to bring up the kruger in defense, flaring magical energy as she does so, but the defense is far too feeble. She catapults across the cave and bounces off the wall in a heap.
[23-Jan-2013 03:39:14]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] is up.
[23-Jan-2013 03:39:36]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((such a fuckin' stupid attribute to put on attack...I fucked this up for us...alirght, so like, can I add OC after you roll, or no?))
[23-Jan-2013 03:39:52]  <IllFlower> yeah.

[23-Jan-2013 03:40:39]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> I'm gonna attack.

[23-Jan-2013 03:41:01]  <IllFlower> okay, roll for the attack.
[23-Jan-2013 03:41:27]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] gets up, particularly roughed up by the attack. She looks legitimately afraid of her opponent, for once. She raises the Kruger, which glows pink.

[23-Jan-2013 03:42:28]  <IllFlower> cool. roll 2d6+2 for damage, then

[23-Jan-2013 03:43:02]  <IllFlower> that's the end of the round. any changes to attack attributes?
[23-Jan-2013 03:43:03]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> The Kruger spews what looks like shards of pink glass at the witch.
[23-Jan-2013 03:43:09]  <IllFlower> or any attributes, really?
[23-Jan-2013 03:43:18]  <Aoi> 14i... guess i'm good?

[23-Jan-2013 03:44:27]  <IllFlower> the shards lodge themselves in the witch's back. no risk of hitting Namie's body from this angle, at least.
[23-Jan-2013 03:44:38]  <IllFlower> buttercupistiny/Yui?
[23-Jan-2013 03:44:40]  <ponicalica> 14I'm just saying, glass shards are kinda my thing :P >:|

[23-Jan-2013 03:45:10]  <Yui> ((stayin where I am))
[23-Jan-2013 03:45:31]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> Magic attack, Fury defense, heart support.
[23-Jan-2013 03:45:32]  <IllFlower> a small collection of the shards explodes. the creature arches its back, sending forth a wail of pain.
[23-Jan-2013 03:46:03]  <IllFlower> (you know, just to complete the reference. :D)
[23-Jan-2013 03:46:15]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((:P consider that the overcharge part of the attack I guess))

[23-Jan-2013 03:47:02]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: oh, yes, thanks for noting that.
[23-Jan-2013 03:47:08]  <IllFlower> Miaka's at 9 now.
[23-Jan-2013 03:47:40]  <IllFlower> Aoi: sure. 1 pt Mg OC, but otherwise as normal.
[23-Jan-2013 03:47:58]  <Aoi> 14so uh... what do i roll
[23-Jan-2013 03:48:18]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((Finishing Attacks: Each magical girl has a Finishing Attack that she can use once an episode. Using it always puts one extra point of Overcharge on the associated attribute, but otherwise it works like a normal attack."))
[23-Jan-2013 03:48:22]  <IllFlower> Aoi: roll for a normal attack first. you can decide whether to do a finishing attack or not after we roll att/def.
[23-Jan-2013 03:48:26]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((I guess it's a regular attack + the special attribute))

[23-Jan-2013 03:52:09]  <IllFlower> your finisher deals an extra d6 damage and bypasses any magical shields or whatever.
[23-Jan-2013 03:52:20]  <Aoi> 14right, ok.  i'll do that.

[23-Jan-2013 03:54:47]  * Aoi draws back the bow, and in the instant he releases the arrow has already appeared in what passes for the thing's cerebrum.  Aoi draws the compound mechanism back again, and icy blue lines spread throughout its insides.  Another release...
[23-Jan-2013 03:54:52]  <Aoi> kkkgh

[23-Jan-2013 03:56:27]  <IllFlower> the witch screams in pain as ice covers its body, until it's fully enveloped and finally goes silent.

[23-Jan-2013 04:00:03]  <IllFlower> you don't have to resolve your Overcharge with Fallout right away, due to the rules change. none of you are at 6 in any attribute.

[23-Jan-2013 04:01:03]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: 1 per attribute per episode. you're in the clear.

[23-Jan-2013 04:02:53]  <IllFlower> I'd say none of you need to take Fallout now, but there's still some narrative after this, so perhaps you should hoof it out of the cave. :D
[23-Jan-2013 04:03:00]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((right, right.))
[23-Jan-2013 04:03:08]  * Aoi does that

[23-Jan-2013 04:04:08]  <IllFlower> as the initiates exit the cave, the barrier blinks out of existence behind them without much fanfare.

[23-Jan-2013 04:09:10]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> "Just...you saw the blood, right? Poor Namie's been missing for a week...who knows how long she's been dead...how does that even work? Why do they even...what are they even doing with them?"
[23-Jan-2013 04:10:04]  <Aoi> "Gross... "
[23-Jan-2013 04:10:35]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] blinks, shakes her head, continues. "And of /course/, when we find the others it's probably going to be the same damn thing! It isn't fair. These are people!"

[23-Jan-2013 04:12:45]  <Yui> My dad had a catchall answer for questions he couldn't answer, Miaka, and that answer was "to make little girls wonder." I don't have answers, beyond that it's doing it because it can, I guess. Beyond that, maybe the overgrown dustbunny knows something.
[23-Jan-2013 04:13:37]  <IllFlower> do you think you could summon him? ;)

[23-Jan-2013 04:17:52]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((I was kind of going for quiet and then alarmingly aggressive when it comes to witches. I just keep fucking up with actually paying attention to ends of GM messages >_<))
[23-Jan-2013 04:18:09]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun steps toward Miaka, meeting her gaze. "all you need to know is that I've been at this long enough to understand how dangerous this is.
[23-Jan-2013 04:18:41]  <IllFlower> "do you think I'd really subject you to such harm if there were any other choice? do you suspect me enough to think, perhaps, that I'm withholding something important from you?" **
[23-Jan-2013 04:19:55]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] had stopped as Pyunpyun met reasonable distance. She stands tight-lipped.
[23-Jan-2013 04:21:02]  <Aoi> "...I suppose it's not like you didn't warn us. Me."
[23-Jan-2013 04:21:16]  <IllFlower> "no, it isn't," Pyunpyun says, his eyes moving from Miaka, to Aoi, then to Yui.
[23-Jan-2013 04:22:19]  <IllFlower> "I don't want to see my initiates suffer, any more than any of you would want to see each other suffer. in the world of magic, though, there is often nothing I can do.
[23-Jan-2013 04:22:28]  <IllFlower> "it's a fact I have to accept." **
[23-Jan-2013 04:24:43]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] looks aside. "I...maybe I didn't really fully consider how dangerous it'd be. But...I think I'm willing to deal with that. It's seeing our classmates, helplessly picked off..." She looks up. "I just...I wish we could stop them, instead of just catching them in the aftermath."
[23-Jan-2013 04:25:01]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> stop the witches,*
[23-Jan-2013 04:25:17]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun turns around, his gaze fixed on the ground at his feet. his figure casts a long shadow against the parking lot.
[23-Jan-2013 04:26:53]  <IllFlower> "that is why you fight. you fight because you treasure what you still have. you can't stop what's already happened, but know that you can at least stop what might in the future.
[23-Jan-2013 04:27:55]  <IllFlower> "I should go. all of you have classmates, and friends, and families to look out for -- who are looking out for you. I suggest you rejoin them." **
[23-Jan-2013 04:27:55]  <Yui> "but fluffbucket, you inform us to keep us alive and fighting. Even if you don't necessarily want to see us suffer, the fact of the matter is that we will, and we do. And like you said, it's just something we have to accept. You could be giving us only the information we needed to know to stay alive, but if it would keep us from fighting, keeping that on the back burner. And none of us would necessarily be any the wiser. Even if we 
[23-Jan-2013 04:28:04]  <Yui> ((or not))
[23-Jan-2013 04:28:17]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((even if we - cutoff, also))
[23-Jan-2013 04:29:13]  <IllFlower> the sun seems to glow more brightly for a second, and Pyunpyun vanishes in the glare. **
[23-Jan-2013 04:29:24]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((egh.))
[23-Jan-2013 04:29:50]  <Yui> Well, Miaka, feeling any more confident to seize the day?
[23-Jan-2013 04:30:38]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] closes her eyes, reflecting. "It's...hard to accept what's probably happened to Kei and Haruka..."
[23-Jan-2013 04:32:24]  <Yui> Hard to accept, but like the furball said, we fight to keep the ones still around, y'know, around.
[23-Jan-2013 04:32:31]  <Aoi> "Nothing for it now...I guess..."
[23-Jan-2013 04:33:00]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] nods. "Aoi...yeah, maybe it's a trick...it doesn't make it easier. Accidentally hitting poor Namie made me wonder if there just might be a chance....but her expression...I guess I should know better."
[23-Jan-2013 04:34:10]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] shakes her head, looks up. "Let's go, I guess," she says resignedly.
[23-Jan-2013 04:34:25]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((also. wot about fallout))
[23-Jan-2013 04:34:26]  <Aoi> "...yeah."
[23-Jan-2013 04:34:40]  <IllFlower> Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]: you can take that whenever, as long as you're below 6.
[23-Jan-2013 04:34:48]  <IllFlower> once you hit 6 you have to take it before the episode's over.
[23-Jan-2013 04:35:04]  <Aoi> 14two magic fallout would be like, what, everybody in the classroom seeing their reflections in the windows turn to look at them?
[23-Jan-2013 04:35:09]  <IllFlower> in any case, I'm still not quite done.
[23-Jan-2013 04:35:21]  <IllFlower> no more battles, though.
[23-Jan-2013 04:35:24]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((right. I doubt you'll throw another witch at us at this hour, so...guess I'll clear now :P))
[23-Jan-2013 04:35:25]  <Aoi> 14or just a few people, to make it dismissable, i guess.
[23-Jan-2013 04:35:30]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((predictions'dd'dd))
[23-Jan-2013 04:36:03]  <IllFlower> Aoi: 3 Mg would be like that. 2 Mg would be more like... a cow suddenly appears in the schoolyard. plausible, but highly improbably.
[23-Jan-2013 04:36:10]  <IllFlower> improbable.
[23-Jan-2013 04:37:09]  <IllFlower> you don't have to take Fallout now in any case; you can remove 1 at the end of this episode, and then after the next episode you can do so again and go back to 0 OC (barring additional OC in between, of course)
[23-Jan-2013 04:37:48]  <ponicalica> 14or you can deliberately keep building it up in an attempt to become witch
[23-Jan-2013 04:37:49]  <Aoi> 14how about all the whiteboards in the building having gruesome graffiti on them before anyone comes in?
[23-Jan-2013 04:38:13]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((re~d graffiti?))
[23-Jan-2013 04:38:19]  <Yui> ((at any rate I have homework, dudes, let's keep this moving, please?))
[23-Jan-2013 04:38:39]  <IllFlower> anyway, the initiates turn to each other. Yui nods in silence. the three of them pick their school bags up from a little pile in the parking lot, and start the long walk to school.
[23-Jan-2013 04:39:04]  <IllFlower> Aoi: yeah, that's fine. I'm going to put that on hold for now, though.
[23-Jan-2013 04:39:11]  <Aoi> 14ok.  sorry.
[23-Jan-2013 04:39:58]  <IllFlower> as the initiates get closer to the school grounds, the number of students gets larger and larger, eventually becoming a flood near the school gates.
[23-Jan-2013 04:40:25]  <IllFlower> all the while, the bright conversation of their classmates seems to make a mockery of what's just happened to Namie.
[23-Jan-2013 04:41:47]  <IllFlower> Aoi, Miaka, and Yui change their shoes at the lockers, constantly glancing over their shoulders at each other, trying to keep an eye on each other.
[23-Jan-2013 04:42:22]  <IllFlower> as they finish up and prepare to go to their respective classrooms, a pained cry echoes down the ground floor hallway. **
[23-Jan-2013 04:42:35]  * Aoi shudders
[23-Jan-2013 04:43:02]  * Yui stiffens her shoulders
[23-Jan-2013 04:43:04]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] swings around to look down the hall.
[23-Jan-2013 04:43:56]  <IllFlower> everyone in earshot seems to have done the same, their gaze fixed on the source of the noise.
[23-Jan-2013 04:44:51]  <IllFlower> as the morning banter goes silent, the sound of a girl sobbing breaks through.
[23-Jan-2013 04:45:18]  <IllFlower> near the end of the hallway, a second-year student is collapsed against the wall, her face buried in her arms.

[23-Jan-2013 04:46:36]  <IllFlower> a classmate of hers is knelt over at her side, trying to reassure her, or at least get her attention -- "Akari, Akari" -- but it seems to be making no difference. **
[23-Jan-2013 04:48:03]  * Aoi looks at Yui and Miaka.  "Should we..."
[23-Jan-2013 04:48:07]  <Aoi> *...?
[23-Jan-2013 04:49:07]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] looks intently, straining to hear any additional conversation. "Let's...think we'll be able to hear them from here? Ergh, maybe not..." she takes an unsure step torward.
[23-Jan-2013 04:49:11]  <Yui> Seems prudent, yeah.
[23-Jan-2013 04:50:18]  * Aoi walks up to the two.  Assuming they're not already crowded?
[23-Jan-2013 04:50:45]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] trails (if not), suddenly mindful of the gazes of the other students.
[23-Jan-2013 04:51:05]  <IllFlower> no, everyone else seems to be keeping their distance, unsure of whether to intervene in a live demonstration of the bystander effect. **
[23-Jan-2013 04:51:57]  <Aoi> "Hey.  Um... do you need help...?  I could take you to the nurse, or something..."
[23-Jan-2013 04:52:05]  <Aoi> 14fuck you, well-known psychological phenomena
[23-Jan-2013 04:52:26]  <IllFlower> the girl trying to comfort Akari looks up at Aoi, her eyes doing all the speaking that her mouth ordinarily would.
[23-Jan-2013 04:53:09]  <IllFlower> she begins speaking: "do you know her? I tried to ask her what's happening, but I haven't been --"
[23-Jan-2013 04:54:07]  <IllFlower> at that moment, Akari interrupts, her voice still shaky and her words delivered through uneven breaths. "it's -- today's -- she would have turned seventeen today..."

[23-Jan-2013 04:55:00]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] looks pained.
[23-Jan-2013 04:55:17]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> , looks away.*
[23-Jan-2013 04:56:24]  * Aoi swallows
[23-Jan-2013 04:57:33]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((yo yui, you're the one with the people skills :P))
[23-Jan-2013 04:57:50]  <IllFlower> (I'm going to put some words in your mouth, Aoi. well, one word. just to keep this going.)
[23-Jan-2013 04:57:55]  <Yui> oh, right, sorry, pelosi)
[23-Jan-2013 04:58:26]  <Aoi> 14ok.
[23-Jan-2013 04:59:32]  <IllFlower> "whose?" Aoi asks. the question seems to lack any force of direction, as if Aoi had just used up all of his energy to push it from his mouth, having no choice but to let it then fall onto the ground.
[23-Jan-2013 05:00:05]  <IllFlower> Akari's friend utters a single syllable. "Kei's."
[23-Jan-2013 05:00:46]  <IllFlower> she looks up at Aoi, then down at the ground again.
[23-Jan-2013 05:01:27]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] gets fidgety, though she seems too exhausted to make anything of her distress.
[23-Jan-2013 05:01:37]  <IllFlower> Akari herself heaves a huge sob, as if there were no other way left for her to breathe, then continues in fragments.
[23-Jan-2013 05:01:46]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((er, shit. goddammit me))
[23-Jan-2013 05:01:55]  <IllFlower> is cool. I'm going to keep going for a bit.

[23-Jan-2013 05:03:58]  <IllFlower> "we -- I -- she... she'd been... distant for a little while. maybe... maybe a few months ago? I was wondering whether she still thought of me as a friend any more -- but..."
[23-Jan-2013 05:04:02]  <Nitya> ((Nothing.   This is phone. ))
[23-Jan-2013 05:05:31]  <IllFlower> Akari pauses. "then she called me one day, out of the blue, asking if I wanted to go to the local amusement park with her on her birthday...
[23-Jan-2013 05:06:27]  <IllFlower> "and I couldn't believe it was happening for -- for a moment, and I told her that much. then she says..." another pause.
[23-Jan-2013 05:07:35]  <IllFlower> "she says, like we're six years old" -- Akari forces a laugh -- "she says, 'if I'm lying, I'll swallow a thousand needles' in the brightest voice she has...
[23-Jan-2013 05:07:55]  <IllFlower> "... and then before I could talk to her again, they said she'd disappeared..."
[23-Jan-2013 05:08:33]  <IllFlower> Akari's words fade away into a softer crying. her friend continues to look away. **
[23-Jan-2013 05:09:40]  <Yui> ((looks at "swallow a thousand needles" stares at minestrone in horror))
[23-Jan-2013 05:09:57]  <Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode]> ((lol))
[23-Jan-2013 05:10:39]  <IllFlower> it's an old Japanese children's saying. 「嘘をついたら針千本飲ます」
[23-Jan-2013 05:11:42]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] notices the mention of needles. A mild raise of one eyebrow that fades back to her previous pallidness.
[23-Jan-2013 05:12:08]  <Yui> Yui edges closer to Miaka at the mention of needles, figuring she could use some support, considering Yui herself is feeling a bit off
[23-Jan-2013 05:14:05]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] notices Yui inch closer. Swallows. "Do...did anyone else see her before she disappeared...?" Miaka offers, almost immediately grimacing. The police probably have already asked her this.
[23-Jan-2013 05:15:17]  <IllFlower> Akari's gone. it doesn't look like any of Miaka's words have reached her. her friend shakes her head, her expression one of utter hopelessness.
[23-Jan-2013 05:15:23]  * Nitya breathes... "do you want to go to the infirmary for a bit?"
[23-Jan-2013 05:17:35]  <IllFlower> Akari doesn't respond, but when her friend leans down and pulls her up onto her shoulder, she offers no resistance.
[23-Jan-2013 05:18:15]  <IllFlower> the classmate slowly stands Akari up, herself on one side and Aoi on the other, and they head in the direction of the infirmary. **
[23-Jan-2013 05:20:51]  <IllFlower> okay, that's all I have for today, unless you guys want to keep playing through this scene.
[23-Jan-2013 05:21:01]  * Miaka_Watanabe_[Barcode] starts cursing under her breath, but gives way to just rubbing at her face with one hand. She's looking weaker than ever. ((nah I don't really have anything else to contribute))
