[22-Jun-2013 19:39:08]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's start where we left off last session.
[22-Jun-2013 19:39:28]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones, you mentioned that Snezana was looking for Pyunpyun, so we'll begin with that.
[22-Jun-2013 19:39:39]  <Snezana> roger
[22-Jun-2013 19:39:49]  *** Nitya is now known as Aoi
[22-Jun-2013 19:39:55]  <Aoi> 14still have no idea what's happening.
[22-Jun-2013 19:39:56]  <Snezana> ((Just as a side note, are there pay phones?))
[22-Jun-2013 19:40:22]  <IllFlower> She finds Pyunpyun curled up in his hideout, facing the window, staring out as if in deep thought about something.
[22-Jun-2013 19:40:23]  <buttercupistiny> ((aww yiss the one with the pants makes a return))
[22-Jun-2013 19:40:24]  <Snezana> ((and Nitya, do you know if Aoi has Yui's number?))
[22-Jun-2013 19:40:46]  <buttercupistiny> ((I think Aoi has Sumires))
[22-Jun-2013 19:40:48]  <IllFlower> Snezana: Who knows, there might be a stray phone in Pyunpyun's place.

[22-Jun-2013 19:41:03]  <IllFlower> Aoi: I'll introduce you a little later.
[22-Jun-2013 19:41:04]  * Snezana is carrying a chair as she enters the building
[22-Jun-2013 19:41:11]  <Aoi> 14Got it.
[22-Jun-2013 19:41:33]  * Snezana drops it and then sits, opening the front of her jacket to reveal a deep scar on her throat, she also takes out and unfolds the knife
[22-Jun-2013 19:41:57]  * Snezana looks down, contemplating where to begin
[22-Jun-2013 19:42:02]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun turns to look at Snezana, a quizzical look on his face. "Yukiko?" **
[22-Jun-2013 19:42:19]  <Snezana> "I think we can both drop this masquerade now, can't we?"
[22-Jun-2013 19:42:30]  * Snezana glares at pyun-pyun, resting the tip of the blade against her own throat
[22-Jun-2013 19:42:50]  <Snezana> "One thing I remember is that a ve-initiate, in her death throes is capable of absolutely
[22-Jun-2013 19:42:54]  <Snezana> stunning amounts of power
[22-Jun-2013 19:43:12]  <Snezana> Perhaps even enough to destroy a familiar
[22-Jun-2013 19:43:57]  <Snezana> But this is all hypothetical? I mean how many initiates really make go after another initiates
[22-Jun-2013 19:44:17]  <Snezana> How many initiates decide that their powers are a gift to get vengence on all that wronged them
[22-Jun-2013 19:44:45]  <Snezana> And how many initiates are backed against a corner with no way out
[22-Jun-2013 19:44:58]  <Snezana> and
[22-Jun-2013 19:45:01]  <Snezana> I-I apologize
[22-Jun-2013 19:45:03]  <Snezana> But I
[22-Jun-2013 19:45:07]  <IllFlower> "Hold on, hold on," Pyunpyun says, nonplussed.
[22-Jun-2013 19:45:15]  <IllFlower> He raises a paw to stop Snezana.
[22-Jun-2013 19:45:16]  <Aoi> 14I missed a lot, huh.
[22-Jun-2013 19:45:16]  * Snezana stands up, violently kicking the chair aside
[22-Jun-2013 19:45:27]  <Snezana> DONT LIKE THE WAY YOU ARE LOOKING AT ME
[22-Jun-2013 19:45:45]  * Snezana presses the knife against her throat, drawing faints amount of blood
[22-Jun-2013 19:46:06]  * Snezana begins to approach Pyun-pyun with her remaining arm outstretched, shaking heavily
[22-Jun-2013 19:46:16]  <IllFlower> Aoi: Yeah, looks like it.
[22-Jun-2013 19:46:55]  <Snezana> "I was told everything was over, no one would know me, no one would follow me. I was told-- a lot of lies from people like you
[22-Jun-2013 19:47:03]  <Snezana> people things, it doesn't fucking matter
[22-Jun-2013 19:47:33]  * Snezana raises her outstrehed arm, and snaps her finger, a sudden vaccumn forming around her. The air rushes in, creating a strong wind
[22-Jun-2013 19:47:59]  <ponicalica> 14 not even letting pyunpyun get a word in edgewise
[22-Jun-2013 19:48:05]  <buttercupistiny> (Aoi- you could try logs from last session search for squiggly if you want a crash course in backstory))
[22-Jun-2013 19:48:37]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun stands on the windowsill, the wind ruffling his coat. He seems to be waiting for something. **
[22-Jun-2013 19:48:49]  <Snezana> "I could bring down this building upon your head, I could encase you in a fucking cage and watch you slowly die, or I could tear you apart
[22-Jun-2013 19:49:05]  * Snezana puts the knife down, and places her other arm at her side
[22-Jun-2013 19:49:16]  <Snezana> "But we both know what would happen then, its mutually assured suicide."
[22-Jun-2013 19:49:19]  <Aoi> 14well i don't know if aoi is up on this or what.
[22-Jun-2013 19:49:29]  <Aoi> 14o welll, may as well take a gander.
[22-Jun-2013 19:49:38]  <Snezana> "Instead, why don't we talk. I'll let you start with the photograph
[22-Jun-2013 19:50:13]  <IllFlower> "I do like talking."
[22-Jun-2013 19:50:32]  <IllFlower> For someone whose life was just threatened, Pyunpyun seems remarkably nonchalant.
[22-Jun-2013 19:50:38]  <Snezana> "Then we're going to get along really well"
[22-Jun-2013 19:50:58]  <IllFlower> "I'd hate to get along poorly.
[22-Jun-2013 19:51:05]  <IllFlower> "So, what do you want to know?" **
[22-Jun-2013 19:51:09]  <Snezana> "You're messing with me aren't you?"
[22-Jun-2013 19:51:31]  <IllFlower> "You think I'm behind this." **
[22-Jun-2013 19:51:40]  <Snezana> "Why is Scorcher here. You should know why exactly I killed him."
[22-Jun-2013 19:52:34]  <Snezana> "I made pretty sure that he was dead, not even an 'omnipresent' master of death has to breathe, and I also know that its-- difficult-- to come back among the living if every tissue in your body has been torn apart
[22-Jun-2013 19:53:00]  <IllFlower> "Wait. Wait a second. I think you're jumping to conclusions.
[22-Jun-2013 19:53:05]  * Snezana twitches
[22-Jun-2013 19:53:31]  <Snezana> "THEN WHO ELSE COULD IT BE? HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD HAVE FIGURED IT OUT"
[22-Jun-2013 19:53:39]  * Snezana takes the knife and rests it against her scar
[22-Jun-2013 19:54:18]  <Snezana> "Over the past few days, I've been watched. Some sort of -- creature has been following me
[22-Jun-2013 19:54:34]  <IllFlower> "I think you give people too little credit. Can you hear me out?" He indicates the knife with a flick of her eye. **
[22-Jun-2013 19:54:42]  <Aoi> 14well, guess that log sort of explains that
[22-Jun-2013 19:54:54]  <Aoi> 14aoi doesn't know snezana so uh interesting introductioning coming??
[22-Jun-2013 19:55:08]  <Snezana> "Talk, then, I'm listening."
[22-Jun-2013 19:55:15]  <ponicalica> 14presumably one of the other initiates has talkeed at least briefly about her
[22-Jun-2013 19:55:53]  <Snezana> (("Hey see that weird foreign lady who keeps being cryptic?))
[22-Jun-2013 19:56:16]  <IllFlower> "You should know that the war you were involved in isn't exactly a secret."
[22-Jun-2013 19:56:59]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun thinks for a bit. "Plus, and I hate that this is the case, but you draw attention just by being an outsider.
[22-Jun-2013 19:57:45]  <IllFlower> "With or without basis, you might be singled out just for that.
[22-Jun-2013 19:57:50]  <ponicalica> 14I'm actually a bit confused wrt the timing of the war vs the timeline of the story
[22-Jun-2013 19:57:57]  <IllFlower> "It's clear you've drawn someone's attention. I'm not going to deny that.
[22-Jun-2013 19:58:15]  <Snezana> "Then how did that someone use a name that only comes from the old country?"
[22-Jun-2013 19:58:28]  <IllFlower> "What name?" **
[22-Jun-2013 19:58:41]  <IllFlower> (I'm actually not clear on that question either, haha)
[22-Jun-2013 19:59:01]  <Saladofstones> ((Yeah looking it up))
[22-Jun-2013 20:01:25]  <ponicalica> 14since the Bosnian war and such were the 90s but I think the story is present day, present time, lololololol
[22-Jun-2013 20:01:38]  * Saladofstones takes out a pocket-book, checking her notes
[22-Jun-2013 20:01:48]  <Saladofstones> "friendly stranger"
[22-Jun-2013 20:01:52]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: All I'm going by is that it happened at some point. Further details will only tie me in knots later down the line.
[22-Jun-2013 20:01:59]  <Saladofstones> Its a good translation of one of my nicknames 
[22-Jun-2013 20:02:17]  <Saladofstones> ((I Just assumed in this setting there is an ongoing war, fudging history a little bit))
[22-Jun-2013 20:02:40]  <ponicalica> 14well, that's plausible
[22-Jun-2013 20:03:03]  <Saladofstones> ((But if its up with Illflower if he wants time or age-fuckery going on"
[22-Jun-2013 20:03:06]  <Aoi> 14so uh, was aoi in trouble with pyunpyun too, or
[22-Jun-2013 20:03:22]  <ponicalica> 14I don't think so, since he's not connected to snezana
[22-Jun-2013 20:03:24]  <IllFlower> Aoi: Eh, no.
[22-Jun-2013 20:03:52]  <Saladofstones> "I was the 'friendly stranger'
[22-Jun-2013 20:04:00]  * Saladofstones laughs darkly at this
[22-Jun-2013 20:04:18]  <Saladofstones> whoops wrong character
[22-Jun-2013 20:04:43]  <Snezana> "A nice nickname for a killer, right?" 
[22-Jun-2013 20:05:26]  <IllFlower> Light flickers about in Pyunpyun's eyes as he thinks.
[22-Jun-2013 20:06:15]  <Snezana> "You don't seem as talkative as you used to be."
[22-Jun-2013 20:06:32]  * Snezana takes several steps closer to pyun-pyun, moving the palm of her hand to face pyun
[22-Jun-2013 20:06:45]  *** Aoi <~Glossina@174-25-59-69.ptld.qwest.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 194 seconds)
[22-Jun-2013 20:06:47]  <Snezana> "Time is short, I suggest you hurry up."
[22-Jun-2013 20:07:20]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun shakes his head. "This is news to me. I don't know as much as you think I do, Snezana.
[22-Jun-2013 20:07:49]  <IllFlower> "Still, the fact that someone seems to be out for you personally... I don't like it any more than you do." **
[22-Jun-2013 20:08:33]  <Snezana> "not knowing..."
[22-Jun-2013 20:08:36]  * Snezana reflects on this
[22-Jun-2013 20:08:59]  <Snezana> "I-I get it now, thats why you let Yui and Makoto go. If something happens to 
[22-Jun-2013 20:09:11]  <Snezana> them and they aren't under your custody, you don't need to know, is that right?

[22-Jun-2013 20:10:04]  <IllFlower> Disconnects, probably.
[22-Jun-2013 20:10:28]  <Aoi> 14yeap.

[22-Jun-2013 20:10:42]  <Snezana> "But I refuse to believe that a familiar isn't aware of people coming in. After all, I did my best to hide myself from you and we still met"
[22-Jun-2013 20:11:25]  <Snezana> "So lets assume that this person is local, I've met a fair amount of initiates and none of them to seem that-- capacity for being a hunter

[22-Jun-2013 20:17:36]  <IllFlower> Aoi: By the way, you come delivering news of a witch. That's all.
[22-Jun-2013 20:17:47]  <Aoi> 14right now?

[22-Jun-2013 20:19:59]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun casually calls out to Aoi, even as Snezana's hands close on his throat. "Hey, Aoi. What's up?" **
[22-Jun-2013 20:20:28]  * Aoi starts, but sidles in
[22-Jun-2013 20:20:50]  <Aoi> "Uh... I didn't want to interrupt this uh... mafia deal?"
[22-Jun-2013 20:20:50]  * Snezana kicks the wall where pyunpyun is sitting, which suddenly appears to implode

[22-Jun-2013 20:22:31]  <Snezana> "n-ot n-oww, it can't start now"
[22-Jun-2013 20:22:56]  * Snezana struggles to get up, using the wall as a brace, forgetting she destroyed it and falls through"
[22-Jun-2013 20:23:17]  * Aoi dumbfounded by all this.

[22-Jun-2013 20:25:21]  <Aoi> "Uh... s-sure..."
[22-Jun-2013 20:25:26]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun, for his part, seems to have vanished. Useful as always, isn't he.
[22-Jun-2013 20:25:43]  * Aoi takes out a cellphone, texts "is pyunpyun a drug dealer" to Yui
[22-Jun-2013 20:25:46]  <Snezana> "We-we can't call using a cellphone, you got change for a pay-phone?"
[22-Jun-2013 20:26:08]  <Aoi> A pay...? Do those even exist?
[22-Jun-2013 20:26:22]  <Aoi> 14er, that was supposed to be dialogue.

[22-Jun-2013 20:26:58]  <IllFlower> A blinking light catches Aoi's attention. There's a phone sitting in the corner, next to the ancient television set.
[22-Jun-2013 20:27:15]  <Aoi> "Uh, is that thing a payphone?"
[22-Jun-2013 20:27:18]  <IllFlower> It looks like Pyunpyun has 76 new messages, to boot.

[22-Jun-2013 20:44:43]  <Snezana> "Listen, Pyun-pyun probably let you go since he doesn't have to track initiates under his control, do you understand?"
[22-Jun-2013 20:45:17]  <Snezana> "H-He knew about the photo, and he knew who I was before and I never told him anything about the past, so he's clearly deciding to not know about things, understand?"
[22-Jun-2013 20:45:46]  <Snezana> "S-So if you see anyone suspicious, be careful, its probably whoever sent that photo and I think its someone local- or at least someone local is being used by Scorcher."
[22-Jun-2013 20:46:34]  <Snezana> "Listen there's a Witch In the 'Red District', So I have to get off, but just spread the word and stay around people pyun-pyun still has under its wing."

[22-Jun-2013 20:49:50]  <Yui> "I saw a guy with a familiar earlier and I talked to him a bit, but he seemed really nice, not suspicious. He said he lived in the area and we're meeting up later on in the vague future."
[22-Jun-2013 20:50:48]  <Snezana> "... You don't see how this all sounds supicious. I mean a ki--the stalker isn't going to cackle evily as he lures you in to get killed."
[22-Jun-2013 20:51:07]  <Snezana> "w-wait
[22-Jun-2013 20:51:15]  <Yui> "but but that's how it happens in the stories I read!"
[22-Jun-2013 20:51:25]  <Snezana> "The photo said to beware of a 'friendly stranger', what if it wasn't talking about me? I wasn't exactly friendly"
[22-Jun-2013 20:51:36]  <Yui> "...oh"
[22-Jun-2013 20:52:31]  <Snezana> "Oh shit I just figured out that-- shit"
[22-Jun-2013 20:52:54]  <Snezana> "Look, just stay safe, we got to meet up again in the future, just tell Sumire to becareful"

[22-Jun-2013 20:54:55]  <Snezana> Shit I'll be right back
[22-Jun-2013 20:55:03]  * Snezana runs back into the building to get the knife"
[22-Jun-2013 20:55:25]  <Aoi> "Oh why did I not take judo instead, oh god."
[22-Jun-2013 20:55:42]  * Snezana looks at her right hand, her fingers are contorted
[22-Jun-2013 20:56:04]  <Snezana> "Okay, let start with formal introductions
[22-Jun-2013 20:56:20]  * Snezana extends her left hand, "My name is Snezana, but everyone calls me Yukiko"
[22-Jun-2013 20:56:48]  <Snezana> ((Everyone just calls me barkeep))
[22-Jun-2013 20:57:06]  * Aoi shakes with left, after a pause. "Aoi. Or uh, maybe you already heard that from Yui. I don't know."
[22-Jun-2013 20:57:43]  * Snezana also gives back her phone
[22-Jun-2013 20:57:51]  <Snezana> "Sorry about that, its just that safety is priority
[22-Jun-2013 20:57:58]  <Aoi> 14you mean aoi's phone?
[22-Jun-2013 20:58:10]  <Snezana> ((Yeah, I kind of destroyed pyun-pyun's phone

[22-Jun-2013 20:59:31]  <IllFlower> A small explosion sounds off in the distance amid a cacophony of sirens. From the steps leading up to Pyunpyun's cave, Aoi sees a block of buildings on fire where he spotted the witch earlier. **
[22-Jun-2013 20:59:58]  <IllFlower> We all occasionally need reminders that Aoi's male. ;)
[22-Jun-2013 21:00:03]  <Aoi> "Oh, fuck, oh fuck that wasn't supposed to happen."
[22-Jun-2013 21:01:00]  <Aoi> "OK, Yukiko, let's go let's g- wait, uh, sirens, you're ok with the police or whatever, right...?"

[22-Jun-2013 21:03:38]  <Snezana> "Also did anyone ever say you look kind of feminine" 
[22-Jun-2013 21:04:29]  * Aoi groans. "You fit right in with the rest of them, that's for sure."
[22-Jun-2013 21:05:00]  * Snezana begins to run towards the fire
[22-Jun-2013 21:05:33]  * Aoi same
[22-Jun-2013 21:05:47]  <Snezana> "Anyways, Right now i'm being hunted by someone from where I am from, and he's also after Yui. Pyun-pyun released Makoto and Yui from his protection, and Yui just came across someone we warned to avoid."
[22-Jun-2013 21:06:07]  <Snezana> "And this person may be using someone locally to track us... you keeping up with all this."
[22-Jun-2013 21:07:02]  <Aoi> "What?! Why'd he do that? Pyun-pyun, I mean."
[22-Jun-2013 21:07:11]  <Aoi> "And what did Yui do! And oh wait I should probably transform huh."
[22-Jun-2013 21:07:46]  <Snezana> "Well I'm sure they won't notice us transformed as we run past the police into the middle of a fire
[22-Jun-2013 21:07:52]  <Snezana> ... say do you know what parkour is?
[22-Jun-2013 21:08:27]  <IllFlower> As the street in front of the scene comes into view, Aoi and Snezana see a long line of emergency vehicles. A crowd is standing off in the distance, herded in by police officers to keep them from getting too close.
[22-Jun-2013 21:08:34]  <Aoi> "No? You're French?!"
[22-Jun-2013 21:09:19]  <Aoi> 14whoops better wait for description now that i've started this
[22-Jun-2013 21:09:41]  <IllFlower> The vortex marking the entrance to the witch's maze positively engulfs the wall of a building on the end of the block. **
[22-Jun-2013 21:10:10]  <Snezana> "thats odd, we should have seen someone on the way here"
[22-Jun-2013 21:10:22]  <Aoi> "Eh? Who?"
[22-Jun-2013 21:10:53]  <Snezana> ((I missed Illflowers' description

[22-Jun-2013 21:11:55]  <Snezana> "While I'm making a scene, you run towards the vortex and I'll meet you there? ... that is totally not a suspicious thing to ask."
[22-Jun-2013 21:12:10]  <Aoi> "...okay, what the hell!"
[22-Jun-2013 21:12:33]  <IllFlower> I don't think anyone would notice if you just ran for it. It's a bit chaotic. **
[22-Jun-2013 21:12:42]  <Snezana> ((yeah but fun is that)0
[22-Jun-2013 21:12:56]  <Snezana> ((but what fun*))
[22-Jun-2013 21:13:36]  * Aoi transforms. we didn't start the fire, it was always burning, since the witches been turning
[22-Jun-2013 21:14:02]  * Snezana notices a power-line by the crowd
[22-Jun-2013 21:14:15]  <IllFlower> Well, for the sake of time and everything.
[22-Jun-2013 21:15:04]  * Snezana calmly walks next to it, and gives it a gentle touch, which causes it collapse in a brilliant pyrotechnic display that conveniently harms no-one. Snezana then darts through the crowd, reaching to take one of the police officer's pistols as she passes 
[22-Jun-2013 21:15:44]  * Aoi just runs for it
[22-Jun-2013 21:16:22]  * IllFlower scribbles "kleptomaniacal magical girls" in idea notebook
[22-Jun-2013 21:16:54]  <Snezana> ((I like shiny things))
[22-Jun-2013 21:17:29]  <IllFlower> Aoi dives into the witch's barrier, Snezana following behind at her own pace.
[22-Jun-2013 21:18:42]  * Snezana transforms, enveloping herself in a black light, she approaches in what appears to be fabric laced with circuitry, connected to a pair of gloves. she slides into the vortex before any of the normals can react or shoot her
[22-Jun-2013 21:18:52]  <IllFlower> The two of them find themselves in... space. Well, at least it's pitch black, with the exception of a giant white-hot ball of flame swirling before them.
[22-Jun-2013 21:19:00]  <IllFlower> There also appears to be no gravity. This ought to be fun. **

[22-Jun-2013 21:31:19]  <IllFlower> Attack succeeds. d6+4+2 damage.
[22-Jun-2013 21:31:22]  * Snezana waits until the witch attacks, as it swipes with a flare-up of flame, snezana snuffs it and goes in for a punch

[22-Jun-2013 21:31:40]  <Snezana> KASHA
[22-Jun-2013 21:31:53]  <IllFlower> Nicely done. 12 damage.
[22-Jun-2013 21:32:28]  <IllFlower> New round. Attribute changes?
[22-Jun-2013 21:32:49]  * Snezana dissapears briefly into the witch, a loud shriek can be heard and snezana gets thrown out. The witch's light seems to be a tad dimmer now
[22-Jun-2013 21:32:56]  <Snezana> Yeah
[22-Jun-2013 21:33:06]  <IllFlower> Go ahead and make them.
[22-Jun-2013 21:33:07]  <Snezana> ((Nitya want me to help get you unbinded?))
[22-Jun-2013 21:33:23]  <Snezana> "Aoi, Do you need any help? That--- thing has you pretty good."
[22-Jun-2013 21:33:34]  <Aoi> Did my lowest attribute being on defense switch the other to support?
[22-Jun-2013 21:33:58]  <IllFlower> Aoi: I switched them since you had to have your lowest attribute on defense, yeah.
[22-Jun-2013 21:34:29]  <Snezana> ((If you want I can put my strongest on support and just forgo an attack))
[22-Jun-2013 21:34:33]  <IllFlower> The rule book doesn't say how to make that change, so I just swapped defense with whichever one was lowest.
[22-Jun-2013 21:34:38]  <Aoi> "Nah, I- urk - I think I can get out myself. Just hit it again, you really pack a punch, haha."
[22-Jun-2013 21:34:58]  <Snezana> "I could see if I could rip it off of you, but your choice"
[22-Jun-2013 21:34:59]  <IllFlower> Aoi, you're still first, assuming you leave your attributes as they are.
[22-Jun-2013 21:35:08]  <Snezana> ((No changes to attributes))
[22-Jun-2013 21:35:34]  <Aoi> yeah, i'll stay as i am.
[22-Jun-2013 21:35:47]  <Aoi> And I'll try to break out
[22-Jun-2013 21:36:00]  <IllFlower> Okay, roll support. 15 or higher to escape.

[22-Jun-2013 21:36:22]  <IllFlower> He can, since it's a magical roll.
[22-Jun-2013 21:36:28]  <Aoi> alright i'll do it

[22-Jun-2013 21:36:52]  <IllFlower> That's a success.
[22-Jun-2013 21:37:03]  <Snezana> ((oh so if you get extra rolls, thats extra OC?))
[22-Jun-2013 21:37:06]  <Snezana> ((That could get ugly))
[22-Jun-2013 21:37:08]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[22-Jun-2013 21:37:24]  <Snezana> At least you're guarnteed to be unbided
[22-Jun-2013 21:37:26]  <IllFlower> Snezana's turn now, while Aoi describes the escape.
[22-Jun-2013 21:37:42]  <Snezana> hmm
[22-Jun-2013 21:38:01]  <Snezana> one overcharge

[22-Jun-2013 21:38:54]  * Aoi stops moving, and rapidly freezes through, starting from the chest. The flaming thrashing breaks him into shards, which reform on the ground.
[22-Jun-2013 21:38:58]  <Snezana> no you don't
[22-Jun-2013 21:38:59]  <IllFlower> +roll m6

[22-Jun-2013 21:39:21]  <IllFlower> +roll m6
[22-Jun-2013 21:39:22]  <rollermine> IllFlower: 3=3
[22-Jun-2013 21:39:47]  <IllFlower> 23 = 23. The witch's base attribute is higher, so it wins unless you want to put on a third OC point.
[22-Jun-2013 21:39:49]  <Snezana> ((Aoi there is no ground))
[22-Jun-2013 21:39:52]  <Snezana> Yes
[22-Jun-2013 21:39:54]  <Snezana> more OC
[22-Jun-2013 21:40:06]  <Sumire> 14you can also burn a relationship point
[22-Jun-2013 21:40:08]  <IllFlower> Okay, go ahead and roll m6.

[22-Jun-2013 21:40:45]  <IllFlower> 28 = 28.
[22-Jun-2013 21:40:56]  <Snezana> are you shitting me
[22-Jun-2013 21:41:06]  <Sumire> 14 you have to burn a point
[22-Jun-2013 21:41:08]  <IllFlower> Neither party can put on any more OC. You can go into relationship burn for an additional point.
[22-Jun-2013 21:41:55]  <Snezana> hmm
[22-Jun-2013 21:42:09]  <Sumire> 14do it
[22-Jun-2013 21:42:49]  <Snezana> Okay, I'm trying to figure out what that does though
[22-Jun-2013 21:42:54]  <Snezana> well I mean what the side-effects are
[22-Jun-2013 21:43:44]  <IllFlower> You lose 1 relationship strain capacity in order to gain 1 attack point. That's it.
[22-Jun-2013 21:44:03]  <Snezana> oh no actual harming of relationships
[22-Jun-2013 21:44:06]  <Snezana> I use it
[22-Jun-2013 21:44:56]  <IllFlower> Okay, 29 > 28. Snezana wins. Roll d6+4+6 for damage.
[22-Jun-2013 21:45:04]  <Snezana> oh boy
[22-Jun-2013 21:45:09]  <Snezana> +roll d6+4+6
[22-Jun-2013 21:45:09]  <rollermine> Snezana: 2+4+6=12
[22-Jun-2013 21:45:15]  <Snezana> weak sauce
[22-Jun-2013 21:45:16]  <IllFlower> 12 damage. That's fatal.
[22-Jun-2013 21:46:48]  * Snezana notices the bind around Aoi tightening, not wanting to see a death in front of her, she removes her gloves and goes berserk on the witch. Tearing apart its tendrils. The Witch dims almost to pitch black, but a sudden conflagration occurs in its death throes, evidently intent on taking Snezana out with it 
[22-Jun-2013 21:47:18]  * Snezana grabs Aoi and acts as a shield, using her control of the void to try to minimize the impact
[22-Jun-2013 21:47:57]  <Snezana> *It mostly works, but Snezana's back gets badly burned*

[22-Jun-2013 21:48:48]  <IllFlower> The witch flares brightly, then vanishes with a piercing scream. The blackness that had formed the witch's maze falls away, leaving Snezana and Aoi hovering over the street... though not for long. The two of them fall awkwardly onto the pavement, though not too hard.
[22-Jun-2013 21:49:07]  <IllFlower> The fire that had been raging in the nearby buildings is now little more than receding smoke. **

[22-Jun-2013 21:49:47]  * Snezana checks to see if Aoi is still conscious
[22-Jun-2013 21:50:16]  <IllFlower> Given that Nitya's not here, it looks like Aoi's out of commission.
[22-Jun-2013 21:50:30]  <IllFlower> Unless we wait for him to come back, that is.
[22-Jun-2013 21:50:35]  <Snezana> "well.. shit, I can't just leave him here."
[22-Jun-2013 21:50:50]  <Snezana> ".. and leaving him in a hospital or out on the street is going to get him killed..."

[22-Jun-2013 22:15:48]  <IllFlower> Okay, done. No effect since it's out of battle, so just go ahead and plot it.

[22-Jun-2013 22:17:31]  <Aoi> "Heh, no..." visible "veins" of water pop out all over Aoi's body from the heart, extend to his fingertips, which he runs over Snezana's burns.
