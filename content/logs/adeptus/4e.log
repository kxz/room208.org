[23-Dec-2011 23:24:34]  <Motoko> It's your typical department store, except fancier...
[23-Dec-2011 23:24:42]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Ooh, fancy, fancy."
[23-Dec-2011 23:24:57]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip allows himself some marvelling once they reach the building. "You know, I have never been cities like this until I arrived here." He searches for information regarding the building as Motoko cuts his search short.
[23-Dec-2011 23:25:01]  * Motoko shushes Jacqueline_de_Macquerel
[23-Dec-2011 23:25:35]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [osip's appreciation of manufactured heights makes his piloting of the half-heighted TRIDENt unfortunate!]
[23-Dec-2011 23:25:42]  <Cassie> "So should we go to the clothing section first, get clothes that are more in style here?"
[23-Dec-2011 23:25:56]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Where did you this information?"
[23-Dec-2011 23:26:13]  <Motoko> Here? I'm pretty sure you could get away with anything *here*...
[23-Dec-2011 23:26:55]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel grins a devious... grin! "Is that so..."
[23-Dec-2011 23:27:10]  <Motoko> Wait, why are you all asking me? This is my first time here too!
[23-Dec-2011 23:27:59]  <Motoko> And don't make faces like that, Jackie. You already stand out.
[23-Dec-2011 23:28:17]  <Cassie> "You just bought a new knife last night Jacqueline. You don't need a new one."
[23-Dec-2011 23:28:21]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip notes jacqueline's expression, :\s. "Well, you mentioned it is a department store, but-oh, here we are." He grimaces, finally finding the lettering.
[23-Dec-2011 23:28:39]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [kana-ing I guess!]
[23-Dec-2011 23:28:56]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki glances for the tail again.
[23-Dec-2011 23:29:09]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> {You may enter at your leisure, I'm sure one or two NERVsonnel are inside already to avoid suspicion.}
[23-Dec-2011 23:29:19]  <Motoko> 14what does that even *mean*, Loki_Weyland
[23-Dec-2011 23:29:33]  <Loki_Weyland> $ He's looking for any Section 2 agents.
[23-Dec-2011 23:29:37]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [one of the NERV eyes, Motok-there you go.]
[23-Dec-2011 23:29:40]  <Loki_Weyland> $ That are tailing the group.
[23-Dec-2011 23:29:40]  <Lou> 1You know.  The tail.  Hurr hurr.
[23-Dec-2011 23:29:44]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "NEVER enough knives."
[23-Dec-2011 23:30:02]  <Motoko> 14That's what I thought, Lou! It wouldn't be out of character for him.
[23-Dec-2011 23:30:30]  * Motoko walks into the building, stops dead in her tracks
[23-Dec-2011 23:30:39]  <Lou> Something wrong?
[23-Dec-2011 23:30:43]  * Lou walks in also
[23-Dec-2011 23:31:03]  <Loki_Weyland> Seems just fine to me.
[23-Dec-2011 23:31:03]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] enters as the last of the others enter [assuming so since they're not saying they are >:( ]
[23-Dec-2011 23:31:08]  * Motoko looks around frantically
[23-Dec-2011 23:31:11]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki steps in, glancing at Motoko.
[23-Dec-2011 23:31:17]  <Cassie> "There will be too many knives if they start spilling over into mine or Pilot Motoko's rooms. I think Miss Yumi is already unnerved by your collection."
[23-Dec-2011 23:31:19]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [oh right, miss macquerel is cardboarding for a little bit]
[23-Dec-2011 23:31:22]  <Loki_Weyland> He then looks around, trying to see what Motoko's looking for.
[23-Dec-2011 23:31:26]  <Motoko> This is even bigger than it looked like from the outside...
[23-Dec-2011 23:31:40]  <Lou> It would be hard not to be, Pilot Cassie.
[23-Dec-2011 23:32:11]  <Motoko> Cassie, you should go with Jackie. Keep her in check, you know?
[23-Dec-2011 23:32:19]  <Loki_Weyland> Good idea.
[23-Dec-2011 23:32:31]  <Motoko> I'm going to... uh...
[23-Dec-2011 23:32:33]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "So it seems," he notes, as vast inventories and opposing-wall mirror tricks multiply the apparent internal space.
[23-Dec-2011 23:32:42]  * Motoko closes eyes and stabs finger in an arbitrary direction
[23-Dec-2011 23:32:54]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel drapes an arm around Cassie. "I agree with Loki."
[23-Dec-2011 23:33:09]  <Loki_Weyland> You're going to drag me into this too, aren't you?
[23-Dec-2011 23:33:23]  <Motoko> *under breath* I'm sorry, Cassie, I'm so sorry.
[23-Dec-2011 23:34:15]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] looks off into the distance for a moment, then glances at the two girls. He then looks around for something of interest. "Do as you please, just meet here for around…."
[23-Dec-2011 23:34:31]  <Motoko> 14Osip_Zhgun[Barcode], you should probably do something to keep the group together so things don't get unwieldy!
[23-Dec-2011 23:34:38]  * Lou looks sidelong at Osip
[23-Dec-2011 23:34:43]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip checks his watch. "Seven?"
[23-Dec-2011 23:34:56]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [not actually seven, just pretend it's a number that makes sense. and don't you worry motoko]
[23-Dec-2011 23:35:09]  <Cassie> "That plan is acceptable Pilot Motoko" says Cassie with a silght smile
[23-Dec-2011 23:35:38]  <Motoko> 14That was supposed to be inaudible, but okay.
[23-Dec-2011 23:35:51]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [it is inaudible! these are OOCbrackets]
[23-Dec-2011 23:36:07]  <Cassie> [Not the under the breach part. just that she deals with Jackie]
[23-Dec-2011 23:36:08]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [oh.]
[23-Dec-2011 23:36:19]  <Motoko> 14Right, that, yeah.
[23-Dec-2011 23:36:41]  <Motoko> Okay, you three have fun! *nervous wave*
[23-Dec-2011 23:37:25]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Well, I suppose- hold on," Osip stumbles momentarily, verbally. "Would you mind at least telling me where you are all going?"
[23-Dec-2011 23:37:36]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "I dunno."
[23-Dec-2011 23:37:42]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel smiles.
[23-Dec-2011 23:37:53]  <Motoko> They've all got their phones, right?
[23-Dec-2011 23:38:18]  <Lou> Even if we don't know how to use them...
[23-Dec-2011 23:38:42]  <Motoko> As long as they're not all horribly distracted, we should be able to get in touch, right?
[23-Dec-2011 23:38:52]  <Loki_Weyland> So it's a lost cause, then.
[23-Dec-2011 23:39:31]  <Cassie> "If all else fails pilot Loki and Jacqueline can cause a scene that should let you find us.
[23-Dec-2011 23:39:44]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] pats his own. "Yes, I suppose. Well, keep yourselves out of trouble; I obviously can't keep an eye on all of you but don't think I can not reach you in time."
[23-Dec-2011 23:39:47]  <Loki_Weyland> Sure, easy enough.
[23-Dec-2011 23:40:15]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Cassie: pilots*?]
[23-Dec-2011 23:40:26]  <Motoko> That's like activating the car alarm to find your car... well, if all else fails. At least *try* to answer your phone, though.
[23-Dec-2011 23:40:35]  <Loki_Weyland> Fine, fine.
[23-Dec-2011 23:40:40]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> can not keep an eye on all of you*
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:01]  <Motoko> 14I am keyboard break.
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:07]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Hoho, sounds like fun~"
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:12]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [As you wish, we can take a break here for…how long do you need?]
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:19]  <Motoko> 14Should we take an intermission now? Maybe fifteen minutes.
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:27]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Fifteen will work
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:31]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [fifteen will work]*
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:35]  <Motoko> SESSION PAUSE
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:38]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [SCENE BREAK, ROUND ONE] PAUSE
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:45]  <Loki_Weyland> Oh, one thing I should mention. There are certain people who believe that Weyland Industries is part of the Illuminati, and that I'm basically the Crown Prince of Evil.
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:47]  <Motoko> We'll start again at the top of the hour.
[23-Dec-2011 23:41:57]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Sure.

[24-Dec-2011 00:01:11]  <Motoko> Except for the side plot where one of the characters is a washed-up manga artist and half of his dialogue is in Japanese.
[24-Dec-2011 00:01:16]  <Motoko> Pretty hilarious Japanese.
[24-Dec-2011 00:01:40]  <Motoko> Alkthash: The character. I don't think the Lonely Island are all that big in mainland China.

[24-Dec-2011 00:03:26]  <Lou> plot twist: nothing happened
[24-Dec-2011 00:03:37]  <Motoko> Solstace: We have managed to strand ourselves in the lower levels of Shibuya-3 109-3, and an Angel is coming! Much like the British!
[24-Dec-2011 00:04:12]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Motoko: Get with the times, maaan! It's the British*-3*.
[24-Dec-2011 00:05:45]  <Motoko-3> But yes, nothing of import happened, and if you feel like jerking us halfway across the planet at this very moment, I doubt anyone would object.
[24-Dec-2011 00:05:53]  <Alkthash> Gah, I burned the food.
[24-Dec-2011 00:06:10]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Motoko-3:  Osip would become very silent and subservient after about two hours real-time, though.
[24-Dec-2011 00:06:32]  <Solstace> Gimme a few minutes, reading through logs.
[24-Dec-2011 00:06:39]  <Motoko-3> Dance, Osip, dance!

[24-Dec-2011 00:08:10]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] doesn't.
[24-Dec-2011 00:09:10]  <Motoko-3> Solstace: I hope you keep that idea up your sleeve. It'll be great for when the espionage plot kicks in!
[24-Dec-2011 00:09:42]  <Solstace> It'll be just like a James Bond movie!  He'll have a steamy, yet short-lived affair with a hot Russian spy!

[24-Dec-2011 00:19:02]  <Loki_Weyland> Dunno.
[24-Dec-2011 00:19:17]  <Solstace> I can attempt to wing some sort of urban adventure that's non-canon.
[24-Dec-2011 00:19:17]  <Loki_Weyland> Reschedule?
[24-Dec-2011 00:19:37]  <Solstace> Or, depending on what time constraints we have, I can actually attempt to start the originally planned session.
[24-Dec-2011 00:19:41]  <Solstace> We could also reschedule.

[24-Dec-2011 00:21:17]  <Motoko-3> I don't really care how long we run.

[24-Dec-2011 00:23:21]  <Loki_Weyland> Pretty open.
[24-Dec-2011 00:23:21]  <Alkthash> Right now?
[24-Dec-2011 00:23:28]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Yeah. Enough time to finish this impromptubiya-3 session?
[24-Dec-2011 00:23:28]  <Alkthash> I think I'm fine for two more hours.
[24-Dec-2011 00:23:36]  <Lou> I don't think I'm doing anything.
[24-Dec-2011 00:23:39]  <Loki_Weyland> Sure.
[24-Dec-2011 00:23:47]  <Loki_Weyland> Mochi can wait.
[24-Dec-2011 00:23:51]  <Alkthash> After the 26th I should be able to do stuff for another session.
[24-Dec-2011 00:24:00]  <Solstace> Yeah, I"ll set up another vote tonight.
[24-Dec-2011 00:24:02]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> I have the rset of the day.

[24-Dec-2011 00:24:11]  <Solstace> I'm basically open for the next two weeks.
[24-Dec-2011 00:24:31]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> If Loki's okay for that, then, we're good. As for me, I don't think I have even the 27th, but I'll be back around the 2nd.
[24-Dec-2011 00:24:44]  <Solstace> Kk.
[24-Dec-2011 00:24:51]  <Solstace> Like I said, I'll set up another poll tonight.
[24-Dec-2011 00:24:54]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Right.
[24-Dec-2011 00:25:22]  <Solstace> So, I'm currently rescanning the logs of what's happened so far.
[24-Dec-2011 00:25:33]  *** Solstace is now known as Asuka
[24-Dec-2011 00:25:51]  <Loki_Weyland> There's a thought. What kind of GM do you think Asuka would be?
[24-Dec-2011 00:25:55]  <Loki_Weyland> A bad one, I'm sure.
[24-Dec-2011 00:25:57]  <Loki_Weyland> But how?
[24-Dec-2011 00:26:00]  <Asuka> Yeah, kind of terrible.

[24-Dec-2011 00:26:13]  <Motoko-3> My schedule for next week is very unclear.
[24-Dec-2011 00:26:18]  <Loki_Weyland> She'd probably have an overpowered GMPC, I think.
[24-Dec-2011 00:26:21]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> A shitty godmodder who'd interrupt the GM every so often to bash someone over the head.
[24-Dec-2011 00:26:24]  <Asuka> You can't even get past this first trap? What kind of players are you!  
[24-Dec-2011 00:26:31]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> Pfft.
[24-Dec-2011 00:26:34]  * Asuka flips over the minatures board
[24-Dec-2011 00:26:44]  <Loki_Weyland> Yeah, she wouldn't last long.
[24-Dec-2011 00:26:46]  <Motoko-3> Things will be more settled after the new year.
[24-Dec-2011 00:26:49]  <Cassie> Pussies, come on lets run the tomb of horrors with your characters!

[24-Dec-2011 00:27:14]  <Loki_Weyland> She'd make a bad player, too.
[24-Dec-2011 00:27:26]  <Loki_Weyland> She'd probably play something along the lines of Leeroy Jenkins.
[24-Dec-2011 00:27:28]  <Asuka> She'd be a sore loser, yeah.

[24-Dec-2011 00:32:21]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Wrestling does damage? what]
[24-Dec-2011 00:32:52]  <Asuka> No, wrestling makes things prone and disarms, so that more damage can be dealt more easily.
[24-Dec-2011 00:32:54]  <Asuka> IIRC.
[24-Dec-2011 00:33:42]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Through sheer luck or GM fiat, possibly both, I survive with −4 HP]
[24-Dec-2011 00:33:50]  <Cassie> The character was a monk, who can get pretty crazy unarmed damage output.

[24-Dec-2011 00:35:53]  <Lou> Discovery, cynicism, what's the difference?
[24-Dec-2011 00:36:03]  <Asuka> Eh, it's to be expected.
[24-Dec-2011 00:36:08]  <Asuka> Anyways, what are the groups.

[24-Dec-2011 00:36:50]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> Yeah, what Cassie said.
[24-Dec-2011 00:37:08]  <Asuka> (Oh, did mentions of Evangelions/Angels come up in the session?)
[24-Dec-2011 00:37:14]  <Motoko-3> As if we would have split into any other groups.

[24-Dec-2011 00:37:40]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [or no?]
[24-Dec-2011 00:38:06]  <Asuka> It means the mentions didn't raise suspicions in a certain third party.
[24-Dec-2011 00:38:20]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [oops.]
[24-Dec-2011 00:38:26]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [well I Mean, good for us, but]

[24-Dec-2011 00:38:30]  <Lou> Better be cultists
[24-Dec-2011 00:38:34]  <Asuka> Close.
[24-Dec-2011 00:38:36]  <Motoko-3> It's Lou's girlfriend, obviously.
[24-Dec-2011 00:38:37]  <Asuka> But not quite.

[24-Dec-2011 00:39:30]  <Asuka> So, two groups.
[24-Dec-2011 00:39:37]  <Motoko-3> Who knows? This could end up being a romantic drama RP centered around a love triangle.
[24-Dec-2011 00:39:48]  <Motoko-3> I'm sure Osip would sooner kill himself, but...
[24-Dec-2011 00:39:51]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [FIghting Angels…while fighting the enemy WITHIN]
[24-Dec-2011 00:40:05]  <Asuka> pffft.
[24-Dec-2011 00:40:13]  <Asuka> Anyways.
[24-Dec-2011 00:40:19]  <Asuka> What is each group doing?
[24-Dec-2011 00:40:29]  <Lou> I don't even know which group I'm in!
[24-Dec-2011 00:40:35]  <Motoko-3> We haven't really done anything yet.
[24-Dec-2011 00:40:45]  <Asuka> That's why I"m asking!
[24-Dec-2011 00:40:46]  <Motoko-3> We went to intermission just as we split up.
[24-Dec-2011 00:40:52]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (Yeah, that.)
[24-Dec-2011 00:41:09]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Motoko was looking for a direction to go. Lou glanced over at me but that was it. Osip was gonna go look at some utilitarian stuffs. Like, Iunno ,pocket knives or wallets I guess?
[24-Dec-2011 00:41:14]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [brackets*]
[24-Dec-2011 00:41:14]  <Motoko-3> Jackie did seem typically interested in buying knives.
[24-Dec-2011 00:41:22]  <Lou> ~fashionable~ knives
[24-Dec-2011 00:41:32]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [The other three were off to do God knows what, but together, I suppose.]
[24-Dec-2011 00:41:39]  * Lou got all his information on Shibuya from a video game about clothes!
[24-Dec-2011 00:41:43]  <Motoko-3> Why are we bracketing, anyway? We're not in character.
[24-Dec-2011 00:41:57]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> I assumed Asuka was in GM mode.
[24-Dec-2011 00:42:08]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [aren't thou?]
[24-Dec-2011 00:42:17]  <Motoko-3> She hasn't called session start, so I would assume otherwise...
[24-Dec-2011 00:42:28]  <Lou> how fickle gender is
[24-Dec-2011 00:42:31]  <Asuka> Unfortunately for Jacqueline, I'm pretty sure 109 doesn't have knives of her preference.
[24-Dec-2011 00:42:35]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (Eh, she's probably going to go ~shopping~)
[24-Dec-2011 00:43:05]  <Asuka> Motoko-3: It's inevitably going to be an incredibly informal session anyway :/
[24-Dec-2011 00:43:11]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [GET OVER HERE! (o 'n')—o~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~> ]
[24-Dec-2011 00:43:17]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (Pfft.)
[24-Dec-2011 00:43:24]  <Cassie> [so are we go now?]
[24-Dec-2011 00:43:28]  <Asuka> Yes.
[24-Dec-2011 00:43:33]  <Motoko-3> We were making things up as we went anyway. I'm just waiting for someone to call start.
[24-Dec-2011 00:43:46]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> SESSION BEGIN
[24-Dec-2011 00:43:51]  <Lou> [so much for loki]
[24-Dec-2011 00:43:58]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [isn't he here? Loki_Weyland?]
[24-Dec-2011 00:44:02]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [shit.]
[24-Dec-2011 00:44:05]  <Loki_Weyland> Yo.
[24-Dec-2011 00:44:17]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Loki_Weyland: Starting again, Soulstice has taken his throne, same scenario.]
[24-Dec-2011 00:44:28]  <Motoko-3> He's in the hospital hallucinating.
[24-Dec-2011 00:44:32]  <Cassie> "Jacqueline can we look for clothes instead?" asks Cassie trying to puzzle out where the clothing sections are.
[24-Dec-2011 00:44:34]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Same old ceiling.]
[24-Dec-2011 00:45:07]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Of course, Cass. They probably only have piece-of-shit swiss armies," Jacq mutters.
[24-Dec-2011 00:46:16]  <Cassie> "I'm sure you and Loki can console yourself with the many fine animes they have somewhere." says Cassie while patting Jacqueline on the shoulder.
[24-Dec-2011 00:46:24]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "It's anime."
[24-Dec-2011 00:46:51]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] glances concernedly at Lou and Motoko. "Well…have you two figured out something to do?"
[24-Dec-2011 00:47:10]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "I don't think 'figure' is in Lou's dictionary..."
[24-Dec-2011 00:47:26]  <Loki_Weyland> Anime? Please, I have an internet connection.
[24-Dec-2011 00:47:28]  <Motoko-3> 14Wait, what's going on? ._.
[24-Dec-2011 00:47:36]  <Lou> I can't figure out how you're trying to insult me, at least.
[24-Dec-2011 00:47:47]  <Motoko-3> 14I was waiting for some cue from Asuka about what's happening.
[24-Dec-2011 00:47:55]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I thought, ewll,he said-]
[24-Dec-2011 00:48:05]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [ <_> ]
[24-Dec-2011 00:48:19]  <Asuka> (really, I think you guys are mostly going to run this, except when I feel like tossing in an NPC or making something happen >.>)
[24-Dec-2011 00:48:37]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [K.]
[24-Dec-2011 00:48:51]  <Motoko> 14Oh, well then.
[24-Dec-2011 00:49:02]  * Motoko skips off in an arbitrary direction
[24-Dec-2011 00:49:28]  <Cassie> "Come on Jacqueline. I want to see want dresses for when we inevitably get thrown in some formal wear party at NERV's bequest.
[24-Dec-2011 00:49:32]  <Lou> ...
[24-Dec-2011 00:49:51]  <Loki_Weyland> Good planning.
[24-Dec-2011 00:50:08]  * Lou decides he may as well follow Motoko, checking for anything interesting in the shops as he does...
[24-Dec-2011 00:50:30]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki appears to be doing the same.
[24-Dec-2011 00:50:49]  <Motoko> 14Can we cue a montage of Motoko in increasingly ridiculous outfits?
[24-Dec-2011 00:50:55]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Make it frilly!" Jacq says as she follows.
[24-Dec-2011 00:51:01]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> ( We're gonna need a montage~ )
[24-Dec-2011 00:51:04]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (brb)
[24-Dec-2011 00:51:09]  <Asuka> ....
[24-Dec-2011 00:51:11]  <Cassie> "... if you insist Jacqueline."
[24-Dec-2011 00:51:25]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [rules don't include any rolls for ridiculousness, so you can probably do a linear increase on that axis]

[24-Dec-2011 00:52:17]  * Motoko looks up and down at Osip
[24-Dec-2011 00:52:37]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] drifts around the store, trying his best to keep an eye on the others as he peruses the more downplayed fronts. [oops this is late]
[24-Dec-2011 00:53:04]  * Motoko takes a rubber duck from a nearby shelf and puts it on Osip's head
[24-Dec-2011 00:53:35]  <Lou> You're in a good mood.
[24-Dec-2011 00:54:07]  <Cassie> Cassie spins around with a white dress with blue frills and a low neckline on it. "Is this acceptable where the frills are concerned Jacqueline"
[24-Dec-2011 00:54:50]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki raises his eyebrows.
[24-Dec-2011 00:54:59]  * Motoko runs around, picking clothes at random from the racks and putting them back on
[24-Dec-2011 00:55:12]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> 6g(back)
[24-Dec-2011 00:55:17]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] stands up slightly from the feeling of the duck, knocking it off. He glances awkwardly as he replaces it
[24-Dec-2011 00:55:24]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [how does 6g mean back]
[24-Dec-2011 00:55:24]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Yes, verrryyy much..."
[24-Dec-2011 00:55:56]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> glances around awkwardly*
[24-Dec-2011 00:56:02]  <Cassie> "Why did you elongate the very like that..." asks a now confused Cassie.
[24-Dec-2011 00:56:25]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki glares at Jackie.
[24-Dec-2011 00:56:33]  <Cassie> She looks at Loki "Come on, we need to find a nice suit for you too."
[24-Dec-2011 00:56:43]  <Loki_Weyland> I'll be fine.
[24-Dec-2011 00:56:56]  <Motoko> Hm...
[24-Dec-2011 00:56:58]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "What, don't appreciate the neckline, Loki? Confirmed bachelor, are we?"
[24-Dec-2011 00:56:59]  <Loki_Weyland> I've been to formal things before, despite my efforts.
[24-Dec-2011 00:57:06]  <Motoko> Lou, could you come over here for a moment?
[24-Dec-2011 00:57:16]  <Lou> ...sure.
[24-Dec-2011 00:57:17]  <Loki_Weyland> I'm just saying you should let the girl have some dignity.

[24-Dec-2011 00:59:09]  <Lou> ...what are you doing
[24-Dec-2011 00:59:26]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Yes, please~"
[24-Dec-2011 00:59:29]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel leers.
[24-Dec-2011 00:59:37]  <Asuka> Loki, Jacq, Cassie:  As you are browsing the aisles, you see a somewhat familiar posture: slouched and full of lack-of-presence.  It's the kid who asked you guys about possibly being pilots at lunch the other day.
[24-Dec-2011 00:59:49]  <Loki_Weyland> Ah, crap.
[24-Dec-2011 01:00:00]  <Loki_Weyland> Mix into the crowd, guys.
[24-Dec-2011 01:00:01]  <Asuka> Yuuki Ashikaga, in case you forgot hisname.
[24-Dec-2011 01:00:43]  * Motoko takes another dress from the rack, a violently red one
[24-Dec-2011 01:00:52]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] decides he wouldn't need a multitool, looks through wallets. For obvious reasons, he doesn't notice the stoop kid.
[24-Dec-2011 01:00:53]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Hey, Yuuki~", Jacq calls out.
[24-Dec-2011 01:01:04]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> ( HEY, STOOP KID WON'T LEAVE HIS STOOP! ))
[24-Dec-2011 01:01:07]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki bites his teeth.

[24-Dec-2011 01:01:46]  <Cassie> "Jacqueline, can you carry the dresses for me?" asks Cassie picking up on Loki's cue and trying to shush her.
[24-Dec-2011 01:01:57]  <Asuka> Jacqueline_de_Macquerel: Your call doesn't go unnoticed.  He turns in your direction, and a look that's a delicious combination of surprise and SHIT, NO! comes across his face.
[24-Dec-2011 01:01:59]  <Lou> Should we get a... uh...
[24-Dec-2011 01:02:20]  <Motoko> Okay, Lou, now I need you to hold your arms up in the air...
[24-Dec-2011 01:02:26]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel enjoys his fear.
[24-Dec-2011 01:02:27]  * Lou 's sarcasm is ruined once again by an inability to remember any stereotypically masculine clothing
[24-Dec-2011 01:02:35]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (IT IS A MOST DELICIOUS FEAR.)
[24-Dec-2011 01:02:39]  <Asuka> "Y-yes...?"
[24-Dec-2011 01:03:02]  * Lou complies.  "Are you trying to find me a dress...?"
[24-Dec-2011 01:03:16]  * Motoko pulls the dress over Lou's head and arms
[24-Dec-2011 01:03:32]  * Motoko nods sagely
[24-Dec-2011 01:03:50]  <Motoko> Just as I thought, this looks absolutely hilarious on you.

[24-Dec-2011 01:10:15]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "…Er, regarding the outfit…"
[24-Dec-2011 01:10:30]  <Motoko> 14Asuka, is there still winter in this post-apocalyptic hellscape, or should I disregard the need to buy winter clothes?

[24-Dec-2011 01:11:48]  <Asuka> Jacqueline_de_Macquerel: After pondering the invite for a somewhat long time, Yuuki nods his head.
[24-Dec-2011 01:11:49]  <Lou> "yes, please..." emerges muffled.
[24-Dec-2011 01:11:59]  <Asuka> Loki_Weyland: It's Evangelion canon.

[24-Dec-2011 01:13:07]  <Lou> Motoko put it on me.  She's very... cheery
[24-Dec-2011 01:13:11]  <Cassie> Cassie frowns and whispers to Loki "Why is Jacqueline inviting him along? He was annoying in class."
[24-Dec-2011 01:13:15]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki thinks; "Shit, she's coming this way!"
[24-Dec-2011 01:13:23]  <Loki_Weyland> She wants to mess with him some more.
[24-Dec-2011 01:13:37]  <Loki_Weyland> Normally I'd do the same, but he's a bit too snoopy for my taste.
[24-Dec-2011 01:13:56]  <Cassie> "Snoopy?"
[24-Dec-2011 01:14:08]  <Asuka> "So... ummmm....."
[24-Dec-2011 01:14:17]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] looks aroundfor the rack. "Well, Lou. I do not think being in a good mood is against r…the rules."
[24-Dec-2011 01:14:22]  <Loki_Weyland> Inquisitive.

[24-Dec-2011 01:14:41]  <Lou> It's against her rules... not to this extent... it's wrong...

[24-Dec-2011 01:15:28]  * Motoko comes back, collapses on a nearby bench
[24-Dec-2011 01:15:54]  <Asuka> Lou: Let's just say that you guys have been informed of the upcoming trip to Norway already.
[24-Dec-2011 01:15:56]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip looks at Lou, sobering. "I do not think I have access to such information; regardless I would only be informed if-"
[24-Dec-2011 01:16:24]  <Lou> I mean.  A blue pattern.  O- oh there she is shit
[24-Dec-2011 01:16:24]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Motoko! Are you okay?" [what kind of collapse is this]

[24-Dec-2011 01:18:42]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [not even applicable in the slightest]
[24-Dec-2011 01:18:56]  <Lou> Uh....
[24-Dec-2011 01:19:00]  <Lou> Feeling homesick?
[24-Dec-2011 01:19:28]  <Asuka> Yuuki turns to Jacqueline.  "Maybe this.. .wasn't such a good idea...."
[24-Dec-2011 01:19:32]  <Motoko> Shopping really does need that social experience, you know?
[24-Dec-2011 01:20:13]  <Motoko> Oh, not to say that you're not a person or anything, Lulu-chan, you're just not exactly suited for this.
[24-Dec-2011 01:20:25]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel frowns. "Don't worry, Cassie just hates people who ask questions. Herself included."
[24-Dec-2011 01:20:31]  <Loki_Weyland> "Lulu-chan?"
[24-Dec-2011 01:20:36]  <Lou> ...
[24-Dec-2011 01:20:58]  <Asuka> Jacqueline_de_Macquerel: "I ... see...?"
[24-Dec-2011 01:21:00]  <Motoko> Oh, Loki, I didn't see you there. Where have you been?
[24-Dec-2011 01:21:00]  <ponicalica> 14RUUUUUURUUUUUUUUSHUUUUUUUUUUUUU
[24-Dec-2011 01:21:01]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] glances at Motoko, sombrely. He is unsure if he should interject.
[24-Dec-2011 01:21:09]  <Loki_Weyland> With them.
[24-Dec-2011 01:21:17]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki motions to Jackie and Cassie.
[24-Dec-2011 01:21:27]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "So, why'd you come here today~?" She asks, uh, Yuuki.
[24-Dec-2011 01:21:34]  <Motoko> Wait, who's the other one?
[24-Dec-2011 01:21:47]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [he further refrains when he realizes loki has started conversation]
[24-Dec-2011 01:21:57]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "A schoolmate?"
[24-Dec-2011 01:22:08]  <Lou> Are you going to ke- eh.
[24-Dec-2011 01:22:19]  <Asuka> "Ummmm, mostly because it's something to do....."
[24-Dec-2011 01:22:32]  <Motoko> He looks kind of familiar...
[24-Dec-2011 01:22:46]  <Cassie> "Why are you walking through the women's clothing section by yourself?"
[24-Dec-2011 01:22:53]  * Lou regards Yuuki silently
[24-Dec-2011 01:23:00]  <Loki_Weyland> That's something I'd like to know.
[24-Dec-2011 01:23:02]  <Lou> 1Oh shit, I completely wasn't paying attention to this
[24-Dec-2011 01:23:31]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip looks at Yuuki. The last comment leaves him suspicious.
[24-Dec-2011 01:23:42]  <Asuka> Yuuki points to Loki  "The same reason he is!" he says, defensively.
[24-Dec-2011 01:23:58]  <Loki_Weyland> I was there because they were.
[24-Dec-2011 01:24:01]  <Lou> Because Jacqueline bullied you into it?
[24-Dec-2011 01:24:04]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "What something- huh."
[24-Dec-2011 01:24:19]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Bullying is such a harsh word, dear Lou!"
[24-Dec-2011 01:24:22]  <Loki_Weyland> I went there as damage control.
[24-Dec-2011 01:24:28]  <Lou> Appropriately so.
[24-Dec-2011 01:24:42]  <Asuka> "My mother is here, too.  So I'm not here alone."
[24-Dec-2011 01:24:47]  <Loki_Weyland> It says something whem *I'm* the sane one.
[24-Dec-2011 01:24:47]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip realizes his fish-out-of-water status,  quietly attempts to look away unconspicuously
[24-Dec-2011 01:24:54]  <Motoko> This world really does take all kinds, doesn't it?
[24-Dec-2011 01:25:08]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki nods.
[24-Dec-2011 01:25:15]  <Loki_Weyland> Mm hmm.
[24-Dec-2011 01:25:23]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> inconspicuously*

[24-Dec-2011 01:25:44]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Oh, uh, your mom won't mind you coming along, will you~?"
[24-Dec-2011 01:26:11]  <Cassie> "What do you mean you're the sane one here pi- Loki?" asks Cassie.
[24-Dec-2011 01:26:17]  <Asuka> "No, not really.  I have my cell pohne if she needs me..."
[24-Dec-2011 01:26:23]  <Loki_Weyland> I meant compared to Jackie, sorry.
[24-Dec-2011 01:27:49]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I was gonna mutter to Lou something like "here, uh, follow me" but that's too suspicious! so consider it considered in-character]
[24-Dec-2011 01:28:21]  <Asuka> "She's always telling me to go out with friends, too.  Either way, I'm in the clear :/"
[24-Dec-2011 01:28:54]  <Cassie> "Oh. What do you think of these two dresses?" Cassie asks the group, holding up a simple blue one and a black one with stars on it
[24-Dec-2011 01:29:03]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Don't worry, I'll protect you from the harsh words of my fellow classmates," Jacq says, chuckling as she suddenly pulls Cassie into a noogie.
[24-Dec-2011 01:29:25]  <Lou> 1Someone refresh my memory; who is this?
[24-Dec-2011 01:29:41]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [>:/ >me not smiling. Also, @lou, the possible informant]
[24-Dec-2011 01:29:41]  <Loki_Weyland> The guy who asked us if we were controlling the robots at lunch.
[24-Dec-2011 01:29:46]  <Loki_Weyland> I think.
[24-Dec-2011 01:29:59]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (Yeah, I think so.)
[24-Dec-2011 01:30:03]  <Cassie> "Ah, no Jacqueline! " laughs Cassie trying to pry herself loose.

[24-Dec-2011 01:53:48]  <Loki_Weyland> Hold it, Osip! You're playing, too!
[24-Dec-2011 01:53:58]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Wh-but..

[24-Dec-2011 01:54:27]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "With what?"
[24-Dec-2011 01:54:34]  <Loki_Weyland> What would be the best game to drag this guy to?
[24-Dec-2011 01:54:39]  <Cassie> [Is it safe to assume NERV produced and licensed an Evangelion based fighting game?]
[24-Dec-2011 01:54:44]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [not so soon :|]
[24-Dec-2011 01:54:48]  <Asuka> Cassie: Not so soon.

[24-Dec-2011 01:55:02]  <Loki_Weyland> Sounds good.
[24-Dec-2011 01:55:03]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] resigns.
[24-Dec-2011 01:55:06]  <Asuka> The best you'll find is panoramic mech simulator.  Which turns out to be right up Yuuki's alley!
[24-Dec-2011 01:55:13]  <Loki_Weyland> Oh, sweet.
[24-Dec-2011 01:55:20]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (Oh, hey, I remember that.)

[24-Dec-2011 01:57:51]  <Loki_Weyland> Just play the damn game.

[24-Dec-2011 01:58:18]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (What was that huge light-rail gun where it was four people in a room, firing rifles from a star ship?)
[24-Dec-2011 01:58:26]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [this part better happen, I'm likely on my way out]

[24-Dec-2011 01:59:03]  <Loki_Weyland> Hey Yuuki, we have an opponent for you.
[24-Dec-2011 01:59:17]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Make it EXTRA HARD."
[24-Dec-2011 01:59:17]  <Loki_Weyland> He's never played the game before, so give him a bit to get used to the controls.
[24-Dec-2011 01:59:25]  <Asuka> "Allright!  Let's do it!"
[24-Dec-2011 01:59:26]  <Loki_Weyland> Yeah, that too.

[24-Dec-2011 02:05:13]  <Asuka> (For results, how about we each roll 3 dice, and whoever get's the highest result 2/3 times wins?  Or something.
[24-Dec-2011 02:05:14]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> In his head, Osip scoffs at the under-detailed controls. He drops one arm to read the controls, then flips through the selections on-screen.
[24-Dec-2011 02:05:21]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Sounds good to me.]
[24-Dec-2011 02:05:39]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Say, those are the three rounds.]

[24-Dec-2011 02:12:12]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> A much more capable performance ends in defeat. Osip's tactics are sound, but the familiarity with the game necessary to win is simply not there.

[24-Dec-2011 02:12:39]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Oof. Well, good games, Yuuki," he says.
[24-Dec-2011 02:12:55]  <Motoko> ... hm, looks like fun ...
[24-Dec-2011 02:13:12]  <Loki_Weyland> What, you want to face the winner?
[24-Dec-2011 02:13:14]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Yes, I suppose I should try to play more often."

[24-Dec-2011 02:15:02]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip looks over. "Oh, well, do you need some advice?"
[24-Dec-2011 02:15:30]  <Asuka> A rather corny song begins to play, recognizeable as the theme to Gondom Tri-Theta Z by the animu savvy pilots.
[24-Dec-2011 02:15:45]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] leans in and explains the controls a bit more precisely than the sticker does.
[24-Dec-2011 02:16:00]  <Asuka> Yuuki answers it, and after a few "uh-hus" and "yeahs", explains that he needs to go meet his mother.
[24-Dec-2011 02:16:00]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> I had no luck with the skinny one, but it requires precision I do not have yet.

[24-Dec-2011 02:16:44]  * Motoko pokes Yuuki in the shoulder, then points silently at the game
[24-Dec-2011 02:17:16]  <Asuka> "Oh, alright.  One last game before I leave >:D"
[24-Dec-2011 02:17:39]  <Asuka> Yuuki selects the same robot as his game with Osip.
[24-Dec-2011 02:17:40]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I'll link what I had in mind soon as this is done or before I leave]

[24-Dec-2011 02:19:59]  <Cassie> Cassie lets Jacqueline have the plush and asks "Can we come back later. The dancing game they have here is fun."
[24-Dec-2011 02:20:01]  <Asuka> "Hmmm, are you sure you know the controls?  It kind of looked like you were just flailing :/"

[24-Dec-2011 02:20:52]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "We should dance for real sometime, though~"
[24-Dec-2011 02:21:02]  * Motoko stops spinning as the game announces the beginning of the second round
[24-Dec-2011 02:21:06]  <Asuka> Motoko: Definitely implement the Tilde kick.
[24-Dec-2011 02:21:16]  <Asuka> "All right, I'll go a little easier this time!"

[24-Dec-2011 02:22:24]  <Asuka> "o_______________________________o"
[24-Dec-2011 02:22:32]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki is suddenly reminded of his training session with Jackie.
[24-Dec-2011 02:22:42]  * Motoko looks at Yuuki and shrugs silently
[24-Dec-2011 02:23:00]  * Motoko puts feet on the controls for one last round

[24-Dec-2011 02:23:37]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I am scrambling to fluff-ize that]
[24-Dec-2011 02:23:42]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "You can do it, Yuuki!"

[24-Dec-2011 02:23:57]  <Motoko> ありがとうございました
[24-Dec-2011 02:24:14]  <Asuka> Yuuki bows in turn.

[24-Dec-2011 02:24:40]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Motoko: Translation? Google Translate says "Thank you." but I think it loses something.
[24-Dec-2011 02:24:50]  <Asuka> No, that's pretty much it.
[24-Dec-2011 02:24:55]  <Asuka> Arigatou gozaimashita.
[24-Dec-2011 02:25:00]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Ah.
[24-Dec-2011 02:25:00]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [it just takes millions of symbols- oh.]
[24-Dec-2011 02:25:06]  <Asuka> It's nice and polite.

[24-Dec-2011 02:25:19]  <Loki_Weyland> $ The general rule of Japanese is that the longer it takes to say, the more formal it is. I think.
[24-Dec-2011 02:25:26]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [kind of works in english too]
[24-Dec-2011 02:25:29]  <Asuka> Pretty much.
[24-Dec-2011 02:26:10]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel gives Yuuki a pat on the head.
[24-Dec-2011 02:26:35]  <Cassie> [So yeah I just got a phone call. I'm going to be heading out soon too]
[24-Dec-2011 02:26:35]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [oh uh, ] Osip totally looked stunned up there too, just so you know
[24-Dec-2011 02:26:54]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> more mildly of course but
[24-Dec-2011 02:27:02]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki pulls Motoko aside. 'OK, tell me. Were you holding back?'
[24-Dec-2011 02:27:24]  <Cassie> Cassie slips the Ossip plushie into his hands while he is gaping
[24-Dec-2011 02:27:31]  <Asuka> Motoko: (You're getting the "genki girl" thing down waaaaay better now.
[24-Dec-2011 02:27:32]  <Asuka> )
[24-Dec-2011 02:27:48]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (Later, Cassie.)
[24-Dec-2011 02:27:51]  <Lou> 1She's getting the nutso girl thing down better too
[24-Dec-2011 02:28:07]  <Asuka> Nutso is part of the definition of "genki girl".
[24-Dec-2011 02:28:29]  <Lou> 1not what I meant
[24-Dec-2011 02:28:31]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Not in- yeah.]

[24-Dec-2011 02:29:08]  <Asuka> Oh, a marathon map.
[24-Dec-2011 02:29:15]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [anyway! missed chances to talk! perhaps we can Rp mini-encounters on-base if you see anything in here worth rementioning (assuming, say, next session happens the day after this).]

[24-Dec-2011 02:31:21]  <Cassie> Is the squid girl anime any good?
[24-Dec-2011 02:31:40]  <Asuka> Motoko: It's all in the actions!

[24-Dec-2011 02:35:08]  <Motoko> And I think people are starting to notice *them*...
[24-Dec-2011 02:35:10]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Yes," says Osip, "I should be off." He shares goodbyes with the others while getting a head-start to the trains.
[24-Dec-2011 02:35:24]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Later, gator!"
[24-Dec-2011 02:35:28]  <Cassie> [later dude]
[24-Dec-2011 02:35:42]  * Motoko yawns
[24-Dec-2011 02:35:45]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [/cardboard's no longer necessary, but yeah, no more in-canon actions.]
[24-Dec-2011 02:36:00]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [/me keeps a wary eye on the street for his ride]
[24-Dec-2011 02:36:20]  <Cassie> Lets head back everybody.
[24-Dec-2011 02:36:52]  <Motoko> 14Conveniently enough, Osip has his plushie, so he can spend the entire way back staring at it in confusion!
[24-Dec-2011 02:37:18]  <Motoko> 14I think we can call end of session now, really.
[24-Dec-2011 02:37:40]  <Asuka> END OF SESSION
