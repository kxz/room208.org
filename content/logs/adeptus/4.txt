[18-Sep-2011 20:58:40]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: Yeah, I know, especially once I start the thing with you.
[18-Sep-2011 20:59:08]  <Gendo> So, Tokyo-3 Municipal High is pretty damned large.  
[18-Sep-2011 20:59:23]  <Lou> [How large does a school have to be to be damned?]
[18-Sep-2011 20:59:25]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> It looks more like a museum than a high school...

[18-Sep-2011 21:00:06]  <Gendo> Given the state of the grounds (is that a park?), it can be assumed to be very well funded.

[18-Sep-2011 21:01:01]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki looks around for a receptionist.
[18-Sep-2011 21:01:09]  <Lou> There's usually some form of sign...

[18-Sep-2011 21:01:32]  <Gendo> There is a map of the campus near the entrance.

[18-Sep-2011 21:02:50]  * Lou finds first class on map and walks off.
[18-Sep-2011 21:03:05]  <Gendo> The staff room is located at the end of the hallway you're currently on.  Convenient, right?
[18-Sep-2011 21:03:07]  <Gendo> >.>
[18-Sep-2011 21:03:17]  <Cassie> Cassie has no idea what is going on and just follows the others

[18-Sep-2011 21:04:13]  <Gendo> There are a few teachers just about to leave for their classes.
[18-Sep-2011 21:04:28]  <Gendo> One of them looks at you lot expectantly.
[18-Sep-2011 21:04:33]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Hi! My name is Jacqueline de Maquerel. That's what my name is~!

[18-Sep-2011 21:06:22]  <Loki_Weyland> "This is a bit of a relief, actually. In an American high school, I would've had to wait at least ten minutes before anything happened."
[18-Sep-2011 21:06:27]  <Loki_Weyland> "Probably a lot longer."
[18-Sep-2011 21:06:29]  <Motoko> 14ahaha, half of us are young enough that whether we should be in high school is questionable...
[18-Sep-2011 21:06:38]  <Lou> [15?]
[18-Sep-2011 21:06:49]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> And they'd probably be filled with hooligans and idiots not interested in learning, eh, Loki?
[18-Sep-2011 21:07:00]  <Loki_Weyland> "No kidding."
[18-Sep-2011 21:07:08]  <Loki_Weyland> "They're easy to manipulate, though."
[18-Sep-2011 21:07:20]  <Motoko> Yes, I'm so glad we don't have any of those people here... *glares*
[18-Sep-2011 21:07:27]  <Gendo> Motoko: (Interesting.  I thought everyone was 16 >.>)

[18-Sep-2011 21:08:29]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Depends on how tough they think they are, Loki~

[18-Sep-2011 21:09:11]  <Gendo> Mr. Ishii stops by a classroom door.
[18-Sep-2011 21:09:15]  <Lou> [Having a classified surname must make class introductions fun.]

[18-Sep-2011 21:21:40]  <Loki_Weyland> Wilhelm?
[18-Sep-2011 21:21:40]  <Motoko> 14It'd be like giving a Chinese-American boy the name "Kevin"! ... ... ...

[18-Sep-2011 21:24:32]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki notices that one boy in the class is looking rather frightened, and seems to be glancing away from the newcomers.
[18-Sep-2011 21:24:33]  <Gendo> Oh >.>
[18-Sep-2011 21:24:52]  <Lou> [Think before you (don't) act, man!]
[18-Sep-2011 21:25:06]  <Gendo> Well, detailing classes seems like a terrible idea to me.
[18-Sep-2011 21:25:29]  <Lou> [Aw, but confusion at the writing was going to be funny, oh wellllll]
[18-Sep-2011 21:26:28]  <Gendo> So, Japanese class proceeds as you would expect from non-native speakers.  Save for Motoko, who can keep up pretty well.
[18-Sep-2011 21:26:42]  <Gendo> Because, duh.

[18-Sep-2011 21:28:10]  <Gendo> First break comes, and the group of you (conveniently located in the same general area of the classroom), are approached by student with glasses and a serious face.

[18-Sep-2011 21:32:20]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel looks oddly at Cassie. "I doubt anyone's gonna go psycho here."
[18-Sep-2011 21:32:21]  <Lou> "D-don't ask things like that, Cassie, you're not supposed to," Lou says in English.
[18-Sep-2011 21:32:22]  * Motoko looks up and down at Hinata with mild suspicion
[18-Sep-2011 21:32:27]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> This ain't Columbine!
[18-Sep-2011 21:32:27]  <Motoko> It's nice to meet you...
[18-Sep-2011 21:32:31]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki clears his throat.
[18-Sep-2011 21:32:57]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: I figured it was in that order.
[18-Sep-2011 21:33:22]  <Gendo> After that brief exchange, he gives the lot of you a nervous look, before regaining his composure.
[18-Sep-2011 21:33:30]  <Cassie> "Mental distress was fairly common at my old school" explains Cassie, trying to give a reasonable explanation.
[18-Sep-2011 21:34:08]  <Lou> ...
[18-Sep-2011 21:34:21]  <Gendo> "I'm not sure if I can help with that.  That sounds like something better suited for a professional."
[18-Sep-2011 21:34:33]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> I know, you told me, Cass.
[18-Sep-2011 21:34:49]  <Gendo> "I can, however, show you to the cafeteria during lunch, if you'd like".
[18-Sep-2011 21:35:00]  <Loki_Weyland> "Eh, just give 'em a kick in the jimmies and take 'em to the nurse's office. Should work well enough."
[18-Sep-2011 21:35:18]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel shrugs. "In the West, most high schools have conselors, but I hear Japan believes that emotional distress is solved by friends and family."
[18-Sep-2011 21:35:28]  <Motoko> Thank you, Hinata. Lead the way.
[18-Sep-2011 21:35:44]  <Gendo> Motoko: (not lunch right now.  First break between classes)
[18-Sep-2011 21:35:47]  <Gendo> >.>
[18-Sep-2011 21:36:19]  * Motoko seems a little overeager to get away from the rest of her... companions
[18-Sep-2011 21:36:33]  <Lou> [Motoko will eat lunch whenever she damn well pleases!]
[18-Sep-2011 21:36:53]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> "So... what's there to do after school here?"
[18-Sep-2011 21:37:04]  <Gendo> The door opens, and the next teacher walks into the classroom.
[18-Sep-2011 21:37:48]  <Lou> [Japanese high schools are weird.]
[18-Sep-2011 21:38:11]  <Gendo> Throughout this next class, you begin to notice more and more people giving you suspicious glances, and whispering to each other.
[18-Sep-2011 21:38:38]  <Gendo> (brb)
[18-Sep-2011 21:38:49]  <Motoko> 14Keyboard/bathroom break, Gendo?

[18-Sep-2011 21:54:15]  <Gendo> Next break comes, and the class gets loud with discussions and stuff.  Hinata doesn't return this break, which the rest of the class takes as its cue to barrage the transfew students with questions.

[18-Sep-2011 21:54:53]  <Lou> [So heartless.]
[18-Sep-2011 21:54:59]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki responds to any and all questions with non sequiturs.
[18-Sep-2011 21:55:22]  <Gendo> "Where are you from?"  "Do you speak English" "Are you going to join any clubs?" 
[18-Sep-2011 21:55:25]  <Gendo> The questions never stop.

[18-Sep-2011 21:55:51]  <Gendo> (Also, for the record, the class is mostly Japanese.)

[18-Sep-2011 21:57:34]  <Cassie> Cassie tries to answer the questions as best she can, which leads to a lot of "Ums" and " I don't know" and various canned factoids about Canada.
[18-Sep-2011 21:57:35]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Come on, why does everyone in a mech anime turn emo?

[18-Sep-2011 22:01:20]  <Gendo> The students begin to ignore Lou and Motoko, who refuse to play along in the game, and channel more questions to Cassie, Jaqueline, and Loki.

[18-Sep-2011 22:03:22]  <Gendo> The girl is somewhat short, and doesn't even look in the direction of the crowd she's silencing.
[18-Sep-2011 22:03:31]  <Gendo> (No, this girl is nothing like Asuka)

[18-Sep-2011 22:05:29]  <Gendo> After the outburst, the girl doesn't say a thing.  About 3/4 of the crowd backs off, the remaining students can only blurt out a few mor questions before class starts again (fuck this shit)

[18-Sep-2011 22:07:16]  <Gendo> Lou: It's actually his surname.

[18-Sep-2011 22:07:19]  <Lou> [or is it gender neutral, and I should stop learning things from Naruto?]
[18-Sep-2011 22:07:27]  <Lou> [right.]
[18-Sep-2011 22:07:29]  <Gendo> And yeah, what Motoko said.

[18-Sep-2011 22:08:25]  <Gendo> "There's so many of you, so it's been especially bad."
[18-Sep-2011 22:08:34]  <Motoko> I wouldn't say "traditional"...
[18-Sep-2011 22:09:59]  <Loki_Weyland> "It's not that bad."
[18-Sep-2011 22:10:00]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> So, tell me a little about yourself, Hinny~
[18-Sep-2011 22:10:07]  <Gendo> "Well, maybe not.  It seemed like a fitting thing to say."  He chuckles to himself a bit.
[18-Sep-2011 22:10:10]  <Loki_Weyland> "Just blurt out random bullshit."

[18-Sep-2011 22:12:46]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( What? ))
[18-Sep-2011 22:13:05]  <Gendo> "That's some peculiar Japanese... Jaqueline, right?  Did you pick it up from anime or something"  
[18-Sep-2011 22:13:23]  <Gendo> (actually, I suppose it'd be Maquerel-san)
[18-Sep-2011 22:13:32]  <Gendo> (but that feels weird to type >.>)

[18-Sep-2011 22:14:34]  <Gendo> (Yeah, honorifics are not required)
[18-Sep-2011 22:14:46]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [it'd get tiresome, I agree and also had no idea up to now]
[18-Sep-2011 22:14:59]  <Lou> [so, lunch]
[18-Sep-2011 22:15:05]  <Gendo> Right, lunch!
[18-Sep-2011 22:15:20]  <Gendo> The cafeteria looks like, well, a cafeteria.
[18-Sep-2011 22:15:23]  <Motoko> 14I think I'm doing to start calling Jackie "de Stijl".

[18-Sep-2011 22:16:03]  <Motoko> Wow, that's a huge glass roof...
[18-Sep-2011 22:16:16]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( Why ;~; ))
[18-Sep-2011 22:16:19]  <Cassie> Cassie waits for the others to settle down to eat lunch before announcing her plan "We need to get out of here. I say we run for the front door"
[18-Sep-2011 22:16:42]  <Motoko> You really thought it was that bad...?
[18-Sep-2011 22:16:53]  <Lou> Why?
[18-Sep-2011 22:16:54]  <Loki_Weyland> "It's not that bad, Cassie."
[18-Sep-2011 22:17:12]  <Lou> ["define-fop". hee.]
[18-Sep-2011 22:17:22]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> ...
[18-Sep-2011 22:17:46]  <Motoko> I mean, two of us are apparently habitual attention seekers, but that's still a minority!
[18-Sep-2011 22:17:52]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel pulls Cassie into a weird hug. "If I sat you on my lap, would that make it all better~?"
[18-Sep-2011 22:17:59]  <Cassie> "You managed to avoid the gaggle of people by being quiet or talking like a Spanish person. I'm now the Canadian freak with anime hair!" Cassie tosses her hands up in the air "I'm still not exactly sure what anime is!"
[18-Sep-2011 22:18:15]  <Loki_Weyland> "We'll show you later."
[18-Sep-2011 22:18:32]  <Loki_Weyland> "What do you think we should start with? Gundam? Ghost in the Shell?"
[18-Sep-2011 22:18:36]  <Lou> If you keep not acting as "interesting" as Loki and Jacqueline, they'll forget about you quickly.
[18-Sep-2011 22:19:02]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I have to wonder if all this anime would still be written if the second impact happened.]
[18-Sep-2011 22:19:03]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Besides, not my fault you didn't slink over to Lou here.
[18-Sep-2011 22:19:05]  <Cassie> "But I wasn't acting. I was just answering their questions..."
[18-Sep-2011 22:19:28]  <Loki_Weyland> "I'll give you some pointers, then."
[18-Sep-2011 22:19:31]  <Lou> Right.  Just keep doing that.
[18-Sep-2011 22:19:34]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Hey, Loki, get her started ooooon... Bokurano!
[18-Sep-2011 22:19:39]  <Motoko> Just don't answer them, then. It's not like you're being interrogated.
[18-Sep-2011 22:19:40]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel grins evilly.
[18-Sep-2011 22:19:57]  <Loki_Weyland> "Nah, I say we start her off slow."
[18-Sep-2011 22:20:04]  <Motoko> 14Jaqueline_de_Maquerel: Would be from '07, post-Second Impact!
[18-Sep-2011 22:20:05]  <Lou> Well, maybe you shouldn't, if you're worried about revealing too much information...
[18-Sep-2011 22:20:22]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( In my headcanon, Bokurano is similar to NGE in NGE itself. :V ))
[18-Sep-2011 22:20:24]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I hope I haven't ruined your references, everyone :P]
[18-Sep-2011 22:20:49]  <Lou> [Cassie would like FLAG, obviously]
[18-Sep-2011 22:20:51]  <Loki_Weyland> "She's going to need the knowledge, dude."
[18-Sep-2011 22:21:18]  <Cassie> "They didn't ask questions about... extracurriculars. I just don't know why they care about what I did before and what I do after school." 
[18-Sep-2011 22:21:59]  <Loki_Weyland> "You're new, and thus interesting."
[18-Sep-2011 22:22:04]  <Lou> Because you're new, they assume that you're interesting, and that things you do are interesting.  Just make something up if you have t-
[18-Sep-2011 22:22:13]  * Lou stops, worried that he just agreed with Loki
[18-Sep-2011 22:22:18]  <Motoko> Maybe we should just take Cassie to Shibuya-3 over the weekend...
[18-Sep-2011 22:22:24]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki grins.
[18-Sep-2011 22:22:30]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Er, smiles.
[18-Sep-2011 22:22:38]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Showing teeth.
[18-Sep-2011 22:22:40]  <Lou> What is "Shibuya-3"?
[18-Sep-2011 22:22:48]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [that would be a grin, Loki_Weyland :P]
[18-Sep-2011 22:22:57]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Maybe.
[18-Sep-2011 22:23:45]  <Motoko> Lou, I thought you'd been living here for a while... you know, downtown? Fashion district, commercial center? Any of that ring a bell?
[18-Sep-2011 22:23:46]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> And like I said, if anyone harasses you, Cassie, they'd regret it immediately~

[18-Sep-2011 22:25:16]  <Gendo> While you are all discussing this, you notice a boy of relatively small stature, somewhat hunched, appears the nerdy, bullyable type approach.
[18-Sep-2011 22:25:18]  <Lou> Right.  Right.  Um, thanks.
[18-Sep-2011 22:25:20]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Jaqueline_de_Maquerel: I think I'll change the Bokurano reference to Ideon in the novelization, if that's OK.

[18-Sep-2011 22:27:13]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel is tempted to gnaw on Cassie's ear.

[18-Sep-2011 22:28:10]  <Cassie> "I heard on the internet that they are actually controlled by bears."
[18-Sep-2011 22:28:21]  <Lou> Some of our parents work on that project, so we had to move here for that.  That's all.
[18-Sep-2011 22:28:27]  <Loki_Weyland> "And we showed up the day after the incident, so I can see why people would make the connection."
[18-Sep-2011 22:28:32]  * Motoko stops talking to Lou to listen in, but doesn't turn to look at the boy
[18-Sep-2011 22:28:48]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Wait.
[18-Sep-2011 22:28:55]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki chuckles at Cassie's theory.

[18-Sep-2011 22:30:02]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: What a nice class rep, leaving the new people who got mobbed in class to their own devices...
[18-Sep-2011 22:30:19]  <Gendo> The kid looks slightly disappointed "Well, it you're not, that's fine too... I just thought it'd be cool if you were.  Sorry I asked..."
[18-Sep-2011 22:30:22]  <Gendo> He turns to leave.

[18-Sep-2011 22:31:41]  <Cassie> "You two are going to drag this game into our apartment aren't you?"
[18-Sep-2011 22:31:47]  <Loki_Weyland> "Hell yeah we are."

[18-Sep-2011 22:33:04]  <Loki_Weyland> "We're all best buds!" Loki reaches his arms around and tries to get as many of the group into a hug as possible.
[18-Sep-2011 22:33:06]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> "We're different, though. Normally, we'd stay with a family, but we're on a government program, so."
[18-Sep-2011 22:33:09]  * Lou drops his face into his palm...

[18-Sep-2011 22:33:28]  <Loki_Weyland> "Aw, you're no fun."
[18-Sep-2011 22:33:31]  * Lou locks up

[18-Sep-2011 22:33:45]  <Gendo> The kid looks equally uncomfortable.

[18-Sep-2011 22:41:40]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> He thought we were the pilots of those freaky mechs from the other ay.
[18-Sep-2011 22:41:42]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> *day
[18-Sep-2011 22:41:45]  <Gendo> "Oh, rumors.  They'll die down soon."
[18-Sep-2011 22:41:58]  *** Madoka <~chatzilla@S0106001a92b64fd8.no.shawcable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.6.15/20110303024726])
[18-Sep-2011 22:42:19]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki gets out his laptop and a flash drive. He types something, disconnects the drive, and puts it away.
[18-Sep-2011 22:42:22]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> How the heck... why would they rumor about us?
[18-Sep-2011 22:42:31]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel cocks an eyebrow, with a "are you serious" sort of grin.
[18-Sep-2011 22:42:37]  <Gendo> "Pilots?  Oh, that must've been Yuuki Ashikaga.  He's generally pretty quiet, but he's really exciteable when it come to robots."
[18-Sep-2011 22:42:38]  <Loki_Weyland> "Because we showed up the day after the robots did."
[18-Sep-2011 22:42:53]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> I mean, it could have been some cops or military guys or something... what, is this the only high school in Tokyo?
[18-Sep-2011 22:43:00]  <Motoko> 14Shouldn't we have had to perform a deception check at some point...?
[18-Sep-2011 22:43:06]  <Gendo> "You're new, new is interesting.  The robots are new, robots are interesting.  It's simple math, at this point."
[18-Sep-2011 22:43:10]  <Loki_Weyland> "Oh, that reminds me. When we have our MechWarrior game, we'll have to drag Osip into it somehow."
[18-Sep-2011 22:43:32]  <Gendo> Motoko: Probably.  I forgot about it, and it's too late to retcon now.
[18-Sep-2011 22:43:57]  <Lou> [I used my metagaming deception skill to avoid a deception check, Motoko!]
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:06]  <Cassie> Cassie waits for Lou to come back and the mentions her idea of heading back to the classroom to avoid cafetria hecklers.
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:07]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Yeah, but... that's kind of a leap o logic.
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:12]  <Gendo> "This isn't the only high school in Tokyo-3, but it's the largest.  The others are private schools, with high tuition and such.
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:12]  <Motoko> 14Lou: Well, you weren't even saying anything, so...
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:14]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Well, not really. Do all these kids watch anime?
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:14]  <Gendo> "
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:24]  <Lou> [Motoko: The perfect crime]
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:26]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [the only way to avoid giving out information is to not say anything at all~]
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:26]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> If so, I shouldn't be surprised they'd think we're the pilots...
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:32]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER. ))
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:53]  <Motoko> 14Osip_Zhgun[Barcode], even silence may betray you.
[18-Sep-2011 22:44:53]  * Lou comes back with a meal mostly consisting of rice and rice byproducts.
[18-Sep-2011 22:45:02]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [ :o ]
[18-Sep-2011 22:45:10]  <Gendo> (Oh, unrelated but before I forget:  I'll be writing up the press conference with Colonel Shizuko sometime before the next session)
[18-Sep-2011 22:45:12]  <Motoko> Lou, Cassie and I were about to go back to the classroom. Do you want to come with us?
[18-Sep-2011 22:45:25]  <Lou> [Not if we turn over silence to the NKVD before they can betray us!]
[18-Sep-2011 22:45:36]  <Lou> Oh  Yes, yes, sure.
[18-Sep-2011 22:45:41]  * Lou glances at Loki and Jacqueline warily
[18-Sep-2011 22:45:48]  <Motoko> 14Gendo, 4:00 is an absolute end for me, so I've about 15 minutes.
[18-Sep-2011 22:45:50]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [warily or wearily?]
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:07]  <Lou> [warily]
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:10]  <Loki_Weyland> "Guys, I think there was something bad in my food."
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:19]  <Cassie> [The thought of leaving those two alone? Both]
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:32]  <Gendo> Hinata: "Ah, you can find your way back without me, yes?  I'd like to thoroughly enjoy my lunch".
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:36]  <Gendo> Motoko: Yeah, that's fine.
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:38]  <Motoko> 14Exeunt MOTOKO, CASSIE, and LOU.
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:39]  <Loki_Weyland> "I think I'll find my way to the nurse's office."
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:40]  <Lou> [Well, they've got the yakuza with them, they can't do too much damage.]
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:49]  <Gendo> Motoko: We can probably wrap it up, too.
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:51]  <Lou> Y-yes, thank you, Mr. President.
[18-Sep-2011 22:46:55]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel follows.
[18-Sep-2011 22:47:05]  * Lou exits
[18-Sep-2011 22:47:32]  <Gendo> Lunch is over.
[18-Sep-2011 22:47:48]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki gets up and walks out of the cafeteria, toward the nurses office, which happens to be in the same direction as the offices.
[18-Sep-2011 22:47:55]  <Loki_Weyland> *nurse's office
[18-Sep-2011 22:48:10]  <Gendo> (Honestly, I think that really is about how much I had to get through.  An introduction NPCs, and the press thing, really.)
[18-Sep-2011 22:48:41]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki looks in the offices to see if there's anyone there.
[18-Sep-2011 22:48:41]  <Lou> [And we already have an exciting cast of crazy creepazoids to deal with!  Yay!]
[18-Sep-2011 22:48:54]  <Cassie> [Oh wow, imagine leaving this maladjusted children(save Motoko, she's sane) to an actual press conference)
[18-Sep-2011 22:48:55]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [A shame we missed the chewing-out for our job on the first Angel, but I'm sure we'll be fine without that.]
[18-Sep-2011 22:49:12]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Gendo: Is there anyone in the office?
[18-Sep-2011 22:49:17]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [maybe I can let you all know how it goes~]
[18-Sep-2011 22:49:25]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Cassie would stab a reporter.
[18-Sep-2011 22:49:30]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Er, Jaq would.
[18-Sep-2011 22:49:32]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> :V
[18-Sep-2011 22:49:50]  <Motoko> 14Are we calling it quits for today, then?
[18-Sep-2011 22:49:58]  <Loki_Weyland> $ I'm not done yet!
[18-Sep-2011 22:50:04]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [considering you guys already almost basically said "pleased to meet oyu, we're the pilots and we work for NERV, I'll just be on my way"... ]
[18-Sep-2011 22:50:14]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [ :P ]
[18-Sep-2011 22:50:25]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: Yes, the nurse's office is populated by the nurse, plus a couple of students resting.  A couple actually look sick
[18-Sep-2011 22:50:26]  <Gendo> .
[18-Sep-2011 22:50:46]  <Motoko> 14I *think* I could pretend to have been a normal transfer student just caught up in this mess. This Deceive skill may turn up handy!
[18-Sep-2011 22:50:47]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki quietly exits, and pulls the fire alarm.
[18-Sep-2011 22:50:57]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> ...
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:02]  <Lou> [haha wat]
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:10]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Goddammit, Loki....
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:18]  <Gendo> Motoko: If I forget something like that, remind me if you catch it.  Don't assume that I know exactly what I'm doing :P
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:23]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( Remember, Jaq knows he's a trickster! ))
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:27]  <Motoko> 14Okay, Gendo, Loki_Weyland's *definitely* going to have to roll a check for that.
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:34]  <Motoko> 14Silent Move, maybe?
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:35]  <Cassie> With barely restrained glee Cassie says "Oh no a fire. We totally have to leave school now."
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:44]  <Gendo> Motoko: Yeah, agreed.
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:46]  <Lou> [Hey, hey, he's right, slow down]
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:56]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki then slips into the office and gets out his flash drive.
[18-Sep-2011 22:51:58]  <Lou> [no wait, if it's silent move he'll hit the fire alarm regardless]
[18-Sep-2011 22:52:06]  <Lou> [hey.  make a check, kemosabe]
[18-Sep-2011 22:52:13]  <Gendo> Lou:  But people will notice him.
[18-Sep-2011 22:52:14]  <Cassie> [NVM waiting to see if that actually happened]
[18-Sep-2011 22:52:16]  <Lou> [oh hey, guess what, CHICKENS]
[18-Sep-2011 22:52:18]  <Motoko> 14Lou: Check whether a teacher catches him, etc.
[18-Sep-2011 22:52:30]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: Yup, Silent Move check.
[18-Sep-2011 22:52:44]  <Loki_Weyland> $ What do I roll?
[18-Sep-2011 22:52:45]  <Gendo> Which, since you don't have the skill, is a 1d100, geting below your agility.
[18-Sep-2011 22:52:50]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Ah.
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:00]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: It's d100, below agility / 2
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:02]  <Loki_Weyland> !roll d100
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:02]  <GameServ> 48 == 48
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:06]  <Loki_Weyland> $ SHIT.
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:10]  <Gendo> Motoko: Oh, even better.
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:16]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: If you have the skill, you don't get the /2 penalty is all.
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:24]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [quick spend a fate point]
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:31]  <Loki_Weyland> $ I'll do that, yeah.
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:34]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [well wait]
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:37]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [you could fail by more degrees, too~]
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:48]  <Loki_Weyland> $ So what does that get me? A re-roll?
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:49]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( You are in so much trouble, young man. ))
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:56]  <Motoko> 14pfffhahahaha. Loki_Weyland, you are aware you have a 15% chance of success
[18-Sep-2011 22:53:58]  <Gendo> I think that's a reroll.
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:02]  <Cassie> [Lets hope for a natural 100]
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:02]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Fate points are rerolls, yeh]
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:08]  <Loki_Weyland> !roll d100
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:08]  <GameServ> 46 == 46
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:15]  <Loki_Weyland> $ ...
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:16]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [snerk]
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:20]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( lololol ))
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:22]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Can I use another one?
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:23]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: As soon as you try leaving the office, the nurse stops you.  "Can I help you with something?"  (I'm totally being nice right now)
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:37]  <Loki_Weyland> "Ah, yeah."
[18-Sep-2011 22:54:53]  <Loki_Weyland> "I think there was something in the food that didn't agree with me."
[18-Sep-2011 22:55:09]  <Motoko> 14So even with three fate points, that's four rolls = .15 + .85 * .15 + .85^2 * .15 + .85^3 * .15 < 48%
[18-Sep-2011 22:55:12]  <Gendo> Motoko: If you need to leave, I think we'll pretty much end this session after this scene is done.
[18-Sep-2011 22:55:20]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I think you can only reroll once in each case.]
[18-Sep-2011 22:55:25]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [in each case you wat ar eroll*]
[18-Sep-2011 22:55:55]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: "Oh, yeah, cafeteria food will do that sometimes if you're not used to it.  Would you like to rest a bit?  We have a spare bed."
[18-Sep-2011 22:56:02]  <Loki_Weyland> "Sure, thanks."
[18-Sep-2011 22:56:56]  <Gendo> (Anything else?)
[18-Sep-2011 22:57:18]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki waits for a bit to see if the nurse will leave.
[18-Sep-2011 22:57:26]  <Loki_Weyland> Is there a computer in the office?
[18-Sep-2011 22:57:35]  <Gendo> She looks thoroughly involved with paperwork.
[18-Sep-2011 22:57:58]  <Gendo> And no, there isn't, save for the one that at the nurse's currently occupied desk.
[18-Sep-2011 22:58:28]  <Motoko> 14Okay, I'm checking out for now. Let me know how Loki_Weyland's escapades go later...
[18-Sep-2011 22:58:35]  <Gendo> K.
[18-Sep-2011 22:58:35]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki thinks for a bit.
[18-Sep-2011 22:58:36]  <Gendo> Bye.
[18-Sep-2011 22:58:42]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Should I mention what Loki's trying to do?
[18-Sep-2011 22:58:53]  <Gendo> Sure?
[18-Sep-2011 22:59:05]  <Lou> [ah]
[18-Sep-2011 22:59:07]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( Later. ))
[18-Sep-2011 22:59:09]  <Lou> [we're still going?]
[18-Sep-2011 22:59:13]  <Loki_Weyland> $ He's trying to put a keylogger on the network.
[18-Sep-2011 22:59:15]  <Gendo> Lou: I guess.
[18-Sep-2011 22:59:24]  <Loki_Weyland> $ The Fire alarm was to get everyone out of the office.
[18-Sep-2011 22:59:31]  <Motoko> 14That's definitely an advanced skill, Loki_Weyland!
[18-Sep-2011 22:59:38]  <Lou> [Why would you want to keylog a school?]
[18-Sep-2011 22:59:43]  <Lou> [And yeah, need moar skill checks]
[18-Sep-2011 23:00:08]  <Loki_Weyland> $ To find out dirt on people. In specific, he's wary about the class rep's "connections".
[18-Sep-2011 23:00:11]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: Yeah, looking at your character sheet, there's only a /very/ slim chance you can pull that off.
[18-Sep-2011 23:00:36]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( It's probably a very basic keylogger. Most schools have shit security. Especially public ones. ))
[18-Sep-2011 23:00:51]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Roll for Awareness: Realizing he's not good enough to pull this off? :P]
[18-Sep-2011 23:01:01]  <Loki_Weyland> $ As for the keylogger, he's a script kiddie. I seriously doubt he'd be able to write that thing himself.
[18-Sep-2011 23:01:09]  <Gendo> Yeah, I figured.
[18-Sep-2011 23:01:26]  <Lou> [Even if you use someone else's keylogger, it's nontrivial to be able to use it effectively and things.]
[18-Sep-2011 23:01:48]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( I remember some really angry RPer trying to hack a major comic book board's site after we laughed her out of a game. There's crack packs like that everywhere, if you know where to look. ))
[18-Sep-2011 23:02:04]  <Gendo> Still, everything that would be required to pull it off, I don't think it'll be happening today.
[18-Sep-2011 23:02:13]  <Loki_Weyland> After deliberation, Loki decides that he shouldn't try anything right now. He could probably install it right now by asking the nurse, but that'd leave a very visible trail.
[18-Sep-2011 23:02:46]  <Lou> [also wait, does Loki just carry around a keylogger in case he runs into mafiosos?]
[18-Sep-2011 23:03:02]  <Loki_Weyland> $ He has a flash drive and a laptop with him. That's why he got it out earlier.
[18-Sep-2011 23:03:05]  <Lou> [now I want to do that]
[18-Sep-2011 23:03:21]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [mafiosi*]
[18-Sep-2011 23:03:40]  <Lou> [fuck your talians]
[18-Sep-2011 23:03:54]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [he coulda maybe downloaded it off the internet]
[18-Sep-2011 23:04:00]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [though that's also kinda traily]
[18-Sep-2011 23:04:11]  <Loki_Weyland> A short while passes, and Loki gets up. "I think I'm feeling better now, thanks. I'll go back to class now."
[18-Sep-2011 23:04:25]  <Gendo> "All right.  Feel free to come back if it gets worse".
[18-Sep-2011 23:04:40]  <Lou> [information warfare would sure be fun(ny), though~!]
[18-Sep-2011 23:04:46]  <Loki_Weyland> $ And yeah, he downloaded it off the internet a while ago. He's used it before, he just doesn't know a thing about programming."
[18-Sep-2011 23:05:40]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Where were you, Loki?
[18-Sep-2011 23:05:53]  <Loki_Weyland> "Nurse's office. The food didn't sit well with me."
[18-Sep-2011 23:06:35]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel raises an eyebrow. "It's better than stuff from yankland... or some schools in China."
[18-Sep-2011 23:08:11]  <Loki_Weyland> "American school food is about as good as a prison meal, I say."
[18-Sep-2011 23:08:17]  <Gendo> I think I'm going to end the session now.  I wasn't going to play through afterschool until after I run Osip's thing, and write out the press release.
[18-Sep-2011 23:08:38]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Sure.
[18-Sep-2011 23:08:43]  <Loki_Weyland> $ ENTERING META NOW.
[18-Sep-2011 23:08:45]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [S'fine by me.]
[18-Sep-2011 23:08:54]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Assuming direct meta]
[18-Sep-2011 23:08:56]  <Gendo> Alrighty then.  
[18-Sep-2011 23:09:04]  <Gendo> -END OF SESSION-
[18-Sep-2011 23:09:17]  <Gendo> Introduced 4 new NPCs.
[18-Sep-2011 23:09:30]  <Gendo> Made some progress on plot (not really)
