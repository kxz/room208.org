@time=2012-01-25T06:19:25.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I don't even need security clearance to see that you're underage?
@time=2012-01-25T06:21:12.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :What difference does it make to you, Lou? You're just as underage.
@time=2012-01-25T06:22:37.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I meant "I" as "anyone".
@time=2012-01-25T06:24:18.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It's all just archival data now anyway.
@time=2012-01-25T06:24:33.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :That world is over.
@time=2012-01-25T06:24:52.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Onto the next.
@time=2012-01-25T06:25:07.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It didn't hurt this time.  That's good.  And you're still here, even.
@time=2012-01-25T06:28:21.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I'm surprised you made it as well.
@time=2012-01-25T06:29:19.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I should be thankful I can share my burdens with someone else who has no universe to call home.
@time=2012-01-25T06:29:38.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Oh, you haven't gone through this before?
@time=2012-01-25T06:31:18.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :No.
@time=2012-01-25T06:31:24.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :And I'd rather not do it again.
@time=2012-01-25T06:33:15.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :How strange.  I wonder what you are, then.
@time=2012-01-25T06:34:36.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :What do you mean?
@time=2012-01-25T06:36:02.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Well.  Nothing else major has reappeared before.  Certainly nothing alive.  And this void is new as well.  Maybe they erase my memory.
@time=2012-01-25T06:39:03.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Do you think this makes me... different, somehow?
@time=2012-01-25T06:39:12.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Probably.
@time=2012-01-25T06:39:28.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I don't know. I'm even less aware of what's happening to me than you are.
@time=2012-01-25T06:39:37.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I'd wondered that anyway.
@time=2012-01-25T06:42:10.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :How much I knew?
@time=2012-01-25T06:42:32.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :If you were different.
@time=2012-01-25T06:43:34.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Hm. I guess it was a stupid question. Of course I'm different.
@time=2012-01-25T06:43:48.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Everyone else is gone, but I'm still here, and you're still here, wherever "here" is.
@time=2012-01-25T06:44:04.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :So that makes us different. In that kind of superficial sense.
@time=2012-01-25T06:44:18.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :They could be in some other "here".
@time=2012-01-25T06:44:50.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :But it's not ours, is it?
@time=2012-01-25T06:45:38.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :"ours", huh.  Well, no.
@time=2012-01-25T06:46:52.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Yeah. Just us.
@time=2012-01-25T06:47:24.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :ACTION bites her lip, looking down at her feet
@time=2012-01-25T06:48:49.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Something wrong?  Other than being mostly alone in a void.
@time=2012-01-25T06:49:39.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Mostly just that.
@time=2012-01-25T06:50:18.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :And, well, the things that come from being mostly alone, instead of just alone.
@time=2012-01-25T06:51:47.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :ACTION smirks.  "Yes, that's new for me as well."
@time=2012-01-25T06:52:00.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I wouldn't worry.  They can't have much use in doing this for long.
@time=2012-01-25T06:52:32.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :But what if it's not them?
@time=2012-01-25T06:52:38.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :What if this just *is*? What then?
@time=2012-01-25T06:53:47.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :ACTION stares, then looks away
@time=2012-01-25T06:53:53.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :That wouldn't explain everything before.
@time=2012-01-25T06:54:34.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I've learned that some things just don't have an explanation.
@time=2012-01-25T06:55:08.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Maybe not yet.
@time=2012-01-25T06:55:53.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :No, not even then.
@time=2012-01-25T06:56:17.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You haven't waited long enough.
@time=2012-01-25T06:56:25.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :We try to come up with stories after the fact to make things make sense to us, but in the end, sometimes, events are just random.
@time=2012-01-25T06:57:51.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I should know. What happened to Tomoko was like that.
@time=2012-01-25T06:59:00.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Things don't just happen.  People make things happen.
@time=2012-01-25T06:59:46.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Not the things that happened to her.
@time=2012-01-25T06:59:57.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Nobody could have just done that.
@time=2012-01-25T07:01:27.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :They can do anything.
@time=2012-01-25T07:01:30.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :What is Tomoko.
@time=2012-01-25T07:04:22.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I guess I should explain...
@time=2012-01-25T07:04:31.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :ACTION takes an uneven breath
@time=2012-01-25T07:09:11.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I don't think I've talked much about my family since... well, you know.
@time=2012-01-25T07:09:23.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I don't.
@time=2012-01-25T07:09:45.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Ever, really.
@time=2012-01-25T07:09:59.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :At least not with you.
@time=2012-01-25T07:10:03.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You made up that story about your grandmother.
@time=2012-01-25T07:10:31.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I did, yeah.
@time=2012-01-25T07:11:51.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :My grandmother just lives out in the country. The one that's still alive. On my mom's side.
@time=2012-01-25T07:12:12.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :But that's another story. For some other time.
@time=2012-01-25T07:12:43.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :What I meant is that I'm an only child.
@time=2012-01-25T07:13:00.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :No brothers, no sisters.
@time=2012-01-25T07:13:24.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Okay.
@time=2012-01-25T07:14:04.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :But I almost had one. A sister.
@time=2012-01-25T07:14:33.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Thus the anagram.
@time=2012-01-25T07:14:47.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Right. She never got a real name. It's just what I called her.
@time=2012-01-25T07:15:00.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :14Motoko confirmed for alternate universe PKD
@time=2012-01-25T07:15:01.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :She was... my twin. Literally my twin.
@time=2012-01-25T07:16:55.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :But... I think it was four or five months into the pregnancy. Something went wrong.
@time=2012-01-25T07:18:20.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I think they call it a vanishing twin. She died, and just... disappeared.
@time=2012-01-25T07:19:19.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :The medical explanation is that the fetus gets reabsorbed by the surviving twin. Something like that.
@time=2012-01-25T07:21:39.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :My mother told me this when I was eleven. I don't remember why. She was -- distraught.
@time=2012-01-25T07:23:37.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Ever since then, I occasionally see her in my dreams, the sister I never had. She'll comfort me and tell me everything is all right but behind it all I can feel this... jealousy, this hatred, this resentment, like she wants to take my place and give me hers.
@time=2012-01-25T07:24:29.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :And I ask myself if she's really wrong to feel that way.
@time=2012-01-25T07:25:24.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :So... that's my story.
@time=2012-01-25T07:26:24.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Are you thinking that she's taken your place?
@time=2012-01-25T07:27:09.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I didn't even think about it that way.
@time=2012-01-25T07:27:45.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It was just... what happened to Tomoko pretty much embodied randomness for me.
@time=2012-01-25T07:28:11.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :There's no explanation beyond her being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
@time=2012-01-25T07:28:37.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :They wanted you to have someone in your dreams.  I don't know.
@time=2012-01-25T07:28:53.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You think they have all this power?
@time=2012-01-25T07:29:06.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Well, maybe. It might be easier to swallow.
@time=2012-01-25T07:30:28.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Sorry if I depressed you or anything. It's not the most uplifting story, I know.
@time=2012-01-25T07:31:37.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :But, you know, movies always taught me that when two people are trapped someplace together, they either share their stories, or one of them confesses to the other.
@time=2012-01-25T07:32:03.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :And I'm not really gunning for the latter. No offense.
@time=2012-01-25T07:32:18.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :None taken.
@time=2012-01-25T07:32:59.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I already think they have enough control to kill your sister in the womb just to make you feel things.  It's hardly going to depress me.
@time=2012-01-25T07:33:56.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :ACTION nods
@time=2012-01-25T07:34:46.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :If they did, it worked.
@time=2012-01-25T07:35:01.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It worked really well.
@time=2012-01-25T07:36:22.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :They made me me, and you you, for whatever reasons... and stories, huh.  What kind of story can I share.
@time=2012-01-25T07:36:57.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :What do you think of this thought of mine?  It's not normal.
@time=2012-01-25T07:37:34.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Which one?
@time=2012-01-25T07:37:45.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Then.
@time=2012-01-25T07:37:47.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :*Them.
@time=2012-01-25T07:38:19.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I don't really know.
@time=2012-01-25T07:39:00.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Some people believe in a God that works like they do to you.
@time=2012-01-25T07:39:25.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :He plans everything, and it all happens for a certain reason.
@time=2012-01-25T07:40:31.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It's just not a reason that we can comprehend.
@time=2012-01-25T07:40:53.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :God is supposed to be nice.
@time=2012-01-25T07:41:11.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :There's a saying I think you know. "God works in mysterious ways."
@time=2012-01-25T07:42:12.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I thought they put that in to mock me.
@time=2012-01-25T07:42:29.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Maybe they're working for some good none of us understand.
@time=2012-01-25T07:42:44.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It's all beyond me. So I call it random.
@time=2012-01-25T07:44:39.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Sometimes it makes sense.  Sometimes it doesn't.  I've tried to understand.
@time=2012-01-25T07:44:43.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Oh.  I know a story.
@time=2012-01-25T07:44:55.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :One time they just left me alone.
@time=2012-01-25T07:45:32.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I hope that's not the whole story.
@time=2012-01-25T07:45:36.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :ACTION giggles
@time=2012-01-25T07:45:41.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Very funny.
@time=2012-01-25T07:45:59.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Sorry. I couldn't resist.
@time=2012-01-25T07:46:15.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :There was a base.  Empty of people, like it had been abandoned for months.  Locked exits, but enough supplies to let me live indefinitely.
@time=2012-01-25T07:46:22.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I guess we could use humor about now.
@time=2012-01-25T07:47:23.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Everything was all prepped to go, though.  So I went, because that's what they always want me to do.  Us.
@time=2012-01-25T07:47:37.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Us?
@time=2012-01-25T07:48:00.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I usually think of pilots as being just me, but you're new.
@time=2012-01-25T07:48:27.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :So us. People who are told to go, and who go.
@time=2012-01-25T07:48:46.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :They didn't even have to tell me directly.  I guess they were just making sure I was trained.
@time=2012-01-25T07:50:21.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :And they just left you there?
@time=2012-01-25T07:51:38.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Yes.
@time=2012-01-25T07:52:29.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It was quiet.  I tried to map the base, but they always change it anyway.
@time=2012-01-25T07:56:52.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It didn't make any sense to me at the time.  I guess that's why I thought of it.
@time=2012-01-25T07:57:23.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Did you ever find out why they did it?
@time=2012-01-25T07:58:24.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Like I said, I think it was just to see how well trained I was.  That they could order me without ordering.
@time=2012-01-25T08:01:07.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I'm not really sure what to say.
@time=2012-01-25T08:01:44.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Mm.  It's just further casting against the forces of movie clichÃ©s.
@time=2012-01-25T08:03:44.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Maybe now they'll yell "cut!" and throw all the lights back on and pull all the cameras out of hiding.
@time=2012-01-25T08:04:21.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :They'll look at you and ask something like "Didn't you read the script?" And you'll say you didn't, and get in an argument with the director.
@time=2012-01-25T08:04:34.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :And you?
@time=2012-01-25T08:06:39.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Wander to the trailer and sneak a donut while no one is looking.
@time=2012-01-25T08:07:28.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I guess opportunism would work better...
@time=2012-01-25T08:10:57.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :14Bedtime plus, oh, three hours.
