This is the third day that he brings the somewhat small, square-based cardboard box with him to the lunch room; his previous scoutings through the intermediary[?] halls proved fruitless. This time, about halfway to the break room, he spots the teenager in one of the side halls.

[09-Oct-2011 05:05:17]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip somewhat quickens his pace. "Well. I have played it myself, though in no extensive capacity. Where I have come from there was little interest and fewer opponents." Having peeled the tape, he slings one arm under the box to prevent it from falling, and slides the top half of the case over. The hinge prevents it from flying off onto the floor. [another message incoming]

[09-Oct-2011 05:12:41]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Within the box is a thin, wooden chessboard. Plastic playing pieces are enclosed within stiff plastic bags. The entire package appears to be fairly cheap. A three-panel, paper beginner's manual sits under the two bags. "In that case, would you be interested in a game? I don't believe we have nearly enough time over these half-hour lunches, but there are simple ways to play over a longer period of time…"

He looks for a surface to set the table down on.

[09-Oct-2011 05:32:59]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "If we are being refused information on one another, then NERV would likely take issue with us going to each others' residencies after hours." The hallway is empty save for a short bar stool; whatever sense of privacy the child may have been seeking would evidently be found here. Osip leans to set the flimsy board onto the stool and begins opening the bags of pieces.
[09-Oct-2011 05:33:50]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Alternatively we could meet here to exchange moves, but that again requires a second board. Not that it would be difficult to requisition one, considering the potential cost of this one."
[09-Oct-2011 05:34:10]  <Lou> Did they order you not to... talk, be near me?
[09-Oct-2011 05:34:14]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> considering how much this one could have possibly cost them*

[09-Oct-2011 05:43:37]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip pauses. "Not…explicitly. But I do not believe they intended me to meet you just yet, and they certainly do not want me to know anything about you." Osip sets the pieces onto the board. "Though you seem to be doing a good enough job of preventing me from achieving that regardless," he quips.

[09-Oct-2011 05:44:45]  <Lou> And I'm sorry, I'm not used to people talking to me before it starts.
[09-Oct-2011 05:46:56]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip nods and turns the table gently, having set it perpendicular to its proper orientation. He moves a pawn forward. " "...It?" "
[09-Oct-2011 05:47:34]  <Lou> ...   I said that wrong.  Before I'm needed.
[09-Oct-2011 05:47:54]  * Lou moves to kneeling, and then mirrors Osip's move.

[09-Oct-2011 05:54:12]  <Lou> [we probably shouldn't narrate the chess game, really, it would be confusing]
[09-Oct-2011 05:54:23]  <Lou> [and I think we already messed up the opening]
[09-Oct-2011 05:54:31]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [nobody said we were experienced~]
[09-Oct-2011 05:54:54]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I'm just trying ot think of something reasonable for osip to ask, not trying to assemble a chess play :P]
[09-Oct-2011 05:57:00]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip moves another pawn. "For that matter I have not learned much about the Evangelion. They were particularly snide in informing me that information on /that/ was not classified, but I never really bothered to read into them. Too much unpacking." [1/2]
[09-Oct-2011 05:57:57]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> into it*
[09-Oct-2011 05:59:49]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> He sits back slightly, though sitting on the floor leaves him little option to straighten up without putting his hands on the floor. "I assume you work with it for most of your days around here, as I do with the T-RIDEN-T." The acronymic name is only made more jarring through his accent. "Not particularly relaxing, operating a vehicle all day…"
[09-Oct-2011 06:01:18]  <Lou> No, it isn't very pleasant.  Though...
[09-Oct-2011 06:01:36]  <Lou> The combat simulations do have some advantage.  You don't have to think about anything but the target, for once.
[09-Oct-2011 06:01:38]  * Lou moves a piece

[09-Oct-2011 06:08:21]  <JackMackerel> (( Your health is better than the RP as of now! Besides, forcing yourself to write just makes the quality worse. ))

[09-Oct-2011 06:09:49]  <JackMackerel> (( tl;dr: gotobedclown.jpg if you're sick and tired. ))
[09-Oct-2011 06:10:09]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Combat is /easier/? Interesting…the T-RIDEN-T only becomes more cumbersome when aiming becomes a factor…" Osip is struck by intuition, winces slightly. "Or…wait. The pressure only becomes worse when you're /out/ of the cockpit, doesn't it?" He makes another move.
[09-Oct-2011 06:10:32]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [ JackMackerel: my incapacity to perform tasks is directly proportional to my will to do them! ]
[09-Oct-2011 06:10:48]  <Lou> Pressure?
[09-Oct-2011 06:10:54]  <Lou> [move, etc]
[09-Oct-2011 06:12:19]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Well. I imagine military life is difficult for a child." He speaks solemnly. "It is a shame what they are putting you through."
[09-Oct-2011 06:12:50]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [ I ACCELERATE ]
[09-Oct-2011 06:13:14]  <Lou> A shame.  Hm.
[09-Oct-2011 06:14:00]  <Lou> You must be used to it, Leytenant.
[09-Oct-2011 06:14:04]  <JackMackerel> (What a shame.)
[09-Oct-2011 06:14:12]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [ oh god, osip, a bomb! ]
[09-Oct-2011 06:14:14]  <Lou> [thinkin the same thing]
[09-Oct-2011 06:20:23]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip is unsure what to make of Lou's reaction. "Well. Conscription in Russia occurs at 18 for every able-bodied male. I have only been doing this for two years." A slightly abrupt stop is all that betrays his intent to share more. "Nonetheless, to be a Leytenant at my age required no small transitions." [1/2]
[09-Oct-2011 06:21:34]  <Lou> Oh.  What they've doing to me is mostly normal, then.
[09-Oct-2011 06:22:00]  * Lou freezes in the middle of placing a piece, for a few seconds, before resuming.
[09-Oct-2011 06:25:59]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip is taken off-guard but tries to hide his objection. Instead he makes another move, establishing a rudimentary defense. "There is no need for formalities. We are pilots; beyond all else we fight together. Please, you may call me Osip."
[09-Oct-2011 06:26:18]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [omgz could totally make cross-checks for deception if we wanted to be as pendantic as inhumanly possible]
[09-Oct-2011 06:26:42]  <Lou> Lou.
[09-Oct-2011 06:26:49]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> but, deciding it is for the best, tries to hide*
[09-Oct-2011 06:27:19]  * Lou stares at Osip a bit before returning eyes to the board.
[09-Oct-2011 06:29:35]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip smirks slightly as he finally hears the boy's name. He looks back at the board before he realizes the stare. [Should we call it here? say it's about 25 minutes into lunch, osip gets the idea to just write down the board layout for next time, exeunt all]
[09-Oct-2011 06:29:43]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> looks up and smirks slightly as*
[09-Oct-2011 06:29:57]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> before he notices the stare*
[09-Oct-2011 06:30:49]  <Lou> [If you want, Mr Zombie.]
[09-Oct-2011 06:31:09]  * Lou blushes a bit.  "It's not like I got to choose my name."
[09-Oct-2011 06:31:34]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [ Just seems appropriate given the DRAMATIC WEIGHT of the name drop. Also, as far as I know, fatigue isn't contagious! ]
[09-Oct-2011 06:34:12]  <Motoko> 14Blushes, Lou? Really?
[09-Oct-2011 06:34:19]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [ lou-guu~ ]

[09-Oct-2011 06:37:15]  <Lou> Mm.
[09-Oct-2011 06:37:37]  * Lou takes a notebook and pen from... a pocket?  and sketches the board.
[09-Oct-2011 06:37:52]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [ from an unseen orfice ]
[09-Oct-2011 06:38:07]  <JackMackerel> (hott)
[09-Oct-2011 06:38:22]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "…What are you writing?"
[09-Oct-2011 06:38:35]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> ["the board, dumbass"]
[09-Oct-2011 06:39:15]  * Lou shows Osip the sketch.  "Now you can put the pieces away.  Thank you, Leytenant Osip," he says, already standing up to leave
[09-Oct-2011 06:42:16]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip sees the sketch, and shakes his head as switches to a kneeling position. He starts gathering the pieces. "I should have imagined." He accelerates as the small plastic bits are gathered into the box, quickly returning the board to the cardboard box and shutting the flimsy case. "It is a pleasure. Should we meet again here, or…?"
[09-Oct-2011 06:42:41]  <Lou> Sure.
[09-Oct-2011 06:45:10]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip nods and stands. "Alright then. We will meet again tomorrow. Goodbye, Lou." He turns to leave, glancing once at the hole in the paint before he rounds the corner.
