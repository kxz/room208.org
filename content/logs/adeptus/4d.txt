[04-Nov-2011 06:26:30]  <Lout> hey, Motoko.  Eiri was looking for you.
[04-Nov-2011 06:26:38]  <Motoko> ... who?
[04-Nov-2011 06:27:03]  <Lout> The lab technician who hates his job.  He does the sync exams when that girl is out.
[04-Nov-2011 06:27:25]  <Lout> Are you feeling better?
[04-Nov-2011 06:27:42]  <Motoko> Than when?
[04-Nov-2011 06:28:17]  <Lout> When your persona bifurcate.  Which has happened a few times, I suppose.
[04-Nov-2011 06:28:41]  <Motoko> And how exactly would you expect me to be *aware* of that?
[04-Nov-2011 06:29:44]  <Lout> I don't know.  It could be an act.  Psychologists don't believe that identity disssociation is real, you know.
[04-Nov-2011 06:29:47]  <Lout> Not that you should trust them.
[04-Nov-2011 06:30:12]  <Motoko> That's their problem, not mine.
[04-Nov-2011 06:31:21]  <Lout> True enough.
[04-Nov-2011 06:32:07]  <Lout> You don't seem surprised by the suggestion that you are mentally abnormal?
[04-Nov-2011 06:32:22]  <Lout> That wasn't a question.  Sorry.
[04-Nov-2011 06:33:18]  <Motoko> Maybe, Lout, it's because, oh, I don't know, I get called a mental patient every other day in here?
[04-Nov-2011 06:33:48]  <Lout> Surely you have a stricter set of criteria by now.
[04-Nov-2011 06:34:10]  <Lout> Though I suppose most of us wouldn't really be considered insane.  Just unfit to live.
[04-Nov-2011 06:34:30]  <Motoko> I'm not in the armchair psychology business!
[04-Nov-2011 06:34:47]  <Lout> Do you lose time?
[04-Nov-2011 06:36:17]  <Motoko> Lout, I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
[04-Nov-2011 06:36:40]  <Lout> Why?
[04-Nov-2011 06:38:33]  <Motoko> I think I've talked quite enough about insanity for one day, thanks.
[04-Nov-2011 06:39:00]  <Lout> Very well.
[04-Nov-2011 06:39:32]  <Lout> That man still wanted to talk to you, though.  I guess you can put it off.
[04-Nov-2011 06:40:15]  <Motoko> If he was looking for me for reasons like this, it's probably better that I don't see him.
[04-Nov-2011 06:40:33]  <Lout> "Like this?"
[04-Nov-2011 06:40:43]  <Lout> This is just me asking questions, sorry.
[04-Nov-2011 06:40:49]  <Motoko> Psychowhatever.
[04-Nov-2011 06:42:09]  <Lout> Oh.  Well.  That's half of what they ever ask us, anyway...
[04-Nov-2011 06:43:20]  <Motoko> It's probably half of what this entire program is about.
[04-Nov-2011 06:43:34]  <Lout> You have no idea.
[04-Nov-2011 06:43:38]  <Motoko> I wouldn't be surprised if it were some twisted researcher's mental experiment.
[04-Nov-2011 06:44:01]  <Lout> ...quite
[04-Nov-2011 06:44:38]  <Lout> Oh.  By the way.  Do they let your friends respond?
[04-Nov-2011 06:44:42]  <Motoko> You sound like you know something about this...
[04-Nov-2011 06:44:57]  <Motoko> ...respond? To what?
[04-Nov-2011 06:45:12]  <Lout> Your messages.
[04-Nov-2011 06:45:28]  <Lout> They let Cassie go on that trip, but I suppose her friends aren't civilians, like yours
[04-Nov-2011 06:45:55]  <Motoko> I didn't even hear that she'd left...
[04-Nov-2011 06:46:31]  <Motoko> They haven't even let me talk to anyone outside for the past few days.
[04-Nov-2011 06:47:01]  <Lout> You'll learn to pay more attention to their "security" after a while.
[04-Nov-2011 06:47:27]  <Lout> yes, she did.  You should probably watch out for Jacqueline, on that note.
[04-Nov-2011 06:47:39]  <Motoko> As if I weren't already...
[04-Nov-2011 06:48:00]  <Motoko> Is she up to something else again?
[04-Nov-2011 06:48:51]  <Lout> It's just that now she has one less... target?
[04-Nov-2011 06:49:44]  <Motoko> Oh, right.
[04-Nov-2011 06:49:58]  <Motoko> Thanks for the tip...
[04-Nov-2011 06:51:07]  <Motoko> Do you know where Cassie's gone?
[04-Nov-2011 06:51:39]  <Lout> Some American base.  They won't say which, obviously, not that it would mean much to me.  Or you.
[04-Nov-2011 06:51:48]  <Lout> er.  Canadian.  I get those confused.
[04-Nov-2011 06:52:56]  <Motoko> So a stint back home?
[04-Nov-2011 06:53:07]  <Lout> yes.
[04-Nov-2011 06:53:21]  <Motoko> I envy her sometimes...
[04-Nov-2011 06:53:43]  <Lout> Why?  The two of you are the least broken.
[04-Nov-2011 06:54:02]  <Motoko> She just seems to fit in here so much better, while I'm... wait, broken?
[04-Nov-2011 06:54:45]  <Lout> I thought you didn't want to talk about "psychowhatever".
[04-Nov-2011 06:55:04]  <Lout> And of course she does!  She's been in this situation for her whole life.
[04-Nov-2011 06:55:34]  <Motoko> Yeah, maybe.
[04-Nov-2011 06:56:23]  <Motoko> I don't want to talk about that kind of... diagnosis type of thing, but I want to say something about how I feel, you know?
[04-Nov-2011 06:56:34]  <Lout> Okay.
[04-Nov-2011 06:57:18]  <Motoko> After all, I think my mom was right. You can't live for long with all your emotions bottled up.
[04-Nov-2011 06:57:41]  <Motoko> I'm sorry about my little... outburst earlier.
[04-Nov-2011 06:57:55]  <Motoko> I just needed to get it out.
[04-Nov-2011 06:58:13]  <Lout> Better here than on the battlefield.
[04-Nov-2011 06:59:53]  <Motoko> I think even then the techs would find some way to use it for offensive purposes.
[04-Nov-2011 07:00:27]  <Motoko> Some kind of superpower triggered by feeling emotionally overwhelmed.
[04-Nov-2011 07:00:36]  <Lout> ...I suppose that is their job.  But that seems far-fetched.
[04-Nov-2011 07:00:51]  <Motoko> Everything seems far-fetched here to me.
[04-Nov-2011 07:01:59]  <Lout> It's relative.  Even if it seems strange to you, it has its own set of strange rules, and I don't think those rules include that.
[04-Nov-2011 07:02:35]  <Lout> though.  That does raise the possibility that they're trying to break you.  Hm.
[04-Nov-2011 07:02:56]  <Motoko> Well, I don't know any of the rules. They could probably persuade me that they're divine messengers by the end of next week.
[04-Nov-2011 07:03:34]  <Motoko> And it's not like I don't have baggage of my own that I'm already having trouble dealing with...
[04-Nov-2011 07:04:46]  <Lout> You'll deal with it.  Or you won't, and continue being somewhat stressed.  Or it will be cut off by death.  Probably one of those.
[04-Nov-2011 07:05:06]  <Motoko> Optimistic, aren't you?
[04-Nov-2011 07:05:51]  <Lout> You're pretty negative yourself.
[04-Nov-2011 07:07:19]  <Motoko> Yeah, a little.
[04-Nov-2011 07:07:43]  <Motoko> Some of it's just sarcasm, don't worry.
[04-Nov-2011 07:08:29]  <Lout> Sarcasm is probably a healthier reaction than enjoying it.  Or some kind of sociopathy.  Or just acting normally.
[04-Nov-2011 07:09:49]  <Motoko> That's what I kept telling myself back home, that it was a way of coping with stress.
[04-Nov-2011 07:10:04]  <Motoko> I don't know if it really helps, but it makes me feel a little better.
[04-Nov-2011 07:11:00]  <Lout> I wouldn't know.
[04-Nov-2011 07:11:45]  <Motoko> It's not like anybody really knows, anyway.
[04-Nov-2011 07:11:58]  <Motoko> I can keep convincing myself that it's okay that way!
[04-Nov-2011 07:13:26]  <Lout> You're a very pragmatic person, miss Iwatani.  I'm glad they picked you instead of... I don't know.  More of Weyland.
[04-Nov-2011 07:14:11]  <Motoko> I think you're the first person who's ever called me that.
[04-Nov-2011 07:14:15]  <Motoko> "Pragmatic", I mean.
[04-Nov-2011 07:16:04]  <Lout> It could be that you're normal for your type, and I haven't met enough to realize this.  Or you could only say such things after an outburst.  Or you could conceal it most of the time, and are showing me for whatever reason.  Or any number of things.
[04-Nov-2011 07:17:25]  <Motoko> I think a lot of people back home thought I was just impulsive -- I guess that's not, strictly speaking, *false*, but...
[04-Nov-2011 07:18:31]  <Lout> You could need more than one adjective.
[04-Nov-2011 07:19:06]  * Motoko laughs
[04-Nov-2011 07:19:17]  * Lout tilts head
[04-Nov-2011 07:19:41]  <Motoko> That's the oddest way I've ever heard that phrased.
[04-Nov-2011 07:19:54]  <Lout> Heard what?
[04-Nov-2011 07:20:28]  <Motoko> ... *that*. I don't know how to put it, but that!
[04-Nov-2011 07:20:40]  <Motoko> You know, talking with you is kind of refreshing.
[04-Nov-2011 07:21:14]  <Lout> If you say so.
[04-Nov-2011 07:21:24]  <Lout> The same goes for you.  I hadn't met someone like you yet.
[04-Nov-2011 07:22:14]  <Motoko> It's... I don't know, you don't say what I expect you to say, but in a good way.
[04-Nov-2011 07:22:39]  <Motoko> Like... I have to really think about what I'm saying.
[04-Nov-2011 07:23:18]  <Lout> With expected things, it's easy to slip into practiced patterns.
[04-Nov-2011 07:23:53]  <Motoko> Exactly.
[04-Nov-2011 07:24:39]  <Motoko> The conversations we have are unique... special, because we don't do that.
[04-Nov-2011 07:24:51]  <Motoko> I don't think we could even if we tried.
[04-Nov-2011 07:25:31]  <Lout> That would be a strange thing to try.
[04-Nov-2011 07:25:52]  <Motoko> It would be, wouldn't it?
[04-Nov-2011 07:26:21]  <Lout> You could write out a conversation beforehand, then refuse to deviate from your script.  If you got it wrong, it would be pretty silly.  And it would be hard to avoid deviation at that point.
[04-Nov-2011 07:26:38]  *** JackMackerel is now known as Jack|Shower
[04-Nov-2011 07:27:00]  <Motoko> I'm not a very good actress, sorry to say.
[04-Nov-2011 07:27:09]  <Motoko> I always had trouble remembering lines...
[04-Nov-2011 07:27:31]  <Lout> It's something you can practice as well.
[04-Nov-2011 07:28:02]  <Motoko> I could, but I don't think I'm cut out for it.
[04-Nov-2011 07:28:25]  <Motoko> Maybe I'd do better at improv? I doubt there's a company on base, though...
[04-Nov-2011 07:29:38]  <Lout> I don't know what that means.  Anyway, you don't have to, of course.  It's just a hypothetical.  Humans can't force themselves to do that anyway.
[04-Nov-2011 07:30:02]  <Lout> Oh.  and.  You'll probably come up with a pattern for me if you don't die.  It just happens.
[04-Nov-2011 07:30:06]  <Lout> Or I don't die.
[04-Nov-2011 07:31:50]  <Motoko> Then we'll just have to make it out of this together, so I can find out.
[04-Nov-2011 07:32:11]  <Motoko> I know you probably can't promise me that you won't die, but...
[04-Nov-2011 07:33:05]  <Lout> I try not to.  It's painful.
[04-Nov-2011 07:34:31]  <Motoko> Can you at least promise me that you'll try your hardest to survive?
[04-Nov-2011 07:35:37]  <Lout> Of course.
[04-Nov-2011 07:35:51]  <Lout> You too.  Don't test for emotion-powered superabilities.
[04-Nov-2011 07:36:36]  <Lout> Maybe we can get Jacqueline to do that.
[04-Nov-2011 07:36:40]  * Motoko laughs
[04-Nov-2011 07:37:36]  <Motoko> Yeah, that sounds like a decent idea. I'll just make sure I get out of here alive.
[04-Nov-2011 07:37:51]  <Motoko> ... and thanks.
[04-Nov-2011 07:38:52]  <Lout> Same to you.
[04-Nov-2011 07:39:38]  <Jack|Shower> (( How so? Threaten to stab everyone? ))
[04-Nov-2011 07:40:28]  <Motoko> aa~h, the ringing in my ears is back. Maybe I didn't sleep that hangover off all the way...
[04-Nov-2011 07:40:57]  <Motoko> I'm going to head back to bed. See you later, Lou!
[04-Nov-2011 07:41:06]  <Lout> Goodbye, Motoko.
