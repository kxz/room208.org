[28-Aug-2011 19:15:10]  <Gendo> At about 8 o'clock, the phones in each of your rooms begin to ring.  
[28-Aug-2011 19:15:17]  <Gendo> (game is kind of starting now....)
[28-Aug-2011 19:15:30]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] picks it up. "Hello?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:15:32]  * Motoko swipes aimlessly at nightstand
[28-Aug-2011 19:15:32]  * Loki_Weyland is not a morning person.
[28-Aug-2011 19:15:38]  <Loki_Weyland> "Yeah?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:15:47]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [oh. 8 o clock. *After some rubbing at eyes, Osip picks up the phone.*]
[28-Aug-2011 19:15:58]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] and Loki_Weyland:  You hear an automated wake-up call.
[28-Aug-2011 19:15:59]  <Lou> "Yes, sir?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:16:04]  <Gendo> :P
[28-Aug-2011 19:16:18]  * Motoko slams hand down on phone as if it's an alarm clock
[28-Aug-2011 19:16:18]  <Cassie> Cassie rubs her eyes, still jetlagged from the plane trip and timezone differences
[28-Aug-2011 19:16:23]  <Loki_Weyland> I listen for a bit and put down the phone.
[28-Aug-2011 19:16:33]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] sighs and holds the speakerphone away fmor hsi ear, listening as he gains his bearings.
[28-Aug-2011 19:16:46]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [gendo: gotta roll for depression…do we have spacebar in here?]
[28-Aug-2011 19:16:53]  <Gendo> Oh, right.

[28-Aug-2011 19:17:19]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [one second while I calculate hours spent depressed]
[28-Aug-2011 19:17:23]  <Gendo> Huh.
[28-Aug-2011 19:17:40]  * JackMackerel picks up and answers. It's... oddly cheerful.
[28-Aug-2011 19:17:42]  <Gendo> Lou: (can we get spacebar in here?  PMing Esperbot doesn't work for me)
[28-Aug-2011 19:17:50]  * Motoko picks up phone and cradles it loosely around ear
[28-Aug-2011 19:17:54]  <Lou> [/me is watching Spacebar recompile]
[28-Aug-2011 19:18:01]  <Gendo> (thanks)
[28-Aug-2011 19:18:08]  <Gendo> Motoko: Same wakeup call.
[28-Aug-2011 19:18:08]  <Cassie> Cassie picks up the phone and listens.
[28-Aug-2011 19:18:29]  * Motoko hangs up the phone and begins drifting off again
[28-Aug-2011 19:18:35]  <Gendo> (I'm going to assume that, after said wakeup call, you go through the morning motions)
[28-Aug-2011 19:19:04]  <Gendo> (Except Motoko, it seems :P)
[28-Aug-2011 19:19:19]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]>  [solid assumptoin]
[28-Aug-2011 19:19:29]  <Loki_Weyland> I'm up now, with a bit of a morning headache.
[28-Aug-2011 19:19:32]  * JackMackerel places the phone back in the receiver and goes back to sharpening her knives, singing old jody calls and zoning out at nothing.
[28-Aug-2011 19:19:56]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [hours are 1d5 + degrees of failure. WP is 40, test was 66 - so, 2 + the following 1d5 roll]

[28-Aug-2011 19:20:15]  <Gendo> (Also, going to mention that it all occurs to you that today is your first official day at NERV, so wearing the NERV uniforms provided for you is probably a good idea >.>  Just felt I should clarify.)
[28-Aug-2011 19:20:34]  <Motoko> 14I'm assuming that you're not just going to let me go back to bed...
[28-Aug-2011 19:21:43]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] dresses as is appropriate. An uncomfortable dream had put him back in the days past in his refugee camp and he is feeling particularly muddy today.
[28-Aug-2011 19:21:51]  * Loki_Weyland puts on the uniform, and checks the number of pockets.
[28-Aug-2011 19:22:14]  <Gendo> After about a half hour (or whatever length of time is reasonable for people to shower/clean themselves up), there is a knock at each of your doors.
[28-Aug-2011 19:22:46]  <Gendo> And actually, Motoko's door is the one knocked upon first.
[28-Aug-2011 19:22:48]  <Loki_Weyland> Yeah?
[28-Aug-2011 19:22:50]  * Motoko jerks awake at the sound of knocking
[28-Aug-2011 19:23:01]  <Loki_Weyland> $Whoops, guess my turn comes a bit later.
[28-Aug-2011 19:23:03]  * Lou opens door
[28-Aug-2011 19:23:04]  <Gendo> (sorry, I'm winging this bit)
[28-Aug-2011 19:23:06]  <Cassie> Cassie spends ten minutes brushing her teeth, before putting on her NERV uniform with a spare toothbrush nestled in the pocket.
[28-Aug-2011 19:23:31]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] sombrely opens his door, careful to see who it is before choosing an appropriate greeting. [To the door-ee, this will appear as hesitation to answer]
[28-Aug-2011 19:23:37]  <Motoko> (yells) Uh, I'll be there in just a moment...!
[28-Aug-2011 19:23:49]  <Cassie> She opens the door, ready to salute if necessary
[28-Aug-2011 19:23:59]  *** Spacebar <~CM-2a@71-38-159-63.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #MadokaMadness
[28-Aug-2011 19:24:03]  * Loki_Weyland opens the door. "Yeah"?
[28-Aug-2011 19:24:04]  <Gendo> Well, when each of you open your doors, you see the tech that escorted Motoko last night.
[28-Aug-2011 19:24:04]  * Motoko rushes hurriedly to get in uniform
[28-Aug-2011 19:24:36]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Good morning," Osip mutters.
[28-Aug-2011 19:24:37]  <Motoko> 14Six clones?! Unexpected twist!
[28-Aug-2011 19:24:42]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [pff]
[28-Aug-2011 19:24:49]  <Gendo> "I was... um... asked to make sure you don't get lost on the way to the cafeteria" she says.
[28-Aug-2011 19:25:11]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [would it be appropriate to assume, after 3 months on base, that I know where it is? :P]
[28-Aug-2011 19:25:12]  <Loki_Weyland> $DO we have maps?
[28-Aug-2011 19:25:25]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: Yes.  
[28-Aug-2011 19:25:47]  * JackMackerel gets her uniform on, reasonably up to NERV standards, but with a few gigs here and there.
[28-Aug-2011 19:26:00]  * Motoko hops to the door on one foot, still pulling on a shoe
[28-Aug-2011 19:26:03]  <Cassie> "Thank you technician..." Cassie trails off as she reads her guide's name tag.
[28-Aug-2011 19:26:10]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: Yes you do, but even with a map, NERV is somewhat difficult to navigate for newbies.
[28-Aug-2011 19:26:16]  <Loki_Weyland> $Right.
[28-Aug-2011 19:26:26]  <Loki_Weyland> "I have a map, you know."
[28-Aug-2011 19:26:30]  <Gendo> Cassie:  She see's you glance.
[28-Aug-2011 19:26:43]  * Loki_Weyland goes over to the dresser, and gets map.
[28-Aug-2011 19:26:49]  <Gendo> "Oh!  Right!  I'm Yumi.  Yumi Tamae!" she says, somewhat flustered.
[28-Aug-2011 19:27:04]  <Lou> "Thank you, I already know where it is.  Am I expected there?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:27:11]  <Loki_Weyland> ...This place is a maze. Where were you taking me again?
[28-Aug-2011 19:27:28]  * JackMackerel tries finding her way to... er, the staging point by herself.
[28-Aug-2011 19:27:36]  <Cassie> "Sorry for staring. I have difficulty reading the kanji"
[28-Aug-2011 19:27:53]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "No need, Technician. I have been here long enough." He gently lets himself out and heads towards the cafeteria, but pauses. "I must ask…has NERV planned something…particular for today?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:28:07]  <Gendo> "Osip, Lou, you two are fine, so long as you're at the Sync test on time."
[28-Aug-2011 19:28:09]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I wasn't sure if it'd be necessary to ask, unless this happens every day]
[28-Aug-2011 19:28:25]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Understood."
[28-Aug-2011 19:28:29]  <Motoko> おはよう、ゆみちゃん
[28-Aug-2011 19:28:29]  <Gendo> (like I said, I'm totally winging this >.>  Hence the chaos >.<)
[28-Aug-2011 19:28:31]  <Lou> [Wait, we're in the same place?]

[28-Aug-2011 19:29:23]  <Cassie> [Some dormitory set up for the night?]
[28-Aug-2011 19:29:31]  * Loki_Weyland follows the technician.
[28-Aug-2011 19:29:36]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: (He was pointing out that you guys have rooms way off in a different wing, I think)
[28-Aug-2011 19:30:20]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [oh. hm. ewll, this can be clearedu p later, the point is everyone gets to the caf, I'm assuming :P]
[28-Aug-2011 19:30:24]  <JackMackerel> (( Should I roll for Jack getting lost? @_@ ))
[28-Aug-2011 19:30:28]  <Gendo> "So... ummm.... The Sync Test is at 10."
[28-Aug-2011 19:30:41]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: For lulz sake, sure.
[28-Aug-2011 19:30:54]  <Lou> [I don't know what's going on with :roll, sorry.]
[28-Aug-2011 19:31:07]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: d100, get lower than your perception.
[28-Aug-2011 19:31:12]  <Loki_Weyland> Thanks. Shall we go?
[28-Aug-2011 19:31:17]  <JackMackerel> 1d100
[28-Aug-2011 19:31:23]  * Lou goes to the cafeteria.
[28-Aug-2011 19:31:23]  <Cassie> "Why the delay between waking and synch testing?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:31:24]  <JackMackerel> (rage)
[28-Aug-2011 19:31:39]  <Gendo> "Umm... Yeah, the cafeteria is this way"
[28-Aug-2011 19:32:00]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [oh, btw. since me and lou have been on base for 3 months, I'm assuming we're familiar with each other, right? It's pretty much the rest of the PCs who have just arrived at nerv japan]

[28-Aug-2011 19:32:37]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: You find your way to the cafeteria without problem.  Maps and signs are a godsend, no?  
[28-Aug-2011 19:33:01]  <Gendo> "Oh, and, um, the sync test begins at 10."
[28-Aug-2011 19:33:16]  <Loki_Weyland> $I take it she's gathered all of us now, and is taking us to the cafeteria?
[28-Aug-2011 19:33:32]  <JackMackerel> "Hmm hmm~" Jack whistles as she enters, looking to see if the cafeteria's already serving~
[28-Aug-2011 19:33:41]  <Gendo> (Yeah, pretty much.  God, I should just say this stuff instead of trying to RP it >.>)
[28-Aug-2011 19:33:53]  <Loki_Weyland> $Heh.
[28-Aug-2011 19:33:54]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: Cafeteria's been open since 6.
[28-Aug-2011 19:34:13]  <Cassie> [what do the NERV uniforms look like again?]
[28-Aug-2011 19:34:18]  <JackMackerel> (( I hate it in real life, you meet at a cafeteria and it's not open yet. @_@)
[28-Aug-2011 19:34:23]  * Lou enters the cafeteria, gets some rice with vegetables.
[28-Aug-2011 19:34:34]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Cassie: check the AE PDF  for careers at "AT technician". they're these ugly beige things :P

[28-Aug-2011 19:34:51]  <Gendo> On the way, Yumi inches a little closer to Motoko.  "Oh, I meant to check in on you in the infirmary last night, but I got called back.  How are you doing?"

[28-Aug-2011 19:35:40]  * JackMackerel immediately gets in line for breakfast. MENU TIME~
[28-Aug-2011 19:36:11]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [would they have those milk cartons in this caf]
[28-Aug-2011 19:36:23]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [like, those ones with cubic bodies and then the spout on top of the cubic shape]
[28-Aug-2011 19:36:34]  * Lou sits down to eat (unpopular meal!), notices Jacqueline...
[28-Aug-2011 19:36:38]  <Cassie> Cassie thanks Yumi and gets in the meal line, suddenly aware that she has no money with her.
[28-Aug-2011 19:36:41]  <Loki_Weyland> $Gendo: We'll get around to describing them when it comes time for the prose thingy.

[28-Aug-2011 19:36:50]  <Gendo> The cafeteria has a nice assortment of breakfast items, both Japanese and Western.  
[28-Aug-2011 19:36:58]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: I'm doing fine, thanks. Never better!
[28-Aug-2011 19:37:19]  <Gendo> (For the record, the Uniforms I picture are something close to Fuyutsuki's attire, but with light grey pants.)
[28-Aug-2011 19:37:43]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] spoons a somewhat small portion of scrambled eggs onto a plate and takes one milk cartons. He then sits down.
[28-Aug-2011 19:37:54]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> takes a seat*
[28-Aug-2011 19:38:03]  * JackMackerel ...gets a ton of plates. Yanks out a massive bowie knife to cut away at a breaded steak.
[28-Aug-2011 19:38:17]  * Motoko grabs a substantial-but-not-ridiculous amount of food and sits with everyone else
[28-Aug-2011 19:38:19]  <Cassie> Cassie sits down with the other pilots and begins to liberally cover her scrambled eggs with ketchup and hot sauce.
[28-Aug-2011 19:38:56]  <Lou> "...excuse me..." Lou looks at the bowie.  "Are you... who are you?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:39:21]  <Gendo> Motoko: Yumi looks relieved.  "That's good".  
[28-Aug-2011 19:39:34]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: And now you get to detail your entry to NERV.  :P
[28-Aug-2011 19:39:41]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] takes note of Jacqueline's  none-too-utilitarian knife, but reserves his concern as Lou begins to speak.
[28-Aug-2011 19:39:54]  * Loki_Weyland glances at the food for a while before taking a slightly overfilled plate to a table with the other pilots.
[28-Aug-2011 19:39:56]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> uncomfortably takes note*
[28-Aug-2011 19:40:09]  <Loki_Weyland> Who's the new chick?
[28-Aug-2011 19:40:10]  <Cassie> Cassie frowns at Jaqueline's knife "That can't be regulation..."
[28-Aug-2011 19:40:19]  <Loki_Weyland> Nice knife, by the way.
[28-Aug-2011 19:41:18]  <Gendo> Yumi see's Jacqueline.  "Oh, good! You, umm, found your way here."
[28-Aug-2011 19:41:28]  <Loki_Weyland> #SEES.
[28-Aug-2011 19:41:43]  <JackMackerel> "I'm Jaqueline~. Transferred in the other day! Had to airdrop, crashed on some emo kid~. Oh, and thank you. It's a collector's item, it was at Boston when it got its ass kicked by Angels~"
[28-Aug-2011 19:41:52]  <Gendo> "Everyone, this is, umm, this is Jacqueline de Maquerel.  She's, umm, a Pilot just like you".
[28-Aug-2011 19:42:09]  * JackMackerel gives a small wave with the knife, ignoring some of the stares.
[28-Aug-2011 19:42:11]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Wait. Crashed onto…."
[28-Aug-2011 19:42:14]  <Loki_Weyland> Airdrop?
[28-Aug-2011 19:42:32]  <Cassie> "Why would they air drop you? That seems silly."
[28-Aug-2011 19:42:40]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: (For the record, there hasn't been an actual Angel attack yet, that you guys know of.)
[28-Aug-2011 19:42:51]  <Gendo> >.>
[28-Aug-2011 19:42:55]  <Loki_Weyland> Yeah. All I got was a plane flight. Not even first class, either.
[28-Aug-2011 19:43:10]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> ["when it got its ass kicked~"*?]
[28-Aug-2011 19:43:10]  <Motoko> Sounds like a bad stage name...
[28-Aug-2011 19:43:21]  <Lou> [When Boston got its ass kicked, presumably.]
[28-Aug-2011 19:43:37]  <JackMackerel> "Oh, nothing like suicide bombing. Had to parachute out, since I was running late. Something about transit problems..." She shrugs. "Eh, I was stuck in a cargo plane, no seats, so you're lucky, Mr..." She looks at Loki.
[28-Aug-2011 19:43:39]  <Lou> "That's... You're a pilot?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:43:50]  <Loki_Weyland> Weyland.
[28-Aug-2011 19:43:58]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki.
[28-Aug-2011 19:44:29]  * JackMackerel smiles and giggles a bit. "Well, since you haven't pulled some foolish prank, are you sure that name fits~?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:44:41]  <Loki_Weyland> How do you know I haven't?
[28-Aug-2011 19:44:42]  <Cassie> "So did NERV fly you over in cargo for secrecy or to save money?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:44:52]  <Loki_Weyland> Both, I'm guessing.
[28-Aug-2011 19:45:02]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [btw wot's my rank in the Russian army? Lieutenant? (I reallyw anna say leytenant lololo)]

[28-Aug-2011 19:46:39]  <Loki_Weyland> $ JackMackerel: We're not necessarily following that.
[28-Aug-2011 19:46:40]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [NO. /ME EATS A FORKFUL OF SCRAMBLED EGGS. THEN, /ME EATS ANOTHER FORKFUL]
[28-Aug-2011 19:46:46]  <JackMackerel> (( I know, I know. @_@)
[28-Aug-2011 19:46:47]  <Cassie> [I think it was just flooded like every coastal area and used as the sample base of operations]
[28-Aug-2011 19:47:35]  <Lou> "I mean... are you a soldier?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:48:28]  <Loki_Weyland> $ JackMackerel!
[28-Aug-2011 19:48:30]  <JackMackerel> "I dunno. Probably both, but I'm nothing special." Jack smiled a smile that's only worn by serial killers on film.
[28-Aug-2011 19:48:36]  <JackMackerel> (( I know,a rgh @_@)
[28-Aug-2011 19:48:41]  <Loki_Weyland> $Ah, you were typing.
[28-Aug-2011 19:49:11]  <Loki_Weyland> $Both?
[28-Aug-2011 19:49:35]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] sums up some will and asks. "Um. About that «kid»…"
[28-Aug-2011 19:49:38]  <Cassie> "Why would you carry around a melee weapon? By the time an aggressor has come within range for it to be useful, the Tokyo 3 police force, Section 2 and designated base security have all failed to do their jobs?"
[28-Aug-2011 19:49:51]  <JackMackerel> (( "for secrecy or to save money?" )
[28-Aug-2011 19:49:55]  * Lou continues eating silently...
[28-Aug-2011 19:49:57]  <Loki_Weyland> $Ah.
[28-Aug-2011 19:50:51]  <Gendo> (brb I need to go grab actual dice while Spacebar is being debugged)
[28-Aug-2011 19:51:02]  <Loki_Weyland> $Use GameServ.
[28-Aug-2011 19:51:09]  <Loki_Weyland> $Also, I have dice if you need them.
[28-Aug-2011 19:51:11]  * JackMackerel gave Cassie an odd stare. "I find it better to be prepared rather getting caught off guard~.:
[28-Aug-2011 19:51:23]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Gendo: but we have…what about gameserv?]
[28-Aug-2011 19:51:36]  <Loki_Weyland> $d4, d8, 2d10, d12, 2d20
[28-Aug-2011 19:51:38]  <Lou> [Apparently it doesn't respond to PMs]
[28-Aug-2011 19:51:38]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [!roll etc., but I Think you mean to roll privately, I guess?]
[28-Aug-2011 19:51:40]  <Motoko> 14Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: He wants to do rolls in private.
[28-Aug-2011 19:51:44]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Thought so.]
[28-Aug-2011 19:52:10]  <Lou> [Gendo: PM GameServ, not EsperBot. /msg gameserv roll d100]
[28-Aug-2011 19:52:17]  <Loki_Weyland> That's something I can agree with. Better safe than sorry.
[28-Aug-2011 19:52:31]  <JackMackerel> (( Wait, do we know about the EVA and what we're going to do? I know it sounds obvious, but largh.)
[28-Aug-2011 19:53:05]  <Gendo> (Well, too late now.  Got my own dice.)
[28-Aug-2011 19:53:34]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [JackMackerel: In our briefing they showedu s the evas and that we'll pilot them against "the angels", which we haven't seen before.]
[28-Aug-2011 19:53:43]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [but we know they're like, godzilla-esque monsers.]
[28-Aug-2011 19:53:45]  <JackMackerel> (( Okay, thanks. ))
[28-Aug-2011 19:54:07]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [np]
[28-Aug-2011 19:54:16]  <Loki_Weyland> $I have a special die that I'd like to use for really important rolls, if it's OK. The thing belonged to my half-brother, who used it for D&D.
[28-Aug-2011 19:54:19]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: The scientists have given a brief explanation about Angels being a threat to mankind, and the Evas being used fight them.  They refused to explain how they know Angels exist, but said that they provided the UN with enough evidence to gather funding
[28-Aug-2011 19:54:36]  <Lou> ["this sounds legit"]
[28-Aug-2011 19:54:55]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: I'll trust you not to fudge :P
[28-Aug-2011 19:55:01]  <Loki_Weyland> $I won'.
[28-Aug-2011 19:55:04]  <Loki_Weyland> *won't.
[28-Aug-2011 19:55:05]  <JackMackerel> (( Kk. ))
[28-Aug-2011 19:55:45]  <Gendo> Alright, we all done with breakfast?
[28-Aug-2011 19:55:52]  * JackMackerel shrugs. "Besides, I find it good to practice even when out of those freaky mechs~."
[28-Aug-2011 19:56:01]  <Gendo> (I guess not)
[28-Aug-2011 19:56:05]  * JackMackerel keeps stabbing the shit out of her chicken... steak. What are they called again?
[28-Aug-2011 19:56:08]  <Lou> "..."
[28-Aug-2011 19:56:29]  <Loki_Weyland> EVAs. You haven't read up?
[28-Aug-2011 19:56:44]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I'd say so… also @JackMackerel didja mean for jaqueline to miss/ignore my question? (just making sure)]
[28-Aug-2011 19:57:16]  <JackMackerel> (( No, sorry. Juggling a bunch of different channels. >.>)
[28-Aug-2011 19:57:43]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [np. Want me to copypaste?]
[28-Aug-2011 19:57:44]  <JackMackerel> (( Was it "Crashed into...?" ))
[28-Aug-2011 19:57:48]  <JackMackerel> (( Yeah. ))
[28-Aug-2011 19:57:56]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] sums up some will and asks. "Um. About that «kid»…"]
[28-Aug-2011 19:58:18]  <Loki_Weyland> I was wondering about that too, actually.
[28-Aug-2011 19:58:58]  * JackMackerel asks, "What kid?" She tilts her head. Instead of being moe, it comes off as creepy.
[28-Aug-2011 19:59:18]  <Loki_Weyland> The one you crashed into?
[28-Aug-2011 19:59:24]  <Gendo> (I'm loling at all this so hard right now)
[28-Aug-2011 20:00:12]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [am I kawaii, uguuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu]
[28-Aug-2011 20:00:23]  <JackMackerel> Oh, uhm. He looked like he was in need of a good cry~. Pretty sure he wasn't NERV... well, kinda. I bet he was a possible candidate or something~
[28-Aug-2011 20:00:38]  * Motoko continues eating voraciously in the background
[28-Aug-2011 20:00:50]  <Lou> "How are you doing that with your voice?  At the ends of sentences?"
[28-Aug-2011 20:00:57]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [lol]
[28-Aug-2011 20:00:57]  * Loki_Weyland cocks an eyebrow.
[28-Aug-2011 20:01:13]  * JackMackerel giggles. "It was some school, too, so a bunch of kids were staring. Oh, this~? It's just some silly anime thing, don't worry~"
[28-Aug-2011 20:01:15]  <Loki_Weyland> $Lou: I'm pretty sure that just means she drags out the last syllable.
[28-Aug-2011 20:01:17]  <JackMackerel> (( LOOOOL ))
[28-Aug-2011 20:01:28]  <JackMackerel> (( Or does it in sing-song. ))
[28-Aug-2011 20:01:34]  <Lou> "What's anime?"
[28-Aug-2011 20:01:42]  <Lou> *'anime'
[28-Aug-2011 20:01:43]  <Cassie> "Anime?"
[28-Aug-2011 20:02:04]  <JackMackerel> Japanese cartoons, thilly gooth~.
[28-Aug-2011 20:02:12]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] frowns at the elaboration. "«In need of a good cry»…very charitable of you."
[28-Aug-2011 20:02:35]  <Gendo> (I am so tempted to add said emo kid to the cast eventually >.>)
[28-Aug-2011 20:02:44]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [that's all for me, in terms of questions.]
[28-Aug-2011 20:02:47]  <Cassie> Cassie's face brightens "Oh like Spider-man and Scooby Doo?"
[28-Aug-2011 20:03:00]  <JackMackerel> Thank you~! Yes, like that.
[28-Aug-2011 20:03:08]  * Loki_Weyland opens mouth to rant on anime, but decides against it.
[28-Aug-2011 20:03:56]  <Cassie> "So is the character who does the... thing~ at the end of their sentences a talking dog?" 
[28-Aug-2011 20:04:20]  <Gendo> (anyways, we have 2 hours of allotted time left, I'd like to get the Sync Test done, and possibly something else, so I think I'm going to force the game onwards, sorry...)
[28-Aug-2011 20:04:33]  <JackMackerel> Er... anime isn't a series~. <Blah blah long nerd rant blah>
[28-Aug-2011 20:04:35]  <JackMackerel> (Okay.)
[28-Aug-2011 20:05:05]  <Lou> "...we should get to the sync test." Lou doesn't want gaps in his knowledge to be any more obvious.
[28-Aug-2011 20:05:06]  <Loki_Weyland> $We'll say that conversation drifts in the subject of anime, with Jack and Loki providing most of the explanation.
[28-Aug-2011 20:05:16]  <Gendo> At about 9:30, Yumi returns to your table.  "I, umm.. Is everyone finished?  We need to get going now."
[28-Aug-2011 20:05:30]  * JackMackerel grins. "We're ready~"
[28-Aug-2011 20:05:39]  <Loki_Weyland> Hm? Oh, sure.
[28-Aug-2011 20:05:49]  <Cassie> "Understood"
[28-Aug-2011 20:06:05]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Yes, ready."
[28-Aug-2011 20:06:27]  * Motoko gets up fromt he table
[28-Aug-2011 20:06:45]  <Gendo> "Alright.  Well, I'll show you to the changing rooms.  Osip, you can make your way to the Observatory".
[28-Aug-2011 20:07:03]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] nods and does so.
[28-Aug-2011 20:07:22]  <Gendo> (blah blah blah, skipping walking >.>)
[28-Aug-2011 20:07:37]  * Loki_Weyland gets up, grabs a small muffin from the cafeteria, and follows.
[28-Aug-2011 20:07:39]  <Gendo> You arrive at the end of a hall, with a door on either side.
[28-Aug-2011 20:07:55]  <Gendo> There are no words, but the sick figures on the doors make it clear who goes to which changing room.
[28-Aug-2011 20:07:57]  <Gendo> *stick
[28-Aug-2011 20:08:08]  <Loki_Weyland> $Fun typo.
[28-Aug-2011 20:08:12]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [totally sick figures bro]
[28-Aug-2011 20:08:17]  <Gendo> (shuddup)
[28-Aug-2011 20:08:17]  <JackMackerel> (( Lol. ))
[28-Aug-2011 20:08:38]  <Gendo> ("why would someone even draw that!  Is that his...  why?")
[28-Aug-2011 20:08:56]  * Lou changes into his plugsuit.  "Once again..."
[28-Aug-2011 20:09:24]  <Gendo> "Your, umm, your plugsuits have already been provided inside."
[28-Aug-2011 20:09:59]  <Loki_Weyland> I've been curious about these things for a while now.
[28-Aug-2011 20:09:59]  * JackMackerel keeps staring at the others as they change.
[28-Aug-2011 20:10:07]  <Lou> [We're in separate rooms]
[28-Aug-2011 20:10:18]  <Lou> [wait no nvm]
[28-Aug-2011 20:10:21]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: You're in the female changing room.  So you can only observe Motoko and Cassie :P
[28-Aug-2011 20:10:36]  * Motoko makes sure to stay as far away from Jackie as humanly possible
[28-Aug-2011 20:10:37]  <Cassie> Cassie nervously tries to hide behind a locker door and change.
[28-Aug-2011 20:10:44]  <JackMackerel> (( I know. )))
[28-Aug-2011 20:11:07]  * Motoko gives Cassie a significant look, nods at Jackie
[28-Aug-2011 20:11:26]  <Lou> "They're designed to allow the most ease of movement possible while still letting LCL flow, Loki."
[28-Aug-2011 20:11:43]  <Gendo> (I'm tempted to detail a "Why would you do that" style disinfection/sterilization sequence before the sync test starts >.>)
[28-Aug-2011 20:11:53]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [like, on the outsdie of the suits?]
[28-Aug-2011 20:12:32]  <Loki_Weyland> I know that, Lou. Hell, there's probably a few things I know that you don't. I've done my homework.
[28-Aug-2011 20:12:45]  <Loki_Weyland> ...Are there microphones in here?
[28-Aug-2011 20:12:53]  <Loki_Weyland> Cameras?
[28-Aug-2011 20:12:53]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [spy!]
[28-Aug-2011 20:12:54]  <Lou> "There are microphones everwhere."
[28-Aug-2011 20:12:58]  <Lou> *everywhere
[28-Aug-2011 20:13:01]  <Lou> "And cameras, yes."
[28-Aug-2011 20:13:03]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: None that you can see, but Lou is probably right :P
[28-Aug-2011 20:13:20]  <Loki_Weyland> Hm.
[28-Aug-2011 20:13:40]  <Lou> "If you've done your homework, you must know that they can make them very, very small..."
[28-Aug-2011 20:13:45]  * Loki_Weyland makes a mental note to come back with a noise generator.
[28-Aug-2011 20:13:58]  <Cassie> [Are the plugsuits the same color scheme of our Evas?]
[28-Aug-2011 20:14:12]  * JackMackerel grins... suddenly. It's a "get in my van" grin.
[28-Aug-2011 20:14:24]  * Lou tries to read Loki's expression.  "Are you disappointed that plugsuits are unarmored?"
[28-Aug-2011 20:14:27]  <Gendo> (Also, as a warning, for the sync test, I'm going to detail Osip's side of things in the channel, and then detail your individual experience in PMs.  Probably.  So things will move slowly then.  Probably.)
[28-Aug-2011 20:14:37]  <Loki_Weyland> A bit, yeah.
[28-Aug-2011 20:14:39]  <JackMackerel> Kkk.
[28-Aug-2011 20:14:42]  <JackMackerel> (Er, kk)
[28-Aug-2011 20:15:05]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [/me is suddenly afraid of lagging everyone else behind. I WILL DO MY BEST]
[28-Aug-2011 20:15:11]  <Gendo> Cassie: The color schemes are similar, but not necessarily the same.  Everything on the plugsuit seems more subdued.
[28-Aug-2011 20:15:34]  <Lou> "No amount of armor could protect us outside."
[28-Aug-2011 20:15:35]  <Lou> /me finishes changing and walks on.
[28-Aug-2011 20:15:45]  <Loki_Weyland> I'm done.
[28-Aug-2011 20:15:46]  <Cassie> Cassie briefly considers throwing her toothbrush at Jaqueline, but dismisses that as unprofessional.
[28-Aug-2011 20:16:12]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: Don't worry.  This is pretty much a "I detail the lowest roll in channel, and describe everything else in PMs", but since you have the lowest sync score, yeah.
[28-Aug-2011 20:16:29]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [AUTOMATIC LOWEST ROLL]
[28-Aug-2011 20:16:30]  <Gendo> It'd happen similarly anyhow.
[28-Aug-2011 20:16:34]  * JackMackerel sniggers oddly. "Perverts~"
[28-Aug-2011 20:16:54]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Well, wait. Haven't I already been familiarized with the trident, or is that ret-conned?]
[28-Aug-2011 20:17:15]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: You have had a fair amount of training.  Mostly in simulators, but once or twice in the actual thing.
[28-Aug-2011 20:17:50]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Ah, okay. …. the roll thing is just an explanation of why I'll be talked about, then]
[28-Aug-2011 20:18:57]  <Cassie> Cassie's face reddens and she glares. She opens her mouth to speak and looks ready to snap back a nasty retort but simple asks "Are we all ready to go to the synch tests now?"
[28-Aug-2011 20:19:07]  <Gendo> Alright.  When you guys are finished changing, there is a doorway at the rear of the changing rooms, with a sign that says "Cage".
[28-Aug-2011 20:19:29]  * Loki_Weyland goes in.
[28-Aug-2011 20:19:31]  * JackMackerel waves at nothing in particular, her bowie in her hands again. "Is there  a way to cut the camera acess off?"
[28-Aug-2011 20:19:31]  * Lou keeps going unhesitatingly
[28-Aug-2011 20:19:33]  <JackMackerel> *access
[28-Aug-2011 20:19:40]  <Gendo> {hold on a sec...}
[28-Aug-2011 20:20:04]  <Motoko> "Cage"? I don't like the sound of this...
[28-Aug-2011 20:20:22]  <Loki_Weyland> They probably chose that because it sounded cool.
[28-Aug-2011 20:20:27]  <Lou> [Are the males and females in the same room yet?]
[28-Aug-2011 20:20:33]  <Gendo> Lou: Yes.
[28-Aug-2011 20:20:35]  <Cassie> "NERV does have a tendency for odd naming conventions..."
[28-Aug-2011 20:20:42]  <Lou> "Unfortunately not."
[28-Aug-2011 20:20:52]  <Loki_Weyland> It's memorable, at least.
[28-Aug-2011 20:20:57]  * Lou turns to Jacqueline.  "Where are you going to keep that?"
[28-Aug-2011 20:21:06]  <Gendo> As you all exit the changing rooms, you enter a somewhat small chamber, and the doors shut behind you.
[28-Aug-2011 20:21:12]  <Gendo> You hear a mechanical voice...
[28-Aug-2011 20:21:24]  <Gendo> "Sterilization Sequence Commencing"
[28-Aug-2011 20:21:28]  <JackMackerel> (( Eh, say she left it in the changing room. >.> ))
[28-Aug-2011 20:21:35]  * Lou braces
[28-Aug-2011 20:21:53]  * JackMackerel frowns. "Oh, no..."
[28-Aug-2011 20:22:17]  <Gendo> Almost as soon as the voice stops, a burning rain of chemicals?  Water? something, pours down on you.
[28-Aug-2011 20:22:19]  <Loki_Weyland> What's the big deal?
[28-Aug-2011 20:22:24]  <Loki_Weyland> Gah!
[28-Aug-2011 20:22:28]  <Gendo> It smells vaguely of sulfur.
[28-Aug-2011 20:22:46]  <Gendo> After about 15 seconds of the torrent, it stops.
[28-Aug-2011 20:23:05]  <Motoko> 14>unpleasant gas chamber imagery
[28-Aug-2011 20:23:09]  <Gendo> Suddenly, and icy spray of water rinses you off.
[28-Aug-2011 20:23:18]  <Gendo> Motoko: (that's part of the idea >.>)
[28-Aug-2011 20:23:39]  <Cassie> Cassie shrieks from the cold
[28-Aug-2011 20:23:43]  * JackMackerel shivers, frowning. "Ggh..."
[28-Aug-2011 20:23:43]  <Lou> "I'm sorry.  I should have warned you."
[28-Aug-2011 20:23:56]  <Loki_Weyland> Yes. Please do next time.
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:01]  <Gendo> This contrast between hot chemicals, and icy rinse continues for about 5 cycles.
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:09]  <Lou> "Well, next time you'll know..."
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:12]  <Gendo> Each chemical wash adds another unpleasant scent to the room.  
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:18]  <Loki_Weyland> Thanks for nothing!
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:24]  <Gendo> But the end of the sequence, it feels as though your noses are going to fall off.
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:27]  <Motoko> I feel like I'm in a washing machine... only thing missing is the spinning...
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:32]  * Loki_Weyland starts swearing.
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:38]  <Cassie> "This toothbrush is probably ruined, isn't it?"
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:42]  <Gendo> Motoko: (Dont' tempt me).
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:45]  <Loki_Weyland> Don't worry, I'm sure that'll come next!
[28-Aug-2011 20:24:50]  <Lou> "Well, this does remind me.  You're going to be submerged in liquid, but you can breathe it, so don't worry."
[28-Aug-2011 20:25:01]  <JackMackerel> (( Wait, actually, say I still have the bowie. >.> ))
[28-Aug-2011 20:25:20]  <Loki_Weyland> I've heard a bit about that stuff, yeah.
[28-Aug-2011 20:25:25]  <Loki_Weyland> Not too sure about this bit.

[28-Aug-2011 20:36:03]  <Gendo> The entry plugs are all extruding from the necks of the Evas.  A ladder on the side leads to an open hatch towards the top of the plug.
[28-Aug-2011 20:36:10]  * Motoko does not hear Loki_Weyland, being several hundred metres away!
[28-Aug-2011 20:36:23]  <Loki_Weyland> $Right.
[28-Aug-2011 20:37:27]  <Gendo> (I'm trying to find dimensions of the plug, to no avail.  Asume about as wide as a car, and as long as a school bus, I guess.

[28-Aug-2011 20:39:32]  <JackMackerel> (( Yeah, I think they do. ))
[28-Aug-2011 20:39:32]  <Gendo> (As soon as each of you take your seat in the plug, the entry hatch snaps shut, and a viscous, amber liquid begins to fill the plug.)

[28-Aug-2011 20:41:22]  <JackMackerel> It smells like... sexual assault...
[28-Aug-2011 20:41:26]  <Loki_Weyland> Eugh. I want to spit this stuff out, but I can't!
[28-Aug-2011 20:41:29]  <Cassie> "Sigh. Well at least it's not cold"
[28-Aug-2011 20:41:48]  <Loki_Weyland> I'd prefer cold. Right now it feels like I'm swimming in piss.
[28-Aug-2011 20:41:48]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [conventional mech cockpits, like a boss (I think)]
[28-Aug-2011 20:41:49]  <Motoko> Lou, this doesn't look particularly breathable, and it's up to my arms!
[28-Aug-2011 20:42:06]  <Lou> "Just don't panic.  I'm already submerged."
[28-Aug-2011 20:42:22]  <Cassie> "Thank you for that image Loki. I prefer to think it's more like a bug being stuck in amber."
[28-Aug-2011 20:42:46]  <Motoko> "Don't panic" sounds nice on the cover of a book, not when I'm possibly drowning!
[28-Aug-2011 20:42:46]  <JackMackerel> "Are there any methods we have to learn for this, or are we fine just breathing it?"
[28-Aug-2011 20:42:51]  * Loki_Weyland hums the theme to Jurassic Park.

[28-Aug-2011 20:46:46]  <Gendo> (Alright, got that all done.)

[28-Aug-2011 21:00:56]  <Loki_Weyland> Hm. Odd.
[28-Aug-2011 21:01:03]  <Motoko> Is anybody else getting weird... interference on their headset?
[28-Aug-2011 21:01:04]  <JackMackerel> "I think it's my side. I'm hearing something... gibberish."
[28-Aug-2011 21:01:04]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [oh yes, this eva feature. ~]
[28-Aug-2011 21:01:13]  <JackMackerel> I'm getting the same thing, Motoko...
[28-Aug-2011 21:01:15]  <Loki_Weyland> Hm.
[28-Aug-2011 21:01:20]  * JackMackerel sounds... serious. It's not a good sound...
[28-Aug-2011 21:01:25]  <Lou> [lol everybody got the same]
[28-Aug-2011 21:01:32]  <Loki_Weyland> I'm hearing a bit of something like that, yeah.
[28-Aug-2011 21:01:40]  <Loki_Weyland> Shouldn't be that important, though.
[28-Aug-2011 21:01:42]  <Lou> "Doctor.  Can we start?"
[28-Aug-2011 21:02:13]  <Gendo> The bars representing synch ratios on the large monitor in the Observatory slowly even out, with everyone at a relatively high level.
[28-Aug-2011 21:02:29]  <Gendo> "We've already started, Lou.  Easy, right?"
[28-Aug-2011 21:02:42]  * JackMackerel grunts, still annoyed. "Let me guess, some psychic bullcrap interfering with the synchronization."
[28-Aug-2011 21:02:50]  <Motoko> Sounds like a talk radio station coming in...
[28-Aug-2011 21:02:50]  <Loki_Weyland> Spooky.
[28-Aug-2011 21:02:52]  <Gendo> (now I need to go do more secretive GM stuffs.  Can everyone pm me their final synch scores?"
[28-Aug-2011 21:02:57]  <Lou> "y-yes."
[28-Aug-2011 21:03:01]  <Loki_Weyland> Motoko: Makes about as much sense.
[28-Aug-2011 21:03:13]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Gendo 2d100, right?
[28-Aug-2011 21:03:23]  <Cassie> 2d10
[28-Aug-2011 21:03:29]  <Lou> [Your base SR plus 2d10 if you passed the Willpower test.]
[28-Aug-2011 21:04:29]  <Motoko> 14If you passed the first Willpower test, roll 2d10 and add that to SR. If you passed the second one, no rolls. Failed both, 2d10 and subtract from SR.
[28-Aug-2011 21:04:57]  <Lou> "Yes.  It is.  How is everybody else?"
[28-Aug-2011 21:05:24]  * JackMackerel snorts. "What, Art Bell? It IS gibberish, so it's not any different. I hear you loud and clear, but I still have interference, over."
[28-Aug-2011 21:05:24]  <Loki_Weyland> Gibberish seems to have died down.
[28-Aug-2011 21:05:35]  <Cassie> "Audio interference has diminished significantly"
[28-Aug-2011 21:06:07]  <JackMackerel> I'm still getting some traces of it.

[28-Aug-2011 21:06:43]  <Loki_Weyland> Has anyone noticed this before?
[28-Aug-2011 21:06:51]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: You didn't PM me your sync ratio....

[28-Aug-2011 21:07:32]  <Loki_Weyland> Ping.
[28-Aug-2011 21:07:55]  <Lou> "Still here."

[28-Aug-2011 21:08:39]  <Gendo> "You say you're hearing noise?  That's odd.  The frequency is reserved in the Geofront, and we're far enough underground that nothing on the surface can interfere....  I'll have someone look at it."
[28-Aug-2011 21:09:07]  * JackMackerel mutters. "I wonder if we have telepaths or something equally sillyyy..."
[28-Aug-2011 21:09:21]  <Cassie> "Are-are you alright pilot Jaqueline?"
[28-Aug-2011 21:09:39]  <Gendo> "In the mean time, the test is finished.  Everyone's results are more than satisfactory, so I think you can clamber out now."

[28-Aug-2011 21:11:35]  * Lou climbs out.
[28-Aug-2011 21:11:40]  <Loki_Weyland> $Especially Barcode. You'd like it.
[28-Aug-2011 21:11:57]  * Motoko clambers out of the entry plug

[28-Aug-2011 21:12:17]  <Loki_Weyland> Well, that was probably one of the oddest experiences I've had.
[28-Aug-2011 21:12:18]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Loki_Weyland - I saw it. I kind of liked it. The dogfight scenes were incredible, though the story was a little simplistic.]
[28-Aug-2011 21:12:20]  <Gendo> "Not training today."
[28-Aug-2011 21:12:43]  <Loki_Weyland> $Yeah, it's hard to have an epic story in four episodes or a movie.
[28-Aug-2011 21:12:45]  <Cassie> Cassie gets out and brushes her hair out of her face
[28-Aug-2011 21:12:58]  <Loki_Weyland> $Watch SDF Macross if you liked Plus.

[28-Aug-2011 21:13:08]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Another~? :P]
[28-Aug-2011 21:13:12]  * Lou stands and stares at a wall.
[28-Aug-2011 21:13:19]  <Loki_Weyland> Crap, we're going to have to detox again, aren't we?
[28-Aug-2011 21:13:48]  <Lou> [none of us can hear you, how sad]
[28-Aug-2011 21:14:01]  <Gendo> "No, Loki, you don't need to go through the sterilization process again today.  You might enjoy a shower, though.  LCL is a hassle to wash off after it dries."
[28-Aug-2011 21:14:13]  <Loki_Weyland> Thanks for the info.
[28-Aug-2011 21:14:27]  <Lou> [Loki, what's Macross+ even about?  I've seen Robotech but uh]
[28-Aug-2011 21:14:30]  <Gendo> (blah blah blah, back to the changing room, showers, etc.)
[28-Aug-2011 21:14:31]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Gendo: I'm going to need everyone's PM info for the prose later, so be sure to save it.
[28-Aug-2011 21:14:46]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Lou: Robotech is pretty close to SDF Macross.
[28-Aug-2011 21:14:50]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: I will.  
[28-Aug-2011 21:14:55]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Good.
[28-Aug-2011 21:14:59]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Oh, uh. Should I have a scene here?]
[28-Aug-2011 21:15:26]  <Cassie> [$Yeah, it's hard to have an epic story in four episodes or a movie. <-- Seven was enough for Giant Robo though]
[28-Aug-2011 21:15:33]  <Loki_Weyland> $ I need to finish that.
[28-Aug-2011 21:15:44]  <Loki_Weyland> $ I'll watch it later today, I guess.
[28-Aug-2011 21:15:56]  <Gendo> (Back in the observatory, after the pilots leave for the changing rooms....)
[28-Aug-2011 21:16:01]  <Cassie> [so are we back at the changing rooms now or something?]
[28-Aug-2011 21:16:20]  <JackMackerel> That was disappointing...
[28-Aug-2011 21:16:24]  * JackMackerel smiles somewhat.
[28-Aug-2011 21:16:29]  <Lou> "Disappointing?"
[28-Aug-2011 21:17:23]  <Cassie> "I'm just content the wash didn't rinse out my hair dye. Still I would have liked to actually move Unit 14"
[28-Aug-2011 21:17:29]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: A medium sized man of strong build enters through the door.  You've seen him before and recognize him as Vice-Commander Nagai Naoyuki.
[28-Aug-2011 21:17:40]  <JackMackerel> I expected a combat simulation.
[28-Aug-2011 21:17:42]  <Loki_Weyland> $ For the sake of story and gameplay, let's say the changing room is essentially one room, with a barrier between the male and female halves. There's a gap near the ceiling, so you can hear each other rather well.
[28-Aug-2011 21:17:52]  <JackMackerel> See what we're up against... even if it's just a sim.
[28-Aug-2011 21:18:15]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] notices, and salutes. "Sir."
[28-Aug-2011 21:18:29]  <Loki_Weyland> Yeah, I'd like to do a sim too.
[28-Aug-2011 21:18:38]  * JackMackerel spins her bowie.
[28-Aug-2011 21:18:42]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: The Vice-commander returns your salute, then approaches Dr. Murai, and hands him a disk, whispering something in his ear.
[28-Aug-2011 21:18:45]  <Gendo> He then turns and leaves.
[28-Aug-2011 21:18:50]  <Loki_Weyland> It's a cliche, but you've got to walk before you can run.
[28-Aug-2011 21:19:04]  * JackMackerel spins it deftly, expertly, flipping it from hand to hand as if it was a butterfly knife and not a huge-ass knife.
[28-Aug-2011 21:19:28]  <Cassie> "Jaqueline, is that really necessary?"
[28-Aug-2011 21:19:42]  <JackMackerel> No~
[28-Aug-2011 21:19:56]  <Loki_Weyland> Remind me to buy a butterfly knife.
[28-Aug-2011 21:20:06]  <Gendo> Pilots:  Dr. Murai's voice is broadcast over the intercoms.  "Something has just come up.  Please come to the observatory as soon as you're cleaned up."
[28-Aug-2011 21:20:27]  <Loki_Weyland> $ I know a guy who can flip knives. It's always a bit disconcerting every time he does it.
[28-Aug-2011 21:20:31]  <Loki_Weyland> Yeah, sure.
[28-Aug-2011 21:20:58]  <JackMackerel> I have an extra if you want. Mastercrafted. Pre-deluge, too, and it's pristine.
[28-Aug-2011 21:21:03]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> (@gendo) As the Commander leaves, Osip turns to Dr. Murai. "…If I may ask, Doctor… does this pertain to our training?"
[28-Aug-2011 21:21:06]  <Loki_Weyland> Sweet.
[28-Aug-2011 21:21:13]  * Motoko washes remaining LCL out of hair and redresses, glad Jacqueline is distracted by knives
[28-Aug-2011 21:21:20]  * JackMackerel smiles creepily. "Are you sure you can handle it~?"
[28-Aug-2011 21:21:37]  <Loki_Weyland> No, I was thinking of buying a practice knife first.
[28-Aug-2011 21:21:48]  <JackMackerel> I can teach you~
[28-Aug-2011 21:21:56]  <Loki_Weyland> Thanks.
[28-Aug-2011 21:21:56]  <Gendo> "Yes it does, Osip.  I'll fill you in with the rest of the pilots."
[28-Aug-2011 21:22:06]  * Lou looks over at them suspiciously, then walks off to the observatory
[28-Aug-2011 21:22:06]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Understood."
[28-Aug-2011 21:22:15]  <Gendo> (skipping to the Observatory is acceptable, yes?)
[28-Aug-2011 21:22:26]  * JackMackerel gets redressed and does that odd Russian-Roulette thing with her fingers while waiting for the others to dress.
[28-Aug-2011 21:22:40]  <Loki_Weyland> $Russian Roulette?
[28-Aug-2011 21:22:51]  <Lou> [stab between your fingers?]

[28-Aug-2011 21:23:02]  <Loki_Weyland> $Ah.
[28-Aug-2011 21:23:03]  <Cassie> Cassie gets dressed but keeps her hair clips on.
[28-Aug-2011 21:23:09]  <Loki_Weyland> $Like they did in Aliens.
[28-Aug-2011 21:23:12]  <Loki_Weyland> $That was a fun scene.

[28-Aug-2011 21:31:30]  <Gendo> This video was taken a couple of hours ago.  The digital timestamp lines up with when the MAGI reported a Blue pattern.
[28-Aug-2011 21:31:39]  <Gendo> (that should be in quotes >.>)

[28-Aug-2011 21:33:39]  <JackMackerel> They don't look like angels to me... Biblical OR otherwise...
[28-Aug-2011 21:34:15]  <Gendo> This video was taken outside of the Tokyo-3 mall.
[28-Aug-2011 21:34:16]  <Loki_Weyland> Standard NERV naming protocol is to pick whatever sounds the coolest or most mysterious.

[28-Aug-2011 21:35:09]  <Loki_Weyland> Anyway, do we have any witnesses?
[28-Aug-2011 21:35:57]  <Gendo> "We've been receiving reports of similar sightings for the past couple days.  We didn't think much of it, as this doesn't match the predicted scale of an Angel."
[28-Aug-2011 21:36:34]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "But Doctor, surely any Angel presence is worth concern, isn't it?"
[28-Aug-2011 21:37:36]  <Gendo> "We receive a variety of reports.  Something like "I saw something appear then disappear" don't really catch interest until some sort of proof shows up."
[28-Aug-2011 21:38:25]  <Gendo> "There isn't much we can gain from this video, other than the Angel appears to be looking for something, and that this threat is real."
