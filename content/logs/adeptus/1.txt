[14-Aug-2011 20:12:05]  <Gendo> Alright.  Game is pseudo starting now.
[14-Aug-2011 20:12:12]  <Loki_Weyland> Right!
[14-Aug-2011 20:12:14]  <Motoko> I am pseudo-ready.
[14-Aug-2011 20:12:27]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Leady.
[14-Aug-2011 20:12:36]  <Loki_Weyland> STANDBY READY
[14-Aug-2011 20:12:48]  <Cassie> My body is ready.
[14-Aug-2011 20:12:49]  <Loki_Weyland> GET YA GUNS ON
[14-Aug-2011 20:13:07]  <Lou> Present.
[14-Aug-2011 20:13:26]  <Loki_Weyland> Great. We're all ready now.
[14-Aug-2011 20:13:26]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland, Cassie:  You two have just arrived at the Tokyo-3 International Airport.  You do not know each other, nor were you on the same flights.  You both, however, are waiting for escorts that have yet to show.
[14-Aug-2011 20:13:52]  <Loki_Weyland> OK.
[14-Aug-2011 20:14:06]  <Motoko> 1,1Narita-3 or Haneda-3? :p
[14-Aug-2011 20:14:19]  <Loki_Weyland> OOC: Is that something I should read?
[14-Aug-2011 20:15:10]  <Lou> [It's a joke, is all.]
[14-Aug-2011 20:15:16]  <Loki_Weyland> Ah.
[14-Aug-2011 20:15:24]  <Loki_Weyland> One I don't think I get.
[14-Aug-2011 20:15:55]  <Lou> [Me neither.  Now get to awkward chit-chat with strangers!]
[14-Aug-2011 20:16:01]  <Gendo> Motoko: After you returned home from school at whatever city you attend, you were greeted by the sight of a tall man, possibly American, at your door.
[14-Aug-2011 20:16:18]  <Cassie> OOC: Are we both wearing clothes that identify us as NERV staff?
[14-Aug-2011 20:16:27]  <Gendo> (getting everyone together at the moment..... :/)
[14-Aug-2011 20:16:36]  <Gendo> Cassie: Casual clothing, no identification.
[14-Aug-2011 20:16:57]  <Motoko> Hello, dark, tall, possibly handsome man!
[14-Aug-2011 20:17:20]  *** Rei <~chatzilla@S0106002191d86b2c.no.shawcable.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 186 seconds)
[14-Aug-2011 20:17:58]  <Loki_Weyland> Cassie: OOC: You forgot to fill out what your character looks like. It can wait, though.
[14-Aug-2011 20:19:31]  <Gendo> Motoko: (retroactively changing time now :D)  The man is not at your door. What were you thinking?  Instead, you walk through the door, and are greeted by the sight of a tall man, blah blah blah, sitting with your mother.  
[14-Aug-2011 20:20:06]  <Gendo> You notice that your mother has a slightly worried look on her face, and the man is carrying a large envelope labeled "TOP SECRET".
[14-Aug-2011 20:20:17]  <Motoko> 1,1Gendo: Reading Steiner kicked in there, didn't it?
[14-Aug-2011 20:20:17]  *** Rei <~chatzilla@S0106001e58eeaf74.no.shawcable.net> has joined #MadokaMadness
[14-Aug-2011 20:20:57]  <Gendo> "Iwatani Motoko", he states, as he thrusts the envelope towards you.  He pronunciation is crude.  Obviously not a native speaker.
[14-Aug-2011 20:21:23]  <Motoko> Yes...?
[14-Aug-2011 20:21:47]  * Motoko opens envelope
[14-Aug-2011 20:22:25]  <Gendo> There are two things in the envelope.  What appears to be a letter, and a small handbook.
[14-Aug-2011 20:22:48]  <Motoko> What... uh, what's this... um... ahh, these are complicated words... "NERV"?
[14-Aug-2011 20:23:02]  <Gendo> The letter is addressed to both you and your mother.  The envelope already having been opened indicates that she has already read it.
[14-Aug-2011 20:24:09]  <Motoko> Ugh, maybe the handbook is easier to read... "Initiation Protocol"... no... Mama, what's this about?
[14-Aug-2011 20:24:31]  <Gendo> In short, the letter says that you'r performance in various areas has been recorded as part of a report done by the Marduk Society, a U.N. sanctioned council, given rights to acquisition personnel accordingly.
[14-Aug-2011 20:24:56]  <Gendo> You are to be relocated to the NERV Headquarters in Tokyo-3, immediately.
[14-Aug-2011 20:25:47]  <Gendo> Your mother says, tearing up,  that she's already gotten the suitcases out.  The suited man affirms that you have an hour to get your things together.
[14-Aug-2011 20:25:51]  <Motoko> Relocated? That doesn't mean... wha, you're not kidnapping me, are you?!
[14-Aug-2011 20:26:32]  <Motoko> ...
[14-Aug-2011 20:26:59]  <Motoko> This is a bad time for jokes... isn't it...
[14-Aug-2011 20:27:04]  <Gendo> "You are not being kidnapped, as you may return periodically.  In return for your services, you will be provided a salary, and compensation will be given to your family".
[14-Aug-2011 20:27:36]  <Gendo> "Failure to comply, however, will be treated as an act of treason.".
[14-Aug-2011 20:28:09]  <Gendo> (this takes a while to type, as none of this is pre-written, sorry)
[14-Aug-2011 20:28:35]  <Motoko> But why? Do I at least get to know what this... Mermaid Society or whatever wants *me* for?
[14-Aug-2011 20:28:37]  <Cassie> After finding a place away from the crowds, Cassie reaches into her pocket, and pulls out one of those disposable toothbrushes you buy at the airport and starts brushing her teeth, occasionally checking her teeth with a compact mirror.
[14-Aug-2011 20:29:10]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki taps his foot impatiently.

[14-Aug-2011 20:30:14]  <Gendo> Motoko: "That will be explained when you arrive.  For now though, know that you will be doing a great service to your country."  The man seems to beam as the last few words linger.
[14-Aug-2011 20:30:18]  <Loki_Weyland> (Well, crap. There goes the plot.)
[14-Aug-2011 20:30:26]  <Gendo> (lol)
[14-Aug-2011 20:30:49]  * Motoko opens mouth to protest, but is immediately stifled by the atmosphere
[14-Aug-2011 20:31:07]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland, Cassie:  For the record, the stuff happening with Motoko is a couple hours before you guys arrive at the airport.
[14-Aug-2011 20:31:15]  <Loki_Weyland> Ah.
[14-Aug-2011 20:31:22]  <Loki_Weyland> Might want to make that clear next time.
[14-Aug-2011 20:31:24]  <Motoko> Understood. I may be a bit longer than an hour, though. Place is a mess.
[14-Aug-2011 20:31:28]  <Loki_Weyland> For future reference.
[14-Aug-2011 20:31:41]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland, Cassie:  Yeah, sorry >.>
[14-Aug-2011 20:31:43]  * Motoko wanders off to pack
[14-Aug-2011 20:31:51]  <Loki_Weyland> It happens.
[14-Aug-2011 20:31:54]  * Gendo skips time.

[14-Aug-2011 20:32:50]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [aw come on, it ain't so bad. it's just a flashback!]
[14-Aug-2011 20:33:26]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland, Cassie:  A black SUV pulls up, and a man dressed in an equally black suit gets out of the drivers seat.  He is holding a sign that says "Cassie & Loki".
[14-Aug-2011 20:33:41]  <Gendo> (Yes, this is the same man that was at Motoko's place)
[14-Aug-2011 20:33:51]  <Loki_Weyland> Ah. Finally.
[14-Aug-2011 20:33:58]  *** Rei <~chatzilla@S0106002191d86b2c.no.shawcable.net> has joined #MadokaMadness
[14-Aug-2011 20:33:59]  <Motoko> Must resist temptation to say "sitting in a tree". Must resist. Must resist...
[14-Aug-2011 20:33:59]  * Loki_Weyland walks over to the man.
[14-Aug-2011 20:34:28]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: He takes your luggage, and places in the rear of the SUV. 
[14-Aug-2011 20:34:34]  <Loki_Weyland> (Guys, my connection might be cutting out. Just so you know.)
[14-Aug-2011 20:34:35]  <Cassie> Cassie walks over to the man and gives a quick salute.
[14-Aug-2011 20:34:47]  <Gendo> Cassie: He does the same for you.
[14-Aug-2011 20:35:33]  <Loki_Weyland> (Never mind, it's just YouTube's servers derping up.)
[14-Aug-2011 20:35:39]  <Gendo> He then opens the rear door of the SUV, for you two to sit.  Inside the SUV is a young Japanese girl, with hair that is longish, not on fire.   :p
[14-Aug-2011 20:35:57]  * Loki_Weyland gets in the SUV.
[14-Aug-2011 20:35:58]  <Motoko> Ah, hello.
[14-Aug-2011 20:36:07]  <Loki_Weyland> Hi.
[14-Aug-2011 20:36:14]  <Loki_Weyland> ...You are?
[14-Aug-2011 20:36:26]  <Cassie> Hello. I was briefed that I was meeting two other pilots today?
[14-Aug-2011 20:36:31]  <Gendo> (Also, for the record, Cassie and Loki_Weyland both know exactly what they're getting into.  They know about the existence of the Evangelions, and the pilots)
[14-Aug-2011 20:36:42]  <Motoko> Motoko Iwatani. And you are... pilots?
[14-Aug-2011 20:36:44]  <Loki_Weyland> (Right.)
[14-Aug-2011 20:36:50]  <Loki_Weyland> 'Fraid so.
[14-Aug-2011 20:37:02]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki Weyland's the name.
[14-Aug-2011 20:37:09]  <Loki_Weyland> You?
[14-Aug-2011 20:37:15]  * Loki_Weyland motions to Cassie.
[14-Aug-2011 20:37:53]  <Cassie> Cassie stumbles a little bit and then blurts out "Evangelion Unit 14 pilot Cassandra Schneider reporting"
[14-Aug-2011 20:37:59]  <Motoko> Airplane pilots? You're both pretty young for tha -
[14-Aug-2011 20:38:11]  <Gendo> The man returns to the seat and begins to drive...
[14-Aug-2011 20:38:48]  <Loki_Weyland> Evangelions are a bit bigger than airplanes.
[14-Aug-2011 20:38:49]  * Motoko ( ﾟДﾟ)ﾊｧ?
[14-Aug-2011 20:38:55]  <Cassie> I don't know how to fly a plane. I do however know how to escape one in several emergencies.
[14-Aug-2011 20:39:09]  <Loki_Weyland> Useful knowledge.
[14-Aug-2011 20:39:27]  <Lou> [Huh.  NERV is just foreign romanization, not an acronym.  Yay, knowledge!]
[14-Aug-2011 20:39:33]  <Cassie> I take it you haven't had a chance to practice with the drop planes yet Pilot Loki?
[14-Aug-2011 20:39:40]  <Gendo> (I figure I'll allow a bit of exposition to Motoko here, before I skip to the arrival at NERV)
[14-Aug-2011 20:39:43]  <Loki_Weyland> Nope.
[14-Aug-2011 20:39:46]  <Motoko> Must be mecha otaku...
[14-Aug-2011 20:39:52]  * Motoko waves hands, attempts to go back to sleep
[14-Aug-2011 20:39:59]  <Cassie> Freefall is an interesting experience.
[14-Aug-2011 20:40:07]  <Loki_Weyland> That's beside the point, Motoko.
[14-Aug-2011 20:40:34]  <Loki_Weyland> As for freefall, it's something I'm curious about yet not keen to experience just yet.
[14-Aug-2011 20:41:38]  <Cassie> Well then we can only hope for an airborn angel to kill, can't we?
[14-Aug-2011 20:41:44]  <Loki_Weyland> Should be fun.
[14-Aug-2011 20:42:04]  <Motoko> Freefall? Like "getting pushed off of a tall building" freefall? What is... um, guys...?
[14-Aug-2011 20:42:20]  <Loki_Weyland> Don't worry, you'll find out soon enough.
[14-Aug-2011 20:42:24]  <Cassie> Which Evangelion are you charged with controlling Pilot Loki?
[14-Aug-2011 20:42:36]  <Gendo> The SUV pulls into what appears to be a military base.  Large conrete walls topped with barbed-wire on either side of the road, and a checkpoint by armed personnel.  The drivers flashes an ID, and the gate is lifted, allowing him to drive through.
[14-Aug-2011 20:42:38]  <Loki_Weyland> Unit 05.
[14-Aug-2011 20:43:53]  * Motoko goes wide-eyed in incomprehension
[14-Aug-2011 20:44:14]  * Loki_Weyland is enjoying Motoko's confusion a bit too much.
[14-Aug-2011 20:44:20]  <Gendo> He pulls into a parking garage filled with identical black SUVs, parks, and motions you three out.
[14-Aug-2011 20:44:32]  <Cassie> You don't know what an Evangelion is, do you Pilot Motoko?
[14-Aug-2011 20:44:38]  * Loki_Weyland gets out.
[14-Aug-2011 20:44:54]  <Motoko> Sorry, I only understood about two of those words.
[14-Aug-2011 20:44:56]  <Loki_Weyland> Shush, don't spoil it!
[14-Aug-2011 20:45:09]  <Gendo> "Follow me.  Your luggage will be brought to your rooms later."
[14-Aug-2011 20:45:11]  <Motoko> You two... aren't from around here, are you?
[14-Aug-2011 20:45:14]  <Loki_Weyland> Nope.
[14-Aug-2011 20:45:18]  <Cassie> I find it hard to spoil something that is common knowledge.
[14-Aug-2011 20:45:26]  <Loki_Weyland> Well, she doesn't know.
[14-Aug-2011 20:45:40]  <Gendo> The man begins to walk to an elevator (I'm assuming you guys follow as you chat).
[14-Aug-2011 20:45:40]  <Loki_Weyland> It'll be a fun surprise!
[14-Aug-2011 20:45:54]  <Motoko> 14How "common knowledge" *is* this? I got mixed signals from the rulebook.
[14-Aug-2011 20:46:10]  <Gendo> Motoko: At the moment, Evangelions are secret from the public.
[14-Aug-2011 20:46:18]  <Cassie> Cassandra smiles for the first time since meeting the others and mouth's fun.
[14-Aug-2011 20:46:43]  <Gendo> As is the Marduk Society.  NERV is thought to be a kind of international scientific research organization.
[14-Aug-2011 20:47:07]  <Loki_Weyland> (So, slight retcon there.)
[14-Aug-2011 20:47:19]  <Gendo> The floors in the elevator are liste 1 - b25.  He pushes the button for b25.
[14-Aug-2011 20:47:46]  * Loki_Weyland gets in the elevator.
[14-Aug-2011 20:47:54]  <Cassie> 14Lets just assume Cassie is talking out her ass. She has a military background and doesn't really know what the average public person knows.
[14-Aug-2011 20:48:01]  <Loki_Weyland> OK.
[14-Aug-2011 20:48:04]  <Gendo> (Sorry, this common knowledge thing is something I should have addressed arelier).
[14-Aug-2011 20:48:18]  * Loki_Weyland hops, enjoying the slight decrease in gees.
[14-Aug-2011 20:48:23]  <Gendo> The elevator begins to go down.  And down.  And down.  And down even more.
[14-Aug-2011 20:49:09]  * Motoko eyes Loki_Weyland, tries jumping up and down a couple of times when the elevator comes to a (sudden) stop
[14-Aug-2011 20:49:29]  <Gendo> After about 5 minutes, the glass windows on the sides suddenly brighten, as a giant underground cavern, several kilometers across, is revealed.  
[14-Aug-2011 20:49:43]  <Loki_Weyland> Cooooooool...
[14-Aug-2011 20:49:47]  <Gendo> Visible in the center is a lake, surrounded by a forest.
[14-Aug-2011 20:50:00]  <Cassie> The architectural bracing required must be staggering...
[14-Aug-2011 20:50:08]  <Lou> [Wow, it's been forever since I've been in an elevator that went to more than three floors.  I forgot how slow they can be. :/]
[14-Aug-2011 20:50:11]  <Gendo> It is unseen what illuminates the cavern, though it is about as bright underground as a cloudy would be above ground.
[14-Aug-2011 20:50:14]  <Motoko> Ow, that was a bad... weren't we going... down?
[14-Aug-2011 20:50:15]  <Loki_Weyland> I hope so, Cassie.
[14-Aug-2011 20:50:30]  <Loki_Weyland> No, we are.
[14-Aug-2011 20:50:52]  <Cassie> NERV Toronto had underground sections, but never anything this deep.
[14-Aug-2011 20:51:09]  <Loki_Weyland> This place is well fortified.
[14-Aug-2011 20:51:13]  <Loki_Weyland> And well funded.
[14-Aug-2011 20:51:47]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: That's one hella slow elevator. 25 floors at 10 m per floor = 3 km/h. >_>
[14-Aug-2011 20:52:15]  <Lou> [/me scribbles in a zero after the twenty-five]
[14-Aug-2011 20:52:17]  <Cassie> 14Better than the kilometer tall escalators.
[14-Aug-2011 20:53:06]  <Gendo> After a couple more minutes, the elevator enters another structure, the bell rings, and the doors open into a highly polished hallway.
[14-Aug-2011 20:53:37]  <Loki_Weyland> This place just keeps getting better. I'm going to like it here.
[14-Aug-2011 20:53:54]  <Motoko> 14Floor -250: Women's apparel, children's toys, superweapon research and development...
[14-Aug-2011 20:53:57]  <Gendo> Waiting for you is a Japanese woman, about late 20s, early 30s
[14-Aug-2011 20:54:27]  <Cassie> Cassie salutes her.

[14-Aug-2011 20:54:44]  <Gendo> Cassie: She salutes back.
[14-Aug-2011 20:55:11]  <Gendo> "That will be all, Agent Dulles", she says. The man accompanying you three nods, and returns to the elevator.
[14-Aug-2011 20:55:22]  * Motoko looks around in silence
[14-Aug-2011 20:55:57]  <Gendo> "I am Colonel Shizuko Ishihara.  Welcome to the NERV headquarters, Cassie, Loki, and Motoko."

[14-Aug-2011 20:57:14]  <Cassie> What is our assignment Colonel Ishihara?
[14-Aug-2011 20:57:17]  <Loki_Weyland> Lou: (It's probably to make the pilots feel at ease.)
[14-Aug-2011 20:57:23]  <Gendo> Behind the woman, you can see two boys.  One appears to be of questionable nationality, and, most strikingly, is albino.
[14-Aug-2011 20:58:11]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [Questionable?]
[14-Aug-2011 20:58:14]  <Gendo> The second is European, probably Russian.  He looks rather rugged, with well kept military cut hair, and brown eyes.
[14-Aug-2011 20:58:27]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [oh.]
[14-Aug-2011 20:58:46]  * Lou is standing seemingly at attention.  He stares at the three in turn, then relaxes a bit.

[14-Aug-2011 20:59:10]  <Loki_Weyland> (That made me laugh.)
[14-Aug-2011 20:59:13]  <Loki_Weyland> Yo.
[14-Aug-2011 20:59:29]  <Motoko> (in a somewhat low voice) Hello.
[14-Aug-2011 20:59:40]  * Lou bows and smiles slightly.  "Hello."
[14-Aug-2011 20:59:43]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [nerv japan, this base would be called, right?]
[14-Aug-2011 20:59:47]  <Cassie> Pleasure to meet your Pilot Lou and Pilor Osip Zghun
[14-Aug-2011 21:00:08]  <Loki_Weyland> Do you have a last name, Lou?
[14-Aug-2011 21:00:16]  <Gendo> "As for your assignments, Cassie, I will be escorting you to be briefed by Dr. Murai."
[14-Aug-2011 21:00:19]  <Lou> Of course.
[14-Aug-2011 21:00:27]  <Loki_Weyland> Mind telling us what it is?
[14-Aug-2011 21:00:36]  <Cassie> Cassie tilts her head and asks "Befriended?"
[14-Aug-2011 21:00:40]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip nods towards the three newcomers, quietly. [sorry about being late on that one]
[14-Aug-2011 21:00:50]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> nods at*
[14-Aug-2011 21:01:30]  <Lou> Classified!
[14-Aug-2011 21:01:30]  <Lou> /me 's smile fails to strengthen
[14-Aug-2011 21:01:37]  <Loki_Weyland> Hm.
[14-Aug-2011 21:01:52]  <Gendo> "Follow me if you will.  I will try to answer any questions that I can about myself, and the NERV facilities on the way."
[14-Aug-2011 21:02:30]  <Loki_Weyland> OK.
[14-Aug-2011 21:02:33]  <Cassie> How close will our quarters be to our Evangelions?
[14-Aug-2011 21:02:39]  <Gendo> Col. Ishihara begins to lead the way through a series of halls.
[14-Aug-2011 21:03:24]  * Lou follows Ishihara, attempting to stay behind everybody.
[14-Aug-2011 21:03:35]  *** Rei_ <~chatzilla@S0106001a92b64fd8.no.shawcable.net> has joined #MadokaMadness
[14-Aug-2011 21:03:37]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip follows in concert with the others.
[14-Aug-2011 21:03:56]  *** Rei_ <~chatzilla@S0106001a92b64fd8.no.shawcable.net> has left #MadokaMadness
[14-Aug-2011 21:04:04]  <Gendo> "Tonight, you will be housed here in NERV facilities.  However, as you are still of student age, and education is important, you will be moved up to the surface to live with a handler and attend Tokyo-3 Municipal High School."
[14-Aug-2011 21:04:04]  <Motoko> 14Are we all being briefed, or just Cassie?
[14-Aug-2011 21:04:11]  <Gendo> (High school name subject to change)
[14-Aug-2011 21:04:18]  <Loki_Weyland> Joy.
[14-Aug-2011 21:04:22]  <Gendo> Motoko: You're all following, presumably, so you all hear this.
[14-Aug-2011 21:04:48]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [have I been briefed seperately already? or would it be apporpirate to voice my concerns about attending a high school at age 20?]
[14-Aug-2011 21:04:54]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: Phone Microwave High School (name subject to change).
[14-Aug-2011 21:05:12]  <Lou> [Obvious joke is obvious.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:05:28]  <Cassie> Cassie pales. "Can I have a transfer to another assignment from the student mission? I do not feel my Japanese reading skills are adequate to the task of high school education."
[14-Aug-2011 21:05:32]  * Motoko breathes a sigh of relief
[14-Aug-2011 21:05:36]  <Gendo> [Barcode]Osip_Zhgun: You have been briefed already.  (I honestly haven't thought out something for you.  I'm playing with the idea of having you teach P.E. at the high school :P)
[14-Aug-2011 21:05:44]  *** Rei <~chatzilla@S0106001e58eeaf74.no.shawcable.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 186 seconds)
[14-Aug-2011 21:05:56]  <Loki_Weyland> Gendo: [Oh, that'll be interesting.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:06:01]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [Hah. Alright then. :P]
[14-Aug-2011 21:06:22]  <Loki_Weyland> [I'm imagining a Georgian Sgt. Hartmann.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:06:44]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [Hooray, I (might) get to RP from the perspective of my horrendously incoherent Indian profs]
[14-Aug-2011 21:06:53]  * Motoko 14immediately thinks of Phil Hartman...
[14-Aug-2011 21:07:29]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [cobbleboh = combo box, esquire = square, , curly lao = ???]
[14-Aug-2011 21:07:29]  <Loki_Weyland> Cassie: Guess we'll just have to learn as we go. I'm not that familiar with the language myself.
[14-Aug-2011 21:07:29]  <Gendo> Cassie: Tutoring services will be available, and NERV will make arrangements with the school to accomodate.  It is imperative that you associate with your fellow pilots outside of NERV.
[14-Aug-2011 21:07:37]  <Gendo> (brb)
[14-Aug-2011 21:07:37]  <Loki_Weyland> Oh, cool.
[14-Aug-2011 21:08:06]  <Wilhelm> (Barcode: ah, trying to understand foreign professors)
[14-Aug-2011 21:08:12]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: Can we have a brief keyboard break? My wrists, being the old things they are, are flaring up.
[14-Aug-2011 21:08:30]  <Loki_Weyland> [Wilhelm: Try understanding a deaf teacher. Oi.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:08:44]  <Loki_Weyland> [Granted, the class was ASL. Still, she was a hardass.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:06]  <Gendo> (Alright, keyboard break has been requested.  I shall grant the wish.)
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:10]  <Gendo> Entering meta....
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:13]  <Gendo> NOW
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:15]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> fUCK
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:22]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> I was just about to type my first spoken dialogue line
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:22]  <Motoko> All right, be back in five.
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:24]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> .
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:24]  <Loki_Weyland> Motoko: [Shout really loudly. We might hear you.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:40]  <Gendo> I think I'll take this time to go grab a cup of coffee.
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:49]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> but seeing how fucking slow I am at making any decisions at all perhaps I wil ljust remain mute for the rest of the series
[14-Aug-2011 21:09:56]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> (and take −10 to agility)
[14-Aug-2011 21:10:16]  <Loki_Weyland> No, no! Being mute is a disadvantage, so that means you have extra XP to spend!
[14-Aug-2011 21:10:31]  <Gendo> Haha.
[14-Aug-2011 21:10:40]  <Cassie> It also means you are 20% cuter to filthy otakus
[14-Aug-2011 21:10:45]  <Gendo> And sorry, [Barcode]Osip_Zhgun, Lou, for taking so long to get to you guys >.>
[14-Aug-2011 21:10:51]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Oh no problem at all
[14-Aug-2011 21:11:08]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> teh only consequence was that I took 15 minutes to decide for my character to do anything but do his best statue impression

[14-Aug-2011 21:11:13]  <Cassie> So what is the title of our first episode?
[14-Aug-2011 21:11:13]  <Lou> [It's fine.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:11:23]  <Lou> Er, *It's fine.
[14-Aug-2011 21:11:34]  <Gendo> Cassie: Lemme go think of something totally symbolic, and totally bullshit.
[14-Aug-2011 21:11:46]  <Loki_Weyland> Cassie: The One With the Meetings?
[14-Aug-2011 21:11:48]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> This Is (Not) The Beginning Of Your Adventure
[14-Aug-2011 21:11:53]  <Loki_Weyland> Ha.
[14-Aug-2011 21:11:55]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> "Adventure"*
[14-Aug-2011 21:12:13]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> horror-fying monstrosities from spess and all.
[14-Aug-2011 21:12:16]  <Lou> An Unfamiliar Elevator System
[14-Aug-2011 21:12:46]  <Cassie> Loki - what's that naming scheme from again?
[14-Aug-2011 21:12:58]  <Lou> The One With whatever
[14-Aug-2011 21:13:05]  <Loki_Weyland> Friends, I think.
[14-Aug-2011 21:13:06]  <Lou> or The One Where
[14-Aug-2011 21:13:12]  <Loki_Weyland> Never seen an episode, myself.
[14-Aug-2011 21:13:27]  <Lou> Oh.  Misread >_>
[14-Aug-2011 21:13:53]  <Cassie> http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/14668953/ <-- Is this our Commander?
[14-Aug-2011 21:13:54]  <Omnipresence> 14URL: [suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com] /tg/ - Traditional Games
[14-Aug-2011 21:14:10]  <Lou> Knew it would be that thread.
[14-Aug-2011 21:14:12]  <Gendo> Cassie:  No, though it was tempting.
[14-Aug-2011 21:14:37]  <Gendo> You probably won't meet the commander this session, though you will likely see him from a distance.
[14-Aug-2011 21:14:44]  <Gendo> Might meet the sub-commander, though.
[14-Aug-2011 21:14:55]  <Lou> Our commander is the G-Man!
[14-Aug-2011 21:15:40]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Only if he immediately makes a point of disappearing around a corner.
[14-Aug-2011 21:15:53]  * Lou shoots madly to no effect
[14-Aug-2011 21:16:00]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> sparks fly off our boss.
[14-Aug-2011 21:16:17]  <Gendo> Also, as you guys may have noticed, you type faster than I do.  Which is totally fine.  Unlike real life, talking amongst yourselves in front of super-serious higher-ups is somewhat acceptable here.  
[14-Aug-2011 21:16:23]  <Loki_Weyland> Cassie: This is fucking brilliant.
[14-Aug-2011 21:16:38]  <Lou> Have you seriously not read that thread before, Jbridge...?
[14-Aug-2011 21:17:28]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Loki_Weyland: Destroying an entire space shuttle as a hacker droid, fuck yeah.
[14-Aug-2011 21:17:32]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> space station*
[14-Aug-2011 21:17:39]  <Loki_Weyland> I know.
[14-Aug-2011 21:17:44]  <Loki_Weyland> The rest of the thread is gold, too.
[14-Aug-2011 21:18:27]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> in typing up something to do once the game starts again, I was about to say "Osip's japanese is strangely formal". THen I realized that Japanese is in and of itself strangely formal.
[14-Aug-2011 21:18:41]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> (strangely formal meaning, it's what a high school/instruction book would teach you)
[14-Aug-2011 21:18:51]  <Lou> You can speak it informally... and a learner would speak formally, yeah.
[14-Aug-2011 21:19:05]  <Motoko> Not really. Instructional books go for a middle ground w/r/t formality.
[14-Aug-2011 21:19:58]  <Motoko> Really highly formal honorific language generally isn't taught to begin with.
[14-Aug-2011 21:20:05]  <Gendo> Oh, I should mention it now:  None of you know what really happened during Second Impact.
[14-Aug-2011 21:20:24]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> K.
[14-Aug-2011 21:20:25]  <Cassie> What year is it again?
[14-Aug-2011 21:20:28]  * Lou may have been extrapolating from his own, BNF-ridden approach to languages
[14-Aug-2011 21:20:30]  <Gendo> 2016.

[14-Aug-2011 21:20:59]  <Cassie> Oh. Then me and Loki were born right around there, true Eva pilot fashion.
[14-Aug-2011 21:21:10]  <Gendo> Yup.
[14-Aug-2011 21:21:29]  <Gendo> Also, I just noticed that I totally fucked up the chronology.  Possibly.
[14-Aug-2011 21:21:35]  <Gendo> (Nothing big, mind you)
[14-Aug-2011 21:21:40]  <Motoko> I think everyone was, [Barcode]Osip_Zhgun aside.
[14-Aug-2011 21:22:34]  <Cassie> BNF?

[14-Aug-2011 21:23:19]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> bid not finish?
[14-Aug-2011 21:23:20]  <Lou> Indeed.
[14-Aug-2011 21:23:22]  <Gendo> Assuming that Motoko went to a school in a different city, as is common for Japanese students, she probably got home at close to 8 P.M. which would put the airport scene at about 11:00 pm......  I'm treating this as if its late afternoon >.<  (not that anyone really cares).
[14-Aug-2011 21:23:43]  <Motoko> Gendo: Or perhaps we skipped over a night.
[14-Aug-2011 21:23:59]  <Cassie> "Oh, they're Angels? Well wowee, that sure makes a big difference to little old me. Guess we'd better all curl up in our beds and pray God kills us quick. Shut the hell up! Humans ate that damn banana from the Tree of Knowledge, and goddamn have we made a good life from it. HDTV's. iwhatchamacallits. Devil's Food Cake. God doesn't have that! He's just jealous
[14-Aug-2011 21:24:09]  <Cassie> So let's take a stand people, and let's give God an asswhooping he won't forget!"
[14-Aug-2011 21:24:17]  <Gendo> Motoko: Possible, but I think I'm just going to handwave it.
[14-Aug-2011 21:24:30]  <Gendo> Motoko: Like I said, it's not important, really.
[14-Aug-2011 21:24:37]  <Motoko> For the record, I'm pretending to be from Fukuoka, so it's doubtful anyone could drive that in 3 hours ;)
[14-Aug-2011 21:24:52]  <Lou> Dulles is secretly a drag car racer.
[14-Aug-2011 21:25:08]  <Gendo> Motoko: Well, since Tokyo-3 isn't in the same area as the original Tokyo, who knows?  
[14-Aug-2011 21:25:18]  <Cassie> He doesn't win a lot though. He drives a Prius.
[14-Aug-2011 21:25:21]  <Lou> Where's Tokyo 3 again?  H something
[14-Aug-2011 21:25:31]  <Motoko> Also, Dulles? We're naming a guy after Eisenhower's Secretary of State/an airport?
[14-Aug-2011 21:25:50]  <Gendo> Motoko: Allen Dulles?  Probably.  
[14-Aug-2011 21:25:55]  <Lou> Hakone, right.
[14-Aug-2011 21:25:58]  <Motoko> (not that I think it's *bad*, just funny)
[14-Aug-2011 21:26:05]  <Gendo> Yeah, hence the name.
[14-Aug-2011 21:26:12]  <Gendo> I found it funny, too.
[14-Aug-2011 21:26:40]  <Cassie> All Section 2 agents have code names related to historical government personel
[14-Aug-2011 21:26:41]  <Motoko> "For a brief period in 2010, [Hakone] tried to leverage this as a publicity stunt for the Rebuild of Evangelion series, but canceled plans when the show's fanbase literally overran the town and began disrupting school and work."
[14-Aug-2011 21:26:51]  <Gendo> Cassie: Sure, lets go with that.
[14-Aug-2011 21:27:00]  <Cassie> At least this is my head canon.
[14-Aug-2011 21:27:02]  <Lou> Oh wow, that is still a hell of a drive.
[14-Aug-2011 21:27:14]  <Loki_Weyland> Hakone is supposedly known for its hot springs. That's why Pen-Pen is there.
[14-Aug-2011 21:27:18]  <Gendo> Yeah, handwaved.
[14-Aug-2011 21:27:20]  <Motoko> Hakone's not too far from Tokyo proper, though. Just the next prefecture over.
[14-Aug-2011 21:27:28]  <Loki_Weyland> Because a penguin is the one animal you'd never see at a hot spring.
[14-Aug-2011 21:27:50]  <Gendo> HANDWAVED FOR FUCK'S SAKE
[14-Aug-2011 21:27:53]  <Gendo> Alright.
[14-Aug-2011 21:27:58]  <Gendo> Are we all ready to start up again?
[14-Aug-2011 21:28:13]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Yes. Also, Vegans: people from Las Vegas?
[14-Aug-2011 21:28:15]  <Lou> my wrists are literally *EXPLODING* from pain
[14-Aug-2011 21:28:20]  <Lou> but I can soldier on
[14-Aug-2011 21:28:40]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> what
[14-Aug-2011 21:28:42]  <Gendo> ...
[14-Aug-2011 21:28:45]  <Gendo> I think he's joking.
[14-Aug-2011 21:28:54]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> u_u
[14-Aug-2011 21:29:13]  <Gendo> (I'm waiting for an affirmative from everyone before I resume game)
[14-Aug-2011 21:29:30]  <Cassie> My body is ready
[14-Aug-2011 21:29:45]  <Gendo> Alright, 3/5.....
[14-Aug-2011 21:29:49]  <Motoko> 4
[14-Aug-2011 21:29:50]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Codesaw is ready. A note, however, that I will likely be inturrupted for dinner. I will try to keep up but I might have to put the computer down.
[14-Aug-2011 21:29:53]  <Loki_Weyland> I'm ready.
[14-Aug-2011 21:30:00]  <Gendo> Alright, exiting Meta....
[14-Aug-2011 21:30:02]  <Gendo> Now!
[14-Aug-2011 21:30:25]  <Gendo> (if you still have questions about Shizuko, or the NERV facility, ask them now)
[14-Aug-2011 21:30:30]  <Cassie> I might be delayed because of a phone call I'm expecting.
[14-Aug-2011 21:30:31]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [oh uh btw how long have lou and I been here for]
[14-Aug-2011 21:31:02]  <Gendo> [Barcode]Osip_Zhgun: You arrived as soon as Lou did, and have been here for about 3 months.
[14-Aug-2011 21:31:02]  * Motoko would not even know where to begin with questions
[14-Aug-2011 21:31:14]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [and what is the name of this base again? JAPAN-3 or something? And I see.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:31:36]  <Lou> Is something the matter, Motoko?
[14-Aug-2011 21:31:43]  <Gendo> [Barcode]Osip_Zhgun: The city is Tokyo-3.  The base is NERV-HQ.
[14-Aug-2011 21:31:50]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [Ah, okay. thx.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:31:55]  <Gendo> (argh, phone...)
[14-Aug-2011 21:32:11]  <Gendo> (nvm)
[14-Aug-2011 21:32:45]  <Lou> ["Indeed, this is part of the beauty of AdEva. You can run it wherever the fuck you want and all the mechanics are there. You could run it entirely in outer space if you wanted, although this isn't really recommended."  How...?]
[14-Aug-2011 21:33:14]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [Well, everyone still dies, for one. It just happens for a different reason]
[14-Aug-2011 21:33:17]  <Loki_Weyland> [So, where were we?]
[14-Aug-2011 21:33:27]  <Cassie> I remember an outer space Eva rig in the equipment sheet.
[14-Aug-2011 21:33:52]  <Cassie> [Probably about to get the "This is the Geofront" speech]
[14-Aug-2011 21:33:58]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip smiles very lightly as he hears of Cassie's predicament. "Ah. Your predicament, it is like mine." His Japanese is heavily accented.
[14-Aug-2011 21:34:01]  <Loki_Weyland> Cassie: [Great, now I'm imagining an EVA taking off from a launch strip a la Gundam.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:34:01]  <Lou> [We were following Colonel Iforgothername to somewhere.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:34:22]  <Motoko> I'm just a little... overwhelmed... Lou, was it? Sorry if I forget your name.
[14-Aug-2011 21:34:36]  <Loki_Weyland> Lou: [Ishikawa? Something like that.]

[14-Aug-2011 21:34:56]  <Gendo> Cassie: [Actually, the "This is the Geofront" speech won't be given until someone asks XD]

[14-Aug-2011 21:36:27]  *** Spacebar <~CM-2a@71-214-102-121.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #MadokaMadness
[14-Aug-2011 21:36:54]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: [You guys were following Col. Ishihara, and will conveniently get to your destination when questions are all answered.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:37:01]  <Loki_Weyland> So, what is this place, exactly? I've read up some, but I don't think I read anything about an underground arcology.
[14-Aug-2011 21:37:22]  <Loki_Weyland> Wait- it's probably not an arcology.
[14-Aug-2011 21:37:37]  <Loki_Weyland> Arcologies are self-sustained.
[14-Aug-2011 21:37:39]  <Loki_Weyland> So what is it?
[14-Aug-2011 21:37:58]  <Gendo> "Ah, yes, I was expecting one of you to ask this eventually (:P).  This is what we call a GeoFront."
[14-Aug-2011 21:38:06]  <Motoko> Lou: I was at school a couple of hours ago, right? And I don't know when or why or how, but someone's drove me through a million miles through a time-traveling wormhole and I don't understand half of the words that anyone is using...
[14-Aug-2011 21:38:06]  <Gendo> (lots of typing incoming, be patient)
[14-Aug-2011 21:38:22]  <Loki_Weyland> [Being patient.]

[14-Aug-2011 21:39:21]  <Loki_Weyland> [It really feels like the UNATCO theme should be playing.]
[14-Aug-2011 21:39:22]  <Motoko> Like that word, GeoFront!
[14-Aug-2011 21:39:42]  <Loki_Weyland> It sounds very enterprisey.
[14-Aug-2011 21:40:16]  * Lou whispers to Motoko due to the Colonel starting - "You haven't undergone... why... Well, just listen to Colonel Ishihara, she must have planned for you."
[14-Aug-2011 21:41:10]  <Motoko> Lou: ...I don't like those words, "planned for me"...
[14-Aug-2011 21:42:10]  <Gendo> "The GeoFront is subterranean, as you must have noticed in the elevator.  It was created as part of the defenses required by NERV facilities.  The trees and lake were gradually introduced, and mirros on the surface funnel in daylight to sustain the vegetation."
[14-Aug-2011 21:42:28]  <Cassie> Cassie nods at Osip. "Yes. I personally don't see the point of sending us to high school. We will never have a normal life, so why pretend?"
[14-Aug-2011 21:43:48]  <Gendo> "Every NERV base has a Geofront, but only those cleared for it are allowed into it, and the most important areas of each base are kept in the GeoFront."
[14-Aug-2011 21:43:54]  <Loki_Weyland> Neat.
[14-Aug-2011 21:43:55]  <Lou> "Planning is important, Motoko."  Lou's expression is serious.  "Now we should listen."
[14-Aug-2011 21:43:58]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> (Osip stops before he begins, mindful of not interrupting the Colonel.)
[14-Aug-2011 21:44:20]  <Lou> [Cassie lived in NERV Toronto but didn't know there was a geofront?]
[14-Aug-2011 21:44:30]  <Gendo> "While not entirely self-sufficient, there is enough down here to sustain a large population for several months, should the need occur."
[14-Aug-2011 21:44:36]  <Loki_Weyland> Sweet.
[14-Aug-2011 21:44:47]  <Cassie> 14Apparently they weren't cleared to use it.
[14-Aug-2011 21:44:54]  <Gendo> Lou: [Exactly.  She wasn't cleared for it.  Neither was Loki_Weyland].

[14-Aug-2011 21:46:24]  <Gendo> "The most useful aspect of Tokyo-3's GeoFront, is that the city above ground has been built to retract down into the GeoFront, should there be imminent danger to the city.  Danger from what is what Dr. Murai will be covering."
[14-Aug-2011 21:46:37]  <Gendo> "Any more questions?"
[14-Aug-2011 21:46:48]  <Loki_Weyland> Nope.
[14-Aug-2011 21:47:03]  <Loki_Weyland> I think I'm too busy ogling at all the expensive tech to ask questions.
[14-Aug-2011 21:47:48]  <Gendo> [That offer extends to everyone.  Otherwise, I'm moving on with the story]
[14-Aug-2011 21:48:13]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip remains silent, smile faded in response to the Colonel's speech.
[14-Aug-2011 21:48:16]  * Motoko continues to be too brain-liquefied to ask anything
[14-Aug-2011 21:48:28]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [in response as in "well, focusing on that now" as opposed to "oh how grimdark]
[14-Aug-2011 21:48:30]  * Lou frowns.  Why isn't he taking this seriously?
[14-Aug-2011 21:49:19]  <Gendo> Just as Col. Ishihara finishes her exposition, she stops in front of a set of heavy doors.  The sign above the doors read "Cage Observatory".  
[14-Aug-2011 21:50:40]  <Gendo> She swipes an identification card, and the doors slide open, revealing the interior of the room.  It is staffed by at 12 people, at computers, with a large window peering into a dark room on the wall opposite the doors..  A gentleman who appears to be in his early 30s turns to the group, expectantly.
[14-Aug-2011 21:52:24]  * Lou straightens up to attention again.
[14-Aug-2011 21:52:35]  <Gendo> "Dr. Murai, these are the pilots.  You have already met Lou," she motions at him, "and these are Loki Weyland, Motoko Iwatani, and Cassie (insert surname here)", she motions to each of them.
[14-Aug-2011 21:52:46]  <Loki_Weyland> Hey.
[14-Aug-2011 21:53:14]  <Gendo> Dr. Murai takes over....
[14-Aug-2011 21:54:03]  <Gendo> "I am Dr. Jun Murai, head of NERV's science and technology department, and head or Project-E.  I believe that all of you know what an Evangelion is, save for our newest pilot, Motoko.  Am I correct?"
[14-Aug-2011 21:54:15]  <Motoko> Ah, uh, yes, sir...
[14-Aug-2011 21:54:19]  * Lou nods
[14-Aug-2011 21:54:24]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip nods in agreement.
[14-Aug-2011 21:54:31]  * Motoko flinches inwardly at being singled out
[14-Aug-2011 21:54:59]  <Gendo> "Well, before I explain, perhaps it would be better if you saw them for yourself first."
[14-Aug-2011 21:55:58]  <Loki_Weyland> Oh, this is going to be fun.
[14-Aug-2011 21:56:07]  * Loki_Weyland grins wider than normal.
[14-Aug-2011 21:56:56]  * Lou glances over at Motoko, still worried
[14-Aug-2011 21:57:06]  <Gendo> As he finishes his sentence, the lights in the room beyond the glass turn on (almost as if preplanned), revealing 4 giant robotic heads.  While it is hard to measure the scale, the heads are the only things really visible, and are easy a ways away.  The actual machines they are attached to mush measure at least 650 feet tall.
[14-Aug-2011 21:57:33]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip tightens his lips slightly in a faint expression of disapproval. He glances stealthily for Motoko's reaction.
[14-Aug-2011 21:57:46]  <Loki_Weyland> ...It's even more glorious than I'd hoped.
[14-Aug-2011 21:58:12]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [well. glances stealthily. cloaked eyelids yo u_u]
[14-Aug-2011 21:58:22]  * Lou does not react.
[14-Aug-2011 21:59:42]  * Motoko continues to be visibly shaken, but only lets a quiet "that's huge..." escape lips
[14-Aug-2011 22:00:27]  <Gendo> "These are the Evangelions, mankind's greatest weapons.  You may be wondering why these weapons have been created.  The answer is complex.  To simplify it, we have substantial proof that there creatures that exist that pose a great threat to the Human Race.  These Evangelions have been constructed to combat these creatures."
[14-Aug-2011 22:00:32]  <Motoko> 14650 feet? You mean 200 metres, tsk tsk.
[14-Aug-2011 22:01:15]  <Gendo> Motoko: [yeah, I know.  I'm using the measure that we're more likely to be familiar with]
[14-Aug-2011 22:01:26]  <Motoko> ...(inaudible)an, like aliens?
[14-Aug-2011 22:01:38]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [200 metres tall, huh? Well, I suppose in some screenshots I've seen, the Evas were fucking huge, but….]
[14-Aug-2011 22:02:05]  <Loki_Weyland> [I thought they were 40 meters?]
[14-Aug-2011 22:02:13]  <Loki_Weyland> [They are in Nobody Dies, anyway.]
[14-Aug-2011 22:02:28]  <Lou> [Just be happy we have an actual measure, and not "whatever the animation guys said would fit best in the scene"]
[14-Aug-2011 22:02:44]  <Loki_Weyland> [Right.]
[14-Aug-2011 22:03:07]  <Gendo> "The origins of the Angels are unknown, though I suppose that they can be related to the aliens the Godzilla used to fight...."   He chuckles at this last statement....
[14-Aug-2011 22:03:34]  * Lou frowns again.
[14-Aug-2011 22:03:59]  <Gendo> "What we do know, however, is that normal military efforts cannot injure them, and thus the Evangelions were designed."
[14-Aug-2011 22:04:54]  <Gendo> "You are the pilots of the Evangelions, and are among the elite.  Not anyone can pilot an Evangelion, in fact, only a handful of people in the world are capable.
[14-Aug-2011 22:04:55]  <Gendo> "
[14-Aug-2011 22:05:05]  * Motoko gives the good doctor a very mixed look
[14-Aug-2011 22:05:55]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip glances aside with the last statement.
[14-Aug-2011 22:06:30]  * Loki_Weyland is grinning.
[14-Aug-2011 22:06:47]  <Gendo> "You may be wondering why you have been brought to us now, of all times.  And the answer is simple.  An Angel is coming."
[14-Aug-2011 22:08:00]  <Gendo> "Over the past week, the MAGI have been picking up signs indicative of an Angel, Blue Patterns, as we calle them.  The curious thing is that the signs have been appearing all around the city, faintly, and then disappearing almost as quickly as they show up."
[14-Aug-2011 22:08:15]  <Loki_Weyland> So the Angel's a sneaky prick.
[14-Aug-2011 22:08:42]  <Lou> Lou suddenly speaks up.  "Sir?"
[14-Aug-2011 22:08:54]  <Gendo> "Yes, Lou"?
[14-Aug-2011 22:09:00]  * [Barcode]Osip_Zhgun ('s expression changes to one of determination as the Angel is mentioned.)
[14-Aug-2011 22:10:04]  <Lou> "You haven't explained what the MAGI are.  Isn't Motoko confused enough already?"
[14-Aug-2011 22:10:36]  <Gendo> [MAGI are somewhat common knowledge.  It is known that they are computers, and that they assist the world government in decision making.]
[14-Aug-2011 22:10:50]  <Loki_Weyland> It's HAL.
[14-Aug-2011 22:11:21]  <Lou> [keyboard acting up, gimme a sec...]
[14-Aug-2011 22:11:52]  <Lou> "I don't..." Lou stops, and resumes listening.
[14-Aug-2011 22:12:51]  <Gendo> "Not quite HAL.  The MAGI are three computers with the most developed artificial intelligence in the world.  To simplify: they debate with each other to decide the best course of action.  NERV-HQ houses the Tokyo-3 MAGI, and has been granted use of them for our purposes."
[14-Aug-2011 22:14:17]  <Lou> [Luckily, Inept (Common Lore) ought to extend to not knowing what's common knowledge~]
[14-Aug-2011 22:14:29]  <Gendo> :P
[14-Aug-2011 22:15:18]  <Gendo> "Also, in contrast to HAL, the MAGI are intelligent, yes, but not self-aware.  Something that helps us, as humans, keep them in check."
[14-Aug-2011 22:15:33]  <Gendo> [blah blah blah sci-fi bullshit]
[14-Aug-2011 22:15:53]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [bah, that's no technobabble]
[14-Aug-2011 22:15:54]  <Loki_Weyland> So, no possibility of it going Skynet on us.
[14-Aug-2011 22:16:16]  <Gendo> "Precisely."
[14-Aug-2011 22:16:24]  <Loki_Weyland> Damn. That would've been fun.
[14-Aug-2011 22:16:34]  <Gendo> >:|
[14-Aug-2011 22:16:52]  <Lou> [Technically speaking, each is a restricted Boltzmann machine with initially random inputs, trained over time to match the inferred patterns of classified test subjects...]
[14-Aug-2011 22:18:33]  <Gendo> "But this is getting slightly off topic.  As we know that an Angel is coming, we have time to prepare.  While most of you have been trained from a young age, you are the only Evangelion pilots to have been trained.  We have been reluctant to requisition the remaining pilot candidates, as there has not been an immediate threat, and they have well established, normal lives".
[14-Aug-2011 22:19:54]  <Gendo> "Starting tomorrow, you will all begin training to use the Evangelions."
[14-Aug-2011 22:20:13]  <Gendo> "Tonight is for this basic briefing, to give it time to sink in."
[14-Aug-2011 22:20:19]  <Motoko> Wait...
[14-Aug-2011 22:20:23]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [one question]
[14-Aug-2011 22:20:31]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [actually never mind]
[14-Aug-2011 22:20:32]  <Loki_Weyland> This should be fun.
[14-Aug-2011 22:20:35]  <Motoko> So let me see if I have this right...
[14-Aug-2011 22:20:55]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip raises his hand. "Doctor 
[14-Aug-2011 22:21:01]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [whoops disregard that]
[14-Aug-2011 22:21:07]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [searching for the name right now]
[14-Aug-2011 22:21:16]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [(pressed enter on wrong form)]
[14-Aug-2011 22:21:17]  <Motoko> There are these... alien things coming to attack humanity.
[14-Aug-2011 22:21:25]  <Loki_Weyland> Yep.
[14-Aug-2011 22:21:56]  <Gendo> "Yes, as incredibly fictitious as it seems *cough*, this is indeed the case."
[14-Aug-2011 22:22:30]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [How much training with the TRIDENT have I received, by the way? I'm checking to see whether or not I would have Osip bother asking when he would be involved in team training exercises.]
[14-Aug-2011 22:22:41]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [when the eva pilots would be involved in*]
[14-Aug-2011 22:22:52]  <Motoko> And we only know of one way to attack them, and only a few people in the whole world are capable of... performing this one way of attacking...
[14-Aug-2011 22:23:11]  <Gendo> [You are relatively well trained.  You will participate in the team exercise anyway, to get a feeling for how the group works.]
[14-Aug-2011 22:23:13]  <Loki_Weyland> Now that just sounds suggestive.
[14-Aug-2011 22:23:27]  * Motoko glares at Loki_Weyland 
[14-Aug-2011 22:23:31]  <Loki_Weyland> What?
[14-Aug-2011 22:24:01]  <Lou> [Motoko, could you say "one way of attacking" again?]
[14-Aug-2011 22:24:35]  * Motoko kicks Lou in the trans-fictional shins
[14-Aug-2011 22:24:37]  <Gendo> "Once again, though it may sound like something out of a movie, this is the truth."
[14-Aug-2011 22:25:11]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip too makes a glance of disapproval, before raising his hand. "Doctor Murai," he begins, "Approximately how long will the new pilots need to become familiar with their…machines?" It is clear he has trouble describing them as such. "I am curious as to when we would start team training exercises."
[14-Aug-2011 22:25:29]  <Cassie> 14back
[14-Aug-2011 22:25:38]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [hoo boy, start readin' boy]
[14-Aug-2011 22:25:43]  <Cassie> Already did.
[14-Aug-2011 22:25:53]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [god why am I so repetitive]
[14-Aug-2011 22:26:42]  <Cassie> Cassie raises her hand sharply "Will we be practicing synch tests in the Evangelions themselves or simply using practice entry plugs?
[14-Aug-2011 22:26:47]  <Motoko> Of course, Doctor. I can't pretend that I haven't seen what I've seen over the past hour, but... 
[14-Aug-2011 22:27:02]  <Gendo> "The pilots will begin training three days a week, intensively.  There is no scheduled date for the team training exercises, until the potential of the pilots has been carefully looked over."
[14-Aug-2011 22:27:37]  <Gendo> "The first synch test is scheduled for tomorrow, and we will be using the actual Evangelions."
[14-Aug-2011 22:27:49]  <Loki_Weyland> This should be interesting.
[14-Aug-2011 22:28:06]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> "Understood."
[14-Aug-2011 22:28:53]  <Motoko> You mean these things... not even any simulations...?
[14-Aug-2011 22:29:45]  * Lou 's face goes rigid briefly
[14-Aug-2011 22:29:56]  <Cassie> "You haven't even run simulations for the past few years Pilot Motoko?"
[14-Aug-2011 22:30:30]  <Loki_Weyland> She hadn't even heard of any of this before today. Cut her some slack.
[14-Aug-2011 22:31:19]  <Loki_Weyland> That said, this IS more than fun and games. We'll all need to be in good shape.
[14-Aug-2011 22:31:35]  <Motoko> This can't be safe... or cost-effective... or... sensical...
[14-Aug-2011 22:31:37]  <Gendo> "The synch test is more of a mental training excercise than anything.  To help maneuverability with these behemoths, they will be linked to your own neural impulses, in a process we call synchronization.  It judges how well the neural impulses can translate to the mechanics of the Evangelion."
[14-Aug-2011 22:32:03]  <Cassie> Cassie frowns. "That's criminally irresponsible. She'll be useless the first time she gets hit with feedback from a serious wound."
[14-Aug-2011 22:32:38]  <Gendo> "That's enough from you, Pilot Cassie", Colonel Ishihara snaps.
[14-Aug-2011 22:32:52]  <Gendo> Dr. Murai nods in agreement.
[14-Aug-2011 22:32:55]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip refrains from joining in Cassie's concern.
[14-Aug-2011 22:33:03]  <Loki_Weyland> Motoko: Since they sunk a ton of money into this, this is probably the best solution. Frankly, this worries me a bit.
[14-Aug-2011 22:33:29]  <Lou> Strange problems require strange solutions.
[14-Aug-2011 22:33:34]  <Loki_Weyland> Well said.
[14-Aug-2011 22:33:39]  <Loki_Weyland> Anyway, I guess we'll just have to suck up the pain.
[14-Aug-2011 22:33:45]  <Gendo> "And Motoko, while it may not be cost-effective, may not seem sane, and definitely isn't safe, it is the only hope that mankind has.  The U.N. agrees."
[14-Aug-2011 22:33:46]  <Cassie> "Understood Colonel Ishihara"
[14-Aug-2011 22:34:06]  <Motoko> Um, (woozily) speaking of neural impulses, I have a strong impulse to faint here on the spot. Is that all right?
[14-Aug-2011 22:34:37]  <Gendo> "If that's the case, I can have someone escort you to the infirmary."
[14-Aug-2011 22:34:56]  <Gendo> Dr. Murai hastily motions to one of the techs to lend a shoulder to Makoto.
[14-Aug-2011 22:35:05]  <Motoko> That's... that's wonderful.
[14-Aug-2011 22:35:18]  * Motoko releases strength and slumps to the floor
[14-Aug-2011 22:35:21]  <Motoko> This feels nice...
[14-Aug-2011 22:35:46]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip frowns. "If only we had more TRIDENTs…"
[14-Aug-2011 22:36:08]  <Cassie> 14That's right Motoko, go to your happy place. This is the last time you will see it for a long time.
[14-Aug-2011 22:36:36]  * Motoko 14invokes dark, doomy soundtrack
[14-Aug-2011 22:36:45]  <Gendo> The tech catches and helps Makoto out the door, and begins to carry her to the infirmary.
[14-Aug-2011 22:36:58]  <Motoko> 14Gendo, you have my name flipped around.

[14-Aug-2011 22:39:39]  <Gendo> "Synch tests will be first thing in the morning.  You will be relocated to your residences after that."
[14-Aug-2011 22:39:44]  <Gendo> "Any final questions?"
[14-Aug-2011 22:39:56]  <Loki_Weyland> Are we done?
[14-Aug-2011 22:40:29]  <Cassie> "Will we be provided a way to contact our family members?"
[14-Aug-2011 22:40:59]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip shoots Loki an irritated expression. "Also, where shall I report while the synch tests are performed?"
[14-Aug-2011 22:41:09]  <Gendo> "Yes, you will be provided with NERV issue phones, preloaded with numbers by which you can contact your families, and each other."
[14-Aug-2011 22:41:52]  <Gendo> "Osip, you will be in here in the observatory with me.  It is vital that you have an understanding of the pilots capabilities, as well."
[14-Aug-2011 22:42:08]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> "Understood..."
[14-Aug-2011 22:43:02]  <Lou> [Have I been living in the base, or what?]
[14-Aug-2011 22:43:07]  <Gendo> "If that's all, Colonel Ishihara will take you to your rooms."
[14-Aug-2011 22:43:46]  <Gendo> [Lou:  Yes, you and Osip have been living in base, and know your ways around it fairly well.]
[14-Aug-2011 22:43:53]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [I suppose me and Lou have been here for -yeah.]
[14-Aug-2011 22:44:05]  <Lou> "Will I be assigned aboveground residence, then?"
[14-Aug-2011 22:45:40]  <Gendo> "Yes, you will also be assigned an aboveground residence, Lou, as well as be enrolled in the same school the other pilots will be attending.  It is important that you and your fellow pilots learn how to work around and with each other.
[14-Aug-2011 22:45:42]  <Gendo> "
[14-Aug-2011 22:46:24]  <Loki_Weyland> What about him? *Points to Osip.*
[14-Aug-2011 22:46:28]  <Lou> "Okay."
[14-Aug-2011 22:47:28]  <Gendo> "There are.... Special circumstances for Osip.  He'll be relocated aboveground as well.  We will make certain arrangements for him.  As of now, they are not of your concern."
[14-Aug-2011 22:48:29]  <Gendo> Colonel Ishihara is waiting by the door, tapping her foot impatiently >.>
[14-Aug-2011 22:48:33]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> Osip glances at Loki as he is mentioned, though there is no hostility in his expression this time. He nods at Murai.
[14-Aug-2011 22:48:42]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> "I suppose we should be going, then."
[14-Aug-2011 22:48:46]  * Lou starts walking
[14-Aug-2011 22:49:15]  * [Barcode]Osip_Zhgun leaves as well.
[14-Aug-2011 22:49:20]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> turns to leave*
[14-Aug-2011 22:49:39]  <Gendo> "The rest of you, follow me."

[14-Aug-2011 22:50:20]  *** JBridge <~Joel@c-71-198-84-90.hsd1.ca.comcast.net> has joined #MadokaMadness
[14-Aug-2011 22:50:41]  <Gendo> Colonel Ishihara leads the group out of the room, and down a floor to a set of rooms usually used for visiting scientists and officials.
[14-Aug-2011 22:50:43]  *** JBridge is now known as Loki
[14-Aug-2011 22:50:50]  *** Loki is now known as Loki_Weyland
[14-Aug-2011 22:51:08]  <Loki_Weyland> [What'd I miss?]
[14-Aug-2011 22:51:12]  <Gendo> Needless to say, the rooms are much more adequate than your average hotel.
[14-Aug-2011 22:51:17]  <Lou> [We started walking to our quarters.]
[14-Aug-2011 22:51:23]  <Loki_Weyland> [Ah.]
[14-Aug-2011 22:52:16]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [oh wait, are me and lou leaving to the overground or
[14-Aug-2011 22:52:18]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> ]
[14-Aug-2011 22:52:27]  <Gendo> Each of you have your own room.  On each of your beds is a small package containing a NERV ID, a NERV issue Cellphone, and a copy of the NERV manual.
[14-Aug-2011 22:52:30]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [following everyone else, I suppose?]
[14-Aug-2011 22:52:40]  <Lou> [brb]
[14-Aug-2011 22:53:00]  <Gendo> [You and Lou have your own rooms already, as well as ID, phone, etc.  So I assumed you guys returned to your established rooms...]
[14-Aug-2011 22:53:48]  <[Barcode]Osip_Zhgun> [oh, k. ovrground rez later, then, and for now we go to our normal rooms?]
[14-Aug-2011 22:53:54]  <Gendo> Motoko: When you awake from your faint, you are given a light meal, and escorted to your room, located in the same hall as the others.]
[14-Aug-2011 22:53:59]  <Gendo> [Osip: Yup.
[14-Aug-2011 22:54:01]  <Gendo> ]

[14-Aug-2011 22:55:22]  * Motoko gives a short wave to the assembled pilots
[14-Aug-2011 22:55:32]  <Motoko> Sorry you had to see that.
[14-Aug-2011 22:55:36]  <Gendo> Oh, yeah, there is also a short menu in the rooms, listing cafeteria items available for delivery, as well as a map to the cafeteria.  [For the most part, I'm going to ignore meal time]
[14-Aug-2011 22:56:58]  <Gendo> [bathroom break]
[14-Aug-2011 22:57:38]  <Motoko> 14We should probably wrap this up soon, since some of us have to eat... >_>
[14-Aug-2011 22:57:58]  <Loki_Weyland> I was going to go grocery shopping, myself.
[14-Aug-2011 22:58:20]  <Loki_Weyland> Get some bread to go with dat delicious turkey ham.
