[25-Sep-2011 03:21:42]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> ((Neither of us have logs, do we? @_@ ))
[25-Sep-2011 03:22:21]  <Cassie> It's fine we can recreate the gist of it from memory.
[25-Sep-2011 03:22:46]  <Cassie> Both from first person perspective to give a weird roshamon thing of what the fuck was actually happening
[25-Sep-2011 03:22:50]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (( K, yeah, I think Jac and Cass were picking out knives. ))
[25-Sep-2011 03:24:22]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Oh, how about this one, do you like 'em big? Oh, this one's good for a newbie..."
[25-Sep-2011 03:25:17]  <Cassie> "I'm just picking out a knife at your suggestion Jacqueline. I'll defer to your judgement"
[25-Sep-2011 03:26:50]  <Motoko> Solstace, could you post those links on the wiki page?
[25-Sep-2011 03:26:56]  <Solstace> Sure.
[25-Sep-2011 03:27:40]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "In that case...."
[25-Sep-2011 03:28:11]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel buys more money than possibly can be afforded by a creepy 15-year-old. The shopkeeper is either apathetic or retarded to allow this.
[25-Sep-2011 03:28:38]  <Cassie> [buys money?]
[25-Sep-2011 03:29:59]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (...Knives, herp)
[25-Sep-2011 03:30:02]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (fuck)
[25-Sep-2011 03:31:14]  <Cassie> This is a dilemma for Cassie. One one hand they can't go walking home with this many knives. THey would get arrested. On the other hand Jacqueline already paid for them.
[25-Sep-2011 03:31:32]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "I'll carry them for you, but yeesh, don't be so nervous."
[25-Sep-2011 03:31:43]  <Cassie> Eventually she comes to a conclusion and pays the shopkeeper to ship the knives to their apartment.
[25-Sep-2011 03:32:05]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Eh, I'll have to talk to whoever does our mail in hte morning.
[25-Sep-2011 03:32:07]  <Cassie> Suggests to Jacqueline they ship the knives to the apartment.
[25-Sep-2011 03:32:53]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "They can do that? Like I said, gotta talk to whatever poor bastard at NERV who gets to deliver our mail..."
[25-Sep-2011 03:33:40]  <Cassie> "I don't see why not. Whenever I wanted to buy a new outfit or something I just ordered it through the mail, or called a local shop and asked them to mail it."
[25-Sep-2011 03:36:05]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Right... can't hurt, though I was going to suggest we carry them in case of some thug~."
[25-Sep-2011 03:37:08]  <Cassie> Cassie shakes her head. "No. As pilots we can't afford to get into any unnecessary fights. Besides the Section 2 agents are tailing us." She pauses to wave to the one pretending to pick out a candy bar.
[25-Sep-2011 03:37:38]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "...Clever girl."
[25-Sep-2011 03:38:04]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel grins at Cassie. "Nice work. Let's get the hell out of dodge, shall we?"
[25-Sep-2011 03:39:40]  <Cassie> Cassie nods. "Understood"
[25-Sep-2011 03:41:36]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel grabs Cassie's hand and zips out of the shop before the agents can react.
[25-Sep-2011 03:42:15]  <Cassie> "Why are we running" asks a surprised Cassie "They were fine with escorting us before!"
[25-Sep-2011 03:42:31]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Come on, live a little. You sound kinda like a robot when I ask you something. You sure you don't want to tell Little Ole' Jackie what to do?"
[25-Sep-2011 03:43:33]  <Cassie> "I can imagine that endeavor to be successful on my part Pilot Jacqueline"
[25-Sep-2011 03:43:38]  <Cassie> *can't
[25-Sep-2011 03:46:05]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "You know who can't decide things? Retards, and Lou. Whatever Lou is. And you're neither. Okay, Lou's not a retard, but that's besides my point."
[25-Sep-2011 03:46:22]  <Lou> [that was a weird ping]
[25-Sep-2011 03:46:48]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> (( Unavoidable, though, ))
[25-Sep-2011 03:48:23]  <Cassie> [This is now canon. Due to his hybrid nature, Lou always knows when people are talking about him.]
[25-Sep-2011 03:48:43]  <Lou> [It's his impeccable grasp on the human condition.]
[25-Sep-2011 03:48:47]  <Lou> [Now get back to whatever]
[25-Sep-2011 03:49:06]  <Cassie> [No, he just sneezes, like an anime character]

[25-Sep-2011 03:49:33]  *** LordSparkleLord is now known as Cassie
[25-Sep-2011 03:50:19]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel grabs Cassie in ways that should be sparking off "creeper alert" and would get her arrested if there were any cops around. "Why the silence~?"

[25-Sep-2011 03:56:27]  <Cassie> "No... it's um I don't have much experience shopping with someone my own age. The other candidates never wanted to dress up for formal events, my dad was useless so I got some office lady at NERV to help me."
[25-Sep-2011 03:57:20]  <Cassie> "And then one of them had me start posing as her kid because she read that some guys like to date single moms... and  that whole idea was just generally horrible"
[25-Sep-2011 03:57:48]  <Cassie> Cassie gets the feeling she may have said too much so starts blabbing about other awkward moments instead.
[25-Sep-2011 03:57:57]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "Smart woman."
[25-Sep-2011 03:58:36]  <Cassie> "But yeah, the other candidates always wanted to show up in plugsuits or NERV uniforms for fancy occasions. But those are kinda creepy and boring respectively"
[25-Sep-2011 03:59:21]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> Well, what sorta dress do you want?
[25-Sep-2011 03:59:41]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel grins and moves her face close to Cassie's. "You'd look good in pink~"
[25-Sep-2011 04:00:38]  <Cassie> "No. Pink draws too much attention to you at most events."
[25-Sep-2011 04:01:17]  <Jacqueline_de_Macquerel> "What's wrong with a little attention? You've already got mines~"
[25-Sep-2011 04:03:19]  <Cassie> Nervously Cassie retrats into soldier mentality "In combat attention from the enemy usually makes them attack you. Attention from an ally can alert the enemy to a possible plan."
[25-Sep-2011 04:05:45]  * Jacqueline_de_Macquerel smirks twistedly. "I like the way you think. Or, it could be an intimidation pattern. They'll think you're slim pickings and that they have you figured out, then you punch them in the jaw... or... er, ask them their number."

[25-Sep-2011 04:28:17]  <Cassie> [Jacqueline has basically asked to court Cassie. Cassie is too much of a doormat to say no, so she's fobbing the choice off to somebody else]
