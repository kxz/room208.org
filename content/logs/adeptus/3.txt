[11-Sep-2011 22:38:14]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> unit four, ready
[11-Sep-2011 22:38:15]  <Gendo> GET SET!
[11-Sep-2011 22:38:19]  <Gendo> RET'S GO!
[11-Sep-2011 22:38:19]  <Motoko> 準備できたよ
[11-Sep-2011 22:39:25]  <Gendo> Okay, so, recap:  You guys know Angel is coming soon.  
[11-Sep-2011 22:39:32]  <Gendo> You've been moved into your apartments.
[11-Sep-2011 22:39:37]  <Lou> Yes, the melty one
[11-Sep-2011 22:39:45]  <Gendo> Combat training is today.
[11-Sep-2011 22:39:49]  <Cassie> Spoilers!
[11-Sep-2011 22:39:52]  <Lou> Finally.
[11-Sep-2011 22:39:58]  <Motoko> 何ですって？！
[11-Sep-2011 22:40:06]  <Gendo> Motoko: Don't do that.
[11-Sep-2011 22:40:09]  <Gendo> >:|
[11-Sep-2011 22:40:19]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Combat training is ready? also, I am now retconned into a handler right]
[11-Sep-2011 22:40:24]  <Motoko> Gendo: But we're still in metamode, right? :D
[11-Sep-2011 22:40:26]  <Loki_Weyland> We're recording, I take it?
[11-Sep-2011 22:40:30]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: Yup.
[11-Sep-2011 22:40:34]  <Loki_Weyland> Gotta look good for the chat logs!
[11-Sep-2011 22:40:46]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: ???
[11-Sep-2011 22:40:54]  <Lou> [Brackets are initiated]

[11-Sep-2011 22:41:14]  <Gendo> Oh.
[11-Sep-2011 22:41:15]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [who am I in charge of? Gents, I suppose?]
[11-Sep-2011 22:41:23]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: Yah.

[11-Sep-2011 22:41:46]  <Loki_Weyland> Pidgin does!
[11-Sep-2011 22:41:51]  <JackMackerel> Pidgin sux.
[11-Sep-2011 22:41:52]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [great. so, I got 1 degree of failure on depression today. one sec]
[11-Sep-2011 22:41:55]  <Loki_Weyland> And I'm pretty sure Motoko's recording stuff too.
[11-Sep-2011 22:41:59]  <Motoko> JackMackerel: Language logs? What?
[11-Sep-2011 22:42:00]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I mean continue but]
[11-Sep-2011 22:42:01]  <Loki_Weyland> JackMackerel: It's what works for me.
[11-Sep-2011 22:42:07]  <JackMackerel> I meant packs.
[11-Sep-2011 22:42:10]  <JackMackerel> Shush, you.

[11-Sep-2011 22:42:33]  <Loki_Weyland> Ouch.
[11-Sep-2011 22:42:36]  <Loki_Weyland> Or is that good?
[11-Sep-2011 22:42:39]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [okay. 2 hours of 1 fatigue due to depression. just fyi all~]
[11-Sep-2011 22:42:44]  <Motoko> 14JackMackerel: It's not like you would understand anyway!
[11-Sep-2011 22:42:53]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [it was good. the d5 counts depression hours on top of my failure degrees]
[11-Sep-2011 22:43:02]  <Gendo> So, combat training starts today.
[11-Sep-2011 22:43:16]  <Gendo> You've gone through the daily motions and teasing and what all.
[11-Sep-2011 22:43:27]  <Loki_Weyland> Right.
[11-Sep-2011 22:43:39]  <Gendo> This scene starts in the changing rooms.  You're scheduled to do simulations inside the entry plugs today.
[11-Sep-2011 22:43:41]  <Motoko> 14We're not roleplaying the teasing? But that's the best part!
[11-Sep-2011 22:43:54]  <Gendo> Motoko: [I made allowances, see?]
[11-Sep-2011 22:44:21]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Suppose I'm off somewhere else, then? just requiring coolant vest and all, or are we assuming some plugsuity application is required for the trident too / I mean, well, having to change with kids is a little]
[11-Sep-2011 22:44:43]  <Cassie> [Love knows no age or gender!]
[11-Sep-2011 22:44:55]  <Motoko> 14I forgot how much of my little Jackie/Loki thing was roleplay and how much was out-of-game teasing. It even rhymes, almost!
[11-Sep-2011 22:44:57]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: [I'll leave that up to you.  Did JBridge talk to you about TRIDENT stuff yet?]
[11-Sep-2011 22:45:08]  <Loki_Weyland> No.
[11-Sep-2011 22:45:09]  <JackMackerel> (Motoko: wat)
[11-Sep-2011 22:45:13]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [didn't hear anything. I made a little tech writeup, I mighta told you about it, Loki?]
[11-Sep-2011 22:45:27]  <Loki_Weyland> Specifically, I need to know whether the TRIDENT is next to the EVAs in the Cages.
[11-Sep-2011 22:45:36]  <Loki_Weyland> And yeah, you did tell me about it.
[11-Sep-2011 22:45:52]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: [I figured you're most knowledgeable for that >.>]
[11-Sep-2011 22:45:53]  * JackMackerel spins that damn knife of hers, whistling Twisted Nerve, already dressed and watching the other ladies.
[11-Sep-2011 22:46:01]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [ :3 ]
[11-Sep-2011 22:46:15]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Oh, right. We're in character now.
[11-Sep-2011 22:46:19]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Sorry!
[11-Sep-2011 22:46:19]  <Cassie> "Jaqueline... do you wear your plug suit under your normal clothes?"
[11-Sep-2011 22:46:20]  * Lou is also ready and waiting.
[11-Sep-2011 22:46:30]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Oh, those like padded cell rooms? it seems like it'd do better in a hangar - it doesn't really have to be contained, it's a machine.]
[11-Sep-2011 22:46:33]  * Loki_Weyland is in his plugsuit and ready.
[11-Sep-2011 22:46:45]  * Motoko is already dressed, somehow14, because I don't know what's going on so I thought that would be expedient
[11-Sep-2011 22:46:52]  <Loki_Weyland> Well, as ready as I'll ever be for that torture.
[11-Sep-2011 22:47:05]  <Lou> Is it that bad?
[11-Sep-2011 22:47:18]  <Gendo> [I don't think I'll detail the torture again.  Because I'm kind of lazy right now >.>]
[11-Sep-2011 22:47:32]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Heh.
[11-Sep-2011 22:47:46]  <JackMackerel> "Er... what?"
[11-Sep-2011 22:48:19]  * JackMackerel blinks. "I just finished dressing, or did something happen with your perception of time...?"
[11-Sep-2011 22:48:23]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I don't think even NERV would be okay with me changing with the kids but I guess we could say for ease of RPing I need some sorta plugstylesuit to map my actions to the TRIDENT's. but I also don't need synch tests]
[11-Sep-2011 22:48:35]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [I mean it'sj ust like a public pool changing room right]
[11-Sep-2011 22:48:45]  <Cassie> "Just how you got dressed so fast... sorry pilot Jaqueline, I wasn't paying attention.
[11-Sep-2011 22:48:45]  <Motoko> 14$x^\frac{1}{2}$
[11-Sep-2011 22:48:50]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: [Yeah, pretty much.]
[11-Sep-2011 22:49:16]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [yeah, fuck it then. TRIDENT has a buncha biometric bullshit that plugs into a plugsuitlike apparatus. No mechwarrior-ripping-off neurohelmet-only stuff I guess]
[11-Sep-2011 22:49:33]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Cyberbrains!
[11-Sep-2011 22:49:44]  <Loki_Weyland> "So, we all ready to go?"
[11-Sep-2011 22:49:45]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] quietly changes into his synch-suit. [there because I had to be different]
[11-Sep-2011 22:50:04]  <Cassie> "As ready as Unit-14 will let me be"
[11-Sep-2011 22:50:15]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Waiting on you all."
[11-Sep-2011 22:50:26]  <Loki_Weyland> "I like these things. Feels like I'm wearing a space suit. In some sense, I guess I am."
[11-Sep-2011 22:50:33]  <Motoko> Yes, almost. I feel like I missed the entire morning, you know...?
[11-Sep-2011 22:50:46]  <Loki_Weyland> Not much happened.
[11-Sep-2011 22:50:47]  <JackMackerel> "You can scratch through 'em, too!"
[11-Sep-2011 22:51:16]  <Lou> Ready...
[11-Sep-2011 22:51:16]  <Loki_Weyland> Get up, eat breakfast, go to synch testing. It'll all probably become routine later on.
[11-Sep-2011 22:51:36]  <Gendo> Okay, moving on then!
[11-Sep-2011 22:51:37]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "It shall."
[11-Sep-2011 22:51:44]  <JackMackerel> "Hurry up 'n wait."
[11-Sep-2011 22:51:46]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [yes go ahead]
[11-Sep-2011 22:52:04]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki starts running toward his EVA, mostly out of impatience.
[11-Sep-2011 22:52:20]  <Gendo> So, you all go through the excruciating, and questionably necessary decontamination process again.
[11-Sep-2011 22:52:29]  <Cassie> "You are familiar with procedure zero pilot Jaqueline?" asks Cassie, feebly attempting to make a joke.
[11-Sep-2011 22:52:33]  <Loki_Weyland> $Oh, right. Forgot that bit.
[11-Sep-2011 22:52:57]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [are the evas in a huge hangar then? and are we doing training today? if not I guess I'll just say I had to do some stomping around in the TRIDENT for the day. maintaining skills nad all]
[11-Sep-2011 22:52:58]  <Gendo> And yup, free range to your Evas now.
[11-Sep-2011 22:53:07]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [wheeeeeeee]
[11-Sep-2011 22:53:09]  <JackMackerel> "No, what's that~?"
[11-Sep-2011 22:53:20]  <Cassie> "Hurry up and wait."
[11-Sep-2011 22:53:39]  <Loki_Weyland> "My favorite military saying."
[11-Sep-2011 22:53:52]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] wordlessly walks to his TRIDENT and [do we climb ladders or. whatever, I get in whenever everyone else does :P]
[11-Sep-2011 22:53:58]  * Motoko tries to shake chemical feeling out of hair
[11-Sep-2011 22:54:32]  <Gendo> "Today, we've hooked the Eva's system into a computer simulation, so that you can familiarize yourselves with the feel of synching with an Eva and to get a realistic grasp of the Evangelion's motor functions"
[11-Sep-2011 22:54:33]  * Lou enters his Eva silently
[11-Sep-2011 22:54:40]  <Cassie> Cassie runs over to Unit-14 and scrambles in, waiting for instructions.
[11-Sep-2011 22:55:00]  <Motoko> Oh, I actually get a simulation...? That's a pleasant surprise...
[11-Sep-2011 22:55:03]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: [Yeah, ladders are kind of necessary].
[11-Sep-2011 22:55:18]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [hangar elevators!]
[11-Sep-2011 22:55:19]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki climbs into the eva.
[11-Sep-2011 22:55:22]  <JackMackerel> "Ah..."
[11-Sep-2011 22:55:29]  <Lou> [Ladders are the true power of mankind!]
[11-Sep-2011 22:55:51]  <Motoko> Weren't we on the verge of destruction or something? Or is that... is time dilation involved somehow?
[11-Sep-2011 22:55:55]  * JackMackerel clambers in, avoiding such outmoded things like "ladders" or "not remembering this isn't Assassin's Creed".
[11-Sep-2011 22:56:22]  <Lou> All the more reason to get you trained as soon as possible, right?
[11-Sep-2011 22:56:24]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] begins attaching the various biometric feedback jacks into his suit. He staves off the preliminary startup checks as the machine is to be running in simulation mode.
[11-Sep-2011 22:56:25]  <Gendo> As soon as each of you enters your Eva, and gets seated, the Plugs seal off and fill with LCL.
[11-Sep-2011 22:56:43]  * Motoko 14is forced into Eva by the power of Gendo's narration!
[11-Sep-2011 22:57:00]  <Loki_Weyland> "I don't know if I'll ever get used to the taste of this stuff."
[11-Sep-2011 22:57:20]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] activates the TRIDENT's cockpit computer and [if I've done this simulation thing before, begins entering the information needed to enter simulation mode.]
[11-Sep-2011 22:57:28]  <Cassie> "If you've ever bitten your tongue it's like that. Only everywhere."
[11-Sep-2011 22:57:33]  <JackMackerel> "It smells like... rape."
[11-Sep-2011 22:57:46]  <Motoko> 14Lou: Yeah, maybe, but it doesn't feel any more organized than last time...
[11-Sep-2011 22:57:46]  <Loki_Weyland> "That's a lovely image, Jackie."
[11-Sep-2011 22:57:50]  <Lou> ...
[11-Sep-2011 22:57:57]  <Cassie> "Rape has a smell now?"
[11-Sep-2011 22:58:02]  <Motoko> 14JackMackerel: You're supposed to be ROLE-PLAYING, idiot
[11-Sep-2011 22:58:25]  <JackMackerel> (But it's a direct quote!!! ;~;)
[11-Sep-2011 22:58:30]  <Loki_Weyland> .$ From what?
[11-Sep-2011 22:58:35]  <Lou> Command, can we start the simulation?
[11-Sep-2011 22:58:36]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Mari?
[11-Sep-2011 22:58:44]  <Loki_Weyland> "Yes, let's."
[11-Sep-2011 22:58:45]  <Motoko> 14/kick JackMackerel You're not very good at this!
[11-Sep-2011 22:58:54]  <Lou> [oh shit back in a minute!]
[11-Sep-2011 22:59:07]  <JackMackerel> (The EVA dub, Loki. When Asuka arrives, iirc.)
[11-Sep-2011 22:59:12]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Ah.
[11-Sep-2011 22:59:14]  <Gendo> "Right, Lou, the simulations are loading.  Give it a minute or so.."
[11-Sep-2011 22:59:20]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Apocryphal technobabble: The TRIDENT relies on a rather cumbersome hydrodynamic inertial dampener surrounding the outside of the cockpit pod as opposed to LCL within. Nonetheless the TRIDENT also requires a neurohelmet, which appears to be a bulky, metallic version of this thing: http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0BoO175xieM/SFxciy8-vwI/AAAAAAAADa0/ms7eiutmnD8/s400/IMG_2659.JPG (except without the hammer and sickle ofc)

[11-Sep-2011 22:59:46]  * Motoko watches an incredible amount of indecipherable debugging information fly past on the consoles
[11-Sep-2011 23:00:01]  <Gendo> As Dr. Murai finishes his sentence, the Evnagelion's vision coms online, the plug blackening, as wireframe scenery begins to form.
[11-Sep-2011 23:00:13]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Little does Motoko know that it's just the manual for Photoshop.
[11-Sep-2011 23:00:37]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Before Gendo's post at 4PDT, Osip types in the information necessary to connect to the hangar's simulation network.
[11-Sep-2011 23:00:38]  <Motoko> "Layer blending mask"...?
[11-Sep-2011 23:00:49]  <Cassie> "Is this the same VR system that they used in NERV Toronto Dr. Murai?"
[11-Sep-2011 23:00:50]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [hand controls~]
[11-Sep-2011 23:00:52]  <Gendo> The wireframe eventually fleshes out, and becomes a fairly realistic rendering of Tokyo-3.

[11-Sep-2011 23:02:23]  <Lou> [We raise some chickens.  We have to move the coop occasionally, because they scorchedearth the ground.]

[11-Sep-2011 23:02:28]  <Gendo> "
[11-Sep-2011 23:02:32]  * Motoko looks around the simulated rendering in some awe
[11-Sep-2011 23:02:57]  <Lou> [Btw, about your note, Loki_Weyland, I was thinking of having the symbol be a country flag or something, and having Lou be confused/uncomfortable about it]
[11-Sep-2011 23:02:57]  <Gendo> All of a sudden, the other Evangelions pop into existence.
[11-Sep-2011 23:03:03]  <Motoko> Oh, it's the 14[editors insert a landmark name here later]!
[11-Sep-2011 23:03:07]  <Loki_Weyland> $ That should work.

[11-Sep-2011 23:04:00]  <Cassie> [So Unit-05 is the AMERICA FUCK YEAH EVA?]
[11-Sep-2011 23:04:08]  <Gendo> Yumi's voice comes over the channel "A-alright.  Controls have been connected."
[11-Sep-2011 23:04:39]  <Lou> "Ready."
[11-Sep-2011 23:04:44]  <Cassie> "Understood"
[11-Sep-2011 23:04:45]  * JackMackerel now tries punching a building.
[11-Sep-2011 23:04:47]  <Gendo> "First things first, try to take a step," Says Dr. Murai.
[11-Sep-2011 23:04:51]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: Wait, so, are the controls physical at all?
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:08]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] blinks apathetically at the landscape. "In Russia, we did these tests in real-time." In the simulation, the T-RIDEN-T widens its stance and flexes its arms. "Ready."
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:09]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: Because LOL inexperienced in complex simulations, make an agility check :P
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:12]  <Lou> [There are trigger things.  It's pretty weird.]
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:18]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki taps his fingers on the controls.
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:34]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Woah, I just got around ten posts at once.
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:44]  <JackMackerel> !roll 1d32
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:44]  <GameServ> 22 == 22
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:45]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Don't be surprised if my connection derps out again.
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:47]  * Lou attempts a step.
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:48]  <Motoko> 14I thought, you know, LCL = neural interface medium, so maybe we're just floating in a simulation.
[11-Sep-2011 23:05:55]  <Gendo> Motoko: [My understanding is that there are physical controls, but those act as a rough guideline for what you want to do.  Most of the it is mental, hence, synch scores.]
[11-Sep-2011 23:06:13]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki starts to walk, cautiously.
[11-Sep-2011 23:06:21]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: You want a d100, and get lower than your Agility.
[11-Sep-2011 23:06:22]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: So the primary control mechanism is by mental motion?
[11-Sep-2011 23:06:26]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] easily steps forward, and takes a few more to turn and face the Evas. His time on base and time at home have granted him the understanding that this lesson provides. [you cool with this?]
[11-Sep-2011 23:06:27]  <JackMackerel> (Alright.)

[11-Sep-2011 23:06:36]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [oh god lol]
[11-Sep-2011 23:06:42]  <Loki_Weyland> Gotta keep that Square Cube Law in mind.
[11-Sep-2011 23:06:46]  <JackMackerel> (:<)
[11-Sep-2011 23:06:49]  <Gendo> Oh, also, this is the first time you all have seen the TRIDENT.
[11-Sep-2011 23:07:03]  <Loki_Weyland> What's that thing?
[11-Sep-2011 23:07:06]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [nobody saw me get into it. it was hiding behind the other evas, as it was half the height]
[11-Sep-2011 23:07:09]  <JackMackerel> "Hey. Why can't we have dinosaur mechs~?"
[11-Sep-2011 23:07:21]  <Cassie> Cassie takes a confident step. She's run this drill so many times in NERV Toronto, it's practically automatic.
[11-Sep-2011 23:07:22]  <Lou> [so did I step or what.  I should know what I"m doing, anyhow]
[11-Sep-2011 23:07:28]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki assumes the foreign mech is the target, and looks for how to bring up his weapon.
[11-Sep-2011 23:07:39]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: You attempt to punch the building, and fall facefirst.  Luckily feedback is disabled, but it still makes a very realistic looking dust cloud.
[11-Sep-2011 23:07:48]  <Gendo> Everyone who attempted a step makes it.
[11-Sep-2011 23:07:50]  <JackMackerel> "Goddammit..."
[11-Sep-2011 23:08:02]  <Lou> "I'm glad you're with is, Mr. Zhgun..."
[11-Sep-2011 23:08:03]  <Loki_Weyland> Nice try, Jackie.
[11-Sep-2011 23:08:05]  * JackMackerel gets up, and brushes herself off. Or tries to.
[11-Sep-2011 23:08:08]  * Motoko reaches to touch the nearest visible control panel, falls over in the Eva instead
[11-Sep-2011 23:08:11]  <JackMackerel> "SILENCE~!"
[11-Sep-2011 23:08:13]  <Loki_Weyland> Sadly, you are not Godzilla.
[11-Sep-2011 23:08:15]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: [The TRIDENT is present in the simulation."
[11-Sep-2011 23:08:17]  * Lou glances at JacquerIforgethowtospellthis sadly
[11-Sep-2011 23:08:30]  <Loki_Weyland> Now wazzat thing over there?
[11-Sep-2011 23:08:40]  <Loki_Weyland> And how do I bring up my gun?
[11-Sep-2011 23:09:19]  <Gendo> An unknown male voice comes over the com:  "Loading weapons library now"
[11-Sep-2011 23:09:22]  <Lou> That's the tee riden tee.  It's a mechanical unit that will be assisting us, or fighting instead of us, if we can't get people trained...
[11-Sep-2011 23:09:36]  <Loki_Weyland> Ah.
[11-Sep-2011 23:09:38]  <Motoko> Wait, 14Yumi-chan, I haven't even touched anything yet and... how do I - no, wait a moment, I'm still on the ground! Hey!
[11-Sep-2011 23:09:40]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "I can not help much with this exercise but I'm glad to be here too." Osip's TRIDENT stands still, sweeping the Evas with its chin-mounted gun while its eyes take turns tracking as Lou explains. [I was typing something out here]
[11-Sep-2011 23:09:40]  <Loki_Weyland> So, don't shoot at the Metal Gear.
[11-Sep-2011 23:10:20]  <JackMackerel> "Huh. Yeah, it looks like a REX. I hope it doesn't have to rely too much on that radar dome~"
[11-Sep-2011 23:10:22]  <Cassie> "Which scenario will we be running today?"
[11-Sep-2011 23:10:35]  <Lou> No, it's called a tee riden tee... or a "trident", if you really want...
[11-Sep-2011 23:10:48]  <Loki_Weyland> Yeah, I'll go with TRIDENT.
[11-Sep-2011 23:10:58]  <Gendo> Yumi:  "Motoko, just r-relax, and, um.... Really try to focus.  Your Eva should respond to your mental commands pretty well.  Think about taking a step, and it should do it".
[11-Sep-2011 23:11:02]  <JackMackerel> "You pronounce it Trident, I'm sure~"
[11-Sep-2011 23:11:05]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip adapts the colloquialism. "But yes, this *is* the "Trident". Property of Russia, on loan to NERV as per UN's request."
[11-Sep-2011 23:11:08]  * Motoko 14is clearly the only one having trouble with this "piloting" thing
[11-Sep-2011 23:11:20]  * JackMackerel tries to take a step forward, hopes she doesn't have to roll agility again.
[11-Sep-2011 23:11:38]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Do not feel so bad that you will not get an opportunity to use it - you will find your Evas more than powerful enough."
[11-Sep-2011 23:11:58]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: Mental commands...? You don't mean...
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:05]  <JackMackerel> "I know. This thing fits me like a glove!"
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:09]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] warms up a bit, practicing strafing and short hops.
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:19]  <Gendo> Dr. Murai:  "The Scenario today is nothing too bad.  More of a game, really."
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:23]  * Motoko attempts to stand up, does so rather shakily
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:23]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [not using jumpjets unless the simulation grants me unlimited uses till the scenario starts]
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:25]  <JackMackerel> "I like games~"
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:29]  <Gendo> [Guys, slow down a bit o____o]
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:38]  <JackMackerel> (We should take turns talking...)
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:40]  <Cassie> "Do I at least get to kill something today?"
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:44]  <Motoko> 14I know, right? I'VE FALLEN DOWN AND I ALMOST CAN'T GET UP
[11-Sep-2011 23:12:45]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [jsut trying to keep up with *them*!]
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:15]  <JackMackerel> "I'm with Cass with this~"
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:17]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: You notice that the weapons loaded aren't your standard Pallet Rifles.
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:18]  <JackMackerel> *on this
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:27]  <Loki_Weyland> Hm.
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:35]  <Gendo> They look like something from your childhood.
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:45]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [everyone is holding baby's rattles]
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:46]  <Loki_Weyland> What is this thing?
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:49]  <Loki_Weyland> Wait...
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:49]  <Gendo> Namely, they are ridiculously oversized Laser Tag guns.
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:57]  <Loki_Weyland> ...
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:58]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [guess I'm holding one too]
[11-Sep-2011 23:13:58]  <Lou> ...what are these?
[11-Sep-2011 23:14:03]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [or is my chin gun now a laser tag gun]
[11-Sep-2011 23:14:06]  <Loki_Weyland> These looks stupid.
[11-Sep-2011 23:14:10]  <Cassie> "...Seriously?"
[11-Sep-2011 23:14:17]  <Motoko> Where did these guns come from?
[11-Sep-2011 23:14:27]  *** JackMackerel <~JustAnoth@c-67-169-29-77.hsd1.ca.comcast.net> has left #MadokaMadness

[11-Sep-2011 23:14:36]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: Your simulated weapons have been altered, yes.

[11-Sep-2011 23:14:43]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Before you said they're laser tag guns, I was assuming it was based off our memories. I was going to have Loki's be an M41A Pulse Rifle.
[11-Sep-2011 23:14:47]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [k. I just have the chin gun right now, and the armor plates on my back]
[11-Sep-2011 23:14:50]  <JackMackerel> (What the heck?)
[11-Sep-2011 23:14:55]  <Loki_Weyland> JackMackerel: (16:14:31) Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: [goddamnit]
[11-Sep-2011 23:14:55]  <Loki_Weyland> (16:14:36) Gendo: Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: Your simulated weapons have been altered, yes.
[11-Sep-2011 23:14:55]  <Loki_Weyland> (16:14:40) JackMackerel [~JustAnoth@c-67-169-29-77.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] entered the room.
[11-Sep-2011 23:15:05]  <JackMackerel> (Thanks)
[11-Sep-2011 23:15:16]  <JackMackerel> (Does AEJack have her knives?)
[11-Sep-2011 23:15:18]  <Loki_Weyland> $ OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.
[11-Sep-2011 23:15:22]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [:}]
[11-Sep-2011 23:15:39]  <Gendo> The unknown male voice comes over the coms again "Unfortunately, we don't have enough data to thoroughly model an Angel's combat behaviour."
[11-Sep-2011 23:15:55]  <Loki_Weyland> So, what'll we be fighting?
[11-Sep-2011 23:15:59]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] angles the chin gun up and to the side so it appears in his Trident's field of view. He raises an eyebrow at the chevron-marked laser, but otherwise does not react.
[11-Sep-2011 23:16:05]  <Loki_Weyland> Clay pigeons?
[11-Sep-2011 23:16:11]  <Gendo> Dr. Murai cuts in: "So, we decided that the best experience you can get for dynamic combat is against each other."
[11-Sep-2011 23:16:20]  <Loki_Weyland> Hoo boy.
[11-Sep-2011 23:16:20]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [dohohoho]
[11-Sep-2011 23:16:25]  <Lou> ...
[11-Sep-2011 23:16:25]  <Loki_Weyland> This is going to be interesting.
[11-Sep-2011 23:16:34]  <Motoko> ... this isn't going to end well ...
[11-Sep-2011 23:16:38]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Do I have my naginata as well?
[11-Sep-2011 23:16:39]  <Lou> Do we have teams?
[11-Sep-2011 23:17:02]  <Cassie> "Oooh this will be fun" says Cassie with the first hint of excitement the others have heard in her voice
[11-Sep-2011 23:17:10]  <JackMackerel> "Woo, deathmatch~!"
[11-Sep-2011 23:17:12]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "I suppose AT fields are defenseless against the power of our tagging lasers," Osip dryly remarks.
[11-Sep-2011 23:17:32]  <Gendo> "Yes, you will be grouped into teams."
[11-Sep-2011 23:17:46]  <Loki_Weyland> Who's with who?
[11-Sep-2011 23:17:48]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [^^aaaaaaaand there I go ruining everything again with my robot]
[11-Sep-2011 23:18:01]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: You have your naginata, or at least a polearm resemling it.  It's obviously been modded to fit the game, somehow...
[11-Sep-2011 23:18:09]  <JackMackerel> (What about me >:|)
[11-Sep-2011 23:18:13]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Hm.
[11-Sep-2011 23:18:20]  <Cassie> [So Cassie has her Prog Spear too?]
[11-Sep-2011 23:18:25]  <Gendo> [SLOW DOWN!  PLEASE!  ;_;]
[11-Sep-2011 23:18:37]  <Lou> [Laser tagging naginata!]
[11-Sep-2011 23:18:41]  <Gendo> All Melee weapons are present, and adjusted.
[11-Sep-2011 23:18:43]  <JackMackerel> (Endrance is so cute when he's flustered~)
[11-Sep-2011 23:18:50]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: I'm already slowing down! >_>
[11-Sep-2011 23:19:07]  <Lou> [I'm Rei-ing as hard as I can!!]
[11-Sep-2011 23:19:18]  <JackMackerel> (unf unf)
[11-Sep-2011 23:19:34]  <Gendo> [I'm a little scatter-brained right now and distracted by family, sorry]
[11-Sep-2011 23:19:59]  <Loki_Weyland> $ We'll try to distract you as best we can!
[11-Sep-2011 23:20:29]  <Gendo> [And lets retcon the laser-tag to paintball.  Weapons make more sense that way]
[11-Sep-2011 23:20:34]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Yeah.
[11-Sep-2011 23:20:38]  <Motoko> 14I'm busy moving the logs from the log viewer to static HTML files, since the regular logs will roll off log rotation pretty soon
[11-Sep-2011 23:20:51]  <Loki_Weyland> $Ah.
[11-Sep-2011 23:20:52]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [k. change "yellow chevrons" to "orange-tipped barrel"]
[11-Sep-2011 23:21:05]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [in other words just "k"]
[11-Sep-2011 23:21:19]  <Loki_Weyland> $ NOTE TO SELF: READ THE PLAYER NOTES. IT'S PAINTBALL, NOT LASER TAG.
[11-Sep-2011 23:21:45]  <Gendo> [Also, this probably won't get to be roleplayed out, unless you guys want to put off Angel combat for another session]
[11-Sep-2011 23:21:46]  <Cassie> [So lets say melee weapons look like LARP gear then?]
[11-Sep-2011 23:22:03]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Wiffle bats!
[11-Sep-2011 23:22:05]  <Cassie> [I say Angel this session]
[11-Sep-2011 23:22:16]  <Loki_Weyland> $ I agree.
[11-Sep-2011 23:22:26]  <Gendo> [Alright]
[11-Sep-2011 23:22:42]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [perhaps we can just write up RPing stuff later if we want for the combat]
[11-Sep-2011 23:22:44]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> training*
[11-Sep-2011 23:22:50]  <Loki_Weyland> $Yeah, that's a good idea.
[11-Sep-2011 23:22:57]  <Lou> [Writing out of order works for books, and it works for roleplay too!!]
[11-Sep-2011 23:23:06]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Besides, I want to write this scene.
[11-Sep-2011 23:23:18]  <Gendo> As you guys are playing with your weapons, the simulation suddenly goes black.
[11-Sep-2011 23:23:22]  <JackMackerel> "Goddammit."
[11-Sep-2011 23:23:26]  <Loki_Weyland> ...Shit.
[11-Sep-2011 23:23:35]  <Lou> Sir?
[11-Sep-2011 23:23:47]  <Gendo> Motoko: Pretend we had enough time in the simulation for you to get the basics of movement and stuff down.
[11-Sep-2011 23:23:49]  <JackMackerel> "Oh, wait, no one panic, it's like this every damn first episode, monster suddenly attacks~"
[11-Sep-2011 23:23:49]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] blinks and checks his computer. The computer is still running but the simulation has ended. "Something wrong, Commander?"
[11-Sep-2011 23:23:51]  <Cassie> "I thought they finally got rid of the multiple Evas crashing the system glitch" mutters Cassie
[11-Sep-2011 23:23:59]  <Motoko> 14(having just managed to get back on her feet) What's going on?
[11-Sep-2011 23:24:21]  <Loki_Weyland> Crap. I hate technical errors.
[11-Sep-2011 23:24:33]  <JackMackerel> "Thousand yen says it's a kaiju."
[11-Sep-2011 23:24:33]  <Loki_Weyland> Every LAN party I've been to, something always goes wrong.
[11-Sep-2011 23:24:52]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] pings the server, etc.
[11-Sep-2011 23:24:54]  <Cassie> "Kaiju?"
[11-Sep-2011 23:24:56]  <Gendo> Yumi:  "Ummm, the Magi is detecting an Angel.  A big one".
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:01]  <Motoko> 14JackMackerel: Thousand yen says it's Dr. Murai got distracted by a kaiju movie.
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:02]  <Loki_Weyland> I hope Jackie's not ri- SHIT.
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:17]  <Cassie> "Not a word Pilot Jaqueline. Not a word."
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:18]  <JackMackerel> "You all can pay me later~"
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:26]  <Loki_Weyland> We didn't bet anything!
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:26]  <Lou> The one from before?
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:31]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] rolls for willpower
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:36]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> !roll 1d100
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:36]  <GameServ> 50 == 50
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:41]  <Gendo> Dr. Murai:  "We're getting the Evas prepped for deployment, it'll take a couple minutes"
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:45]  <Loki_Weyland> Great.
[11-Sep-2011 23:25:46]  <Motoko> ... well, at least I got the simulator time I wanted ... but not nearly enough of it ...
[11-Sep-2011 23:26:02]  <Gendo> Even inside the entry plugs, you guys feel the dull rumble of a distant blast.
[11-Sep-2011 23:26:16]  <Gendo> Someone on the com shouts "SHIT!"
[11-Sep-2011 23:26:20]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] immediately starts powering up the Trident. "Commander, what is the fastest way out of this hangar? I am moving to intercept!"
[11-Sep-2011 23:26:21]  <Cassie> "It should be fine pilot Motoko. If all else fails, getting the Eva worked up and pointing it at the target seems to work."
[11-Sep-2011 23:26:28]  <Loki_Weyland> Hey, if anyone dies, I call dibs on their stuff.
[11-Sep-2011 23:27:10]  <Cassie> "What possible use would you have for girls clothes pilot Loki?"
[11-Sep-2011 23:27:10]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> The air vibrates with a mechanical wail as the Trident's reactor turbine spins up to optimal speed.
[11-Sep-2011 23:27:11]  <Motoko> Well, Cassie, if nothing else works out...
[11-Sep-2011 23:27:14]  <Gendo> Colonel Ishihara appears on the link:  "Osip, at the far end of the hangar is an elevator that will take you to the surface.  Use it.".
[11-Sep-2011 23:27:31]  <Loki_Weyland> Nothing conventional, but I'd find a use for 'em.
[11-Sep-2011 23:27:46]  <JackMackerel> "If I die, Loki and Cassie get to keep my knives. Hey, guys, what about the rest of us?!"
[11-Sep-2011 23:27:53]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Motoko Was that supposed to be OOC?
[11-Sep-2011 23:27:58]  <Gendo> [now I need to go find all my charts and stuff]
[11-Sep-2011 23:28:01]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> "Roger that." Osip disengages the leg locks and begins running for the elevator. The entry plugs vibrate slightly with each receding step.
[11-Sep-2011 23:28:12]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [should I roll for agility as I hurry or is that dumb and stupid]
[11-Sep-2011 23:28:23]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: Don't worry about it.
[11-Sep-2011 23:28:25]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [k]
[11-Sep-2011 23:28:42]  <Lou> I don't think this is the time, Mr. Weyland.

[11-Sep-2011 23:39:31]  <Motoko> Pidgin's IRC support is pretty tragicomic, kind of like Irssi's XMPP support actually.

[11-Sep-2011 23:40:31]  <Gendo> Hasn't been formally introduced yet, but I think that "unknown male voice" makes him sound more mysterious than he is.

[11-Sep-2011 23:40:54]  <Gendo> I think it was the VA of some Angel Beats character.

[11-Sep-2011 23:42:14]  <Gendo> Okay.
[11-Sep-2011 23:42:27]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Motoko: You ever considered physio? Or, well…looking up stretches?

[12-Sep-2011 00:48:44]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Wait- my agility's effectively 25. Shouldn't matter much for that roll.

[12-Sep-2011 00:50:36]  <JackMackerel> GameServ, stop being a dickbag.
[12-Sep-2011 00:50:39]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [in that case, 67 − 4 (since my Ag is 40) = 63]

[12-Sep-2011 00:51:08]  <Gendo> A cross shaped blast of energy forms directly under the body of the TRIDENT.

[12-Sep-2011 01:00:12]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: Once again, to do anything to the Angel other than annoy it, you need to activate you spread, which would use up this round.

[12-Sep-2011 01:42:07]  <Lou> [If you do full auto you'll get +20 to your check, and if you succeed by a lot, you can get extra hits.]
[12-Sep-2011 01:42:10]  <Lou> [what?]
[12-Sep-2011 01:42:29]  <Gendo> JackMackerel: No it isn't.
[12-Sep-2011 01:42:39]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Single would imply that you have to put in another round yourself. Thus, it's actually semi-auto.
[12-Sep-2011 01:42:40]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [page 190, 191 for shooting. both are in left column isntead of grouped up]
[12-Sep-2011 01:42:42]  <JackMackerel> (wat :<)
[12-Sep-2011 01:43:06]  <Lou> [Single shot is more like "taking extra time to aim", rather than a mechanical property of the weapon.]
[12-Sep-2011 01:43:17]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Again, an aimed shot.
[12-Sep-2011 01:43:46]  <Motoko> 14Okay, I think I get it now.
[12-Sep-2011 01:44:05]  * Motoko fires a fully automatic burst at the Angel 14whose name I've forgotten already
[12-Sep-2011 01:44:13]  <Gendo> Alright.
[12-Sep-2011 01:44:13]  <Loki_Weyland> $Tsvael, isn't it?
[12-Sep-2011 01:44:23]  <Motoko> 14So that's +20 to BS...
[12-Sep-2011 01:44:24]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [yes]
[12-Sep-2011 01:44:30]  <Gendo> d100, get under your BS+20.  Yup.

[12-Sep-2011 01:44:52]  <Cassie> [Are there any ways to add a bonus to your WS?]
[12-Sep-2011 01:44:52]  <Motoko> 1410 <= 53, four degrees I think
[12-Sep-2011 01:44:53]  <Lou> [so negative ten]
[12-Sep-2011 01:45:00]  <Gendo> And that appears to be... Yeah, 4 degrees of success.
[12-Sep-2011 01:45:09]  <Lou> [no wait, yeah]
[12-Sep-2011 01:45:15]  <Motoko> 14So that's two extra hits.
[12-Sep-2011 01:45:20]  <Gendo> Yup.
[12-Sep-2011 01:45:23]  <Lou> [go motoko.]
[12-Sep-2011 01:45:41]  <Motoko> 14... so, out of three rounds, three hit. Wow, 100% accuracy with an automatic.
[12-Sep-2011 01:45:43]  <Gendo> So three hits at d10.
[12-Sep-2011 01:46:11]  <Gendo> Motoko: I think the idea is that you fired something like 40 shots, and 3 hit.
[12-Sep-2011 01:46:17]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [>_>\
[12-Sep-2011 01:46:19]  <Gendo> But game mechanics and balancing and shit.

[12-Sep-2011 01:46:41]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Wouldn't that break the gun? It is a converted battleship cannon.
[12-Sep-2011 01:46:55]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: Oh, right, do I have to roll for body segments or whatever?
[12-Sep-2011 01:46:57]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [it should be the number of shots in your weapon sheet, which matches up with your ammo but let's continue forget it]

[12-Sep-2011 01:47:33]  <Gendo> Angel takes damage.  Still alive!
[12-Sep-2011 01:47:43]  <Motoko> 14Lou: That's just the ROF stat, right? So we pretend three hits max for a ridiculously inaccurate weapon.
[12-Sep-2011 01:47:45]  <Gendo> Also, pissed.
[12-Sep-2011 01:47:50]  <Lou> [yep!]

[12-Sep-2011 01:47:58]  <Gendo> Now it's your turn.
[12-Sep-2011 01:48:08]  <Lou> Right... what...
[12-Sep-2011 01:48:11]  <Gendo> You're out of range for physical attacks, and can't move back in range this turn.
[12-Sep-2011 01:48:15]  <Motoko> 14Loki_Weyland: That's the Hand Cannon, I believe.
[12-Sep-2011 01:48:20]  <Gendo> YOu can do ranged attacks, though.
[12-Sep-2011 01:48:26]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Maybe. I'll have to read up again.
[12-Sep-2011 01:48:46]  <Lou> [I'll do a full auto burst with my rifle.]

[12-Sep-2011 02:11:55]  <Gendo> Doesn' t need to be long.
[12-Sep-2011 02:12:04]  <Loki_Weyland> Hey, we all fuck up from time to time. Don't dwell on your failure, just think of how you can do better next time.
[12-Sep-2011 02:12:06]  <Gendo> Just log enough to go through collateral, and exp, and all that.
[12-Sep-2011 02:12:12]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Yeah.
[12-Sep-2011 02:12:15]  * Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] forgot to say, he tensed up, then flinched as the splattering happened. But then the whole going limp
[12-Sep-2011 02:12:48]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Maybe we should epilogue next session? lou's not here]
[12-Sep-2011 02:13:27]  * JackMackerel patpats Cassie.
[12-Sep-2011 02:13:30]  <Cassie> "You don't have to deal with the fact that you caused more collateral damage than the actual Angel did."
[12-Sep-2011 02:13:34]  <JackMackerel> Want a drink?
[12-Sep-2011 02:14:01]  <Loki_Weyland> Again, don't dwell on how badly you fucked up. Focus on how you can do better next time.
[12-Sep-2011 02:14:01]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [So collateral is an apartment? Is that it or]
[12-Sep-2011 02:14:20]  * JackMackerel grinned, tilting her head. "I fucked up as well. Couldn't even hit it the second time when it was right under me."
[12-Sep-2011 02:14:28]  <Gendo> Cassie: Actually, the Angel did more collateral than all of you combined.
[12-Sep-2011 02:14:42]  <Gendo> Each time it used the Rising Cross, it did collateral.
[12-Sep-2011 02:14:45]  <Gendo> And it used it a fuckton.
[12-Sep-2011 02:15:07]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [u_u]

[12-Sep-2011 02:15:12]  <Cassie> I thought we got it away from the city for the most part?
[12-Sep-2011 02:15:43]  <Gendo> Cassie: I'm accounting for that.  But there's still some collateral from it.  It also shot off a couple rising crosses in the city before you were deployed.
[12-Sep-2011 02:15:47]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [cassie - yes but it was shooting at us in the city]
[12-Sep-2011 02:15:59]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> Osip is wordless on the radio. The TRIDENT remains limp for a minute, then slowly steers and begins heading towards the hangars again.
[12-Sep-2011 02:16:36]  <Gendo> So, 10 surplus from this battle.
[12-Sep-2011 02:17:07]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [dosh! grab it while you can, lads]
[12-Sep-2011 02:17:10]  <Loki_Weyland> Hey, how long do you think it'll take them to clean the Angel blood off this thing?
[12-Sep-2011 02:17:14]  <JackMackerel> (mawney mawney mawney)
[12-Sep-2011 02:17:27]  <Loki_Weyland> I can't say I pity anyone who has that job.
[12-Sep-2011 02:17:35]  <Gendo> A while.

[12-Sep-2011 02:18:14]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Never mind.
[12-Sep-2011 02:18:41]  <JackMackerel> Cassie: Hey, if ya want, we can go dancin'! Or hit up an arcade or something.
[12-Sep-2011 02:18:47]  <Gendo> Also, 200exp to everyone.  
[12-Sep-2011 02:19:09]  <Motoko> Gendo, did I cause collateral at any point? Technically I'm supposed to take -10 for all tests until the end of the next turn.
[12-Sep-2011 02:19:10]  <JackMackerel> (WOO)
[12-Sep-2011 02:19:22]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [logging on char sheet]
[12-Sep-2011 02:19:24]  <Cassie> "... I don't know how to dance pilot Jaquerel."
[12-Sep-2011 02:19:29]  <Gendo> Motoko:  I don't believe so.  You had really good rolls.
[12-Sep-2011 02:19:31]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [@motoko: nothing to test for atm]
[12-Sep-2011 02:19:48]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Coop stuck a bottle of cheese spread into Megas' core, making a giant cheese monster. One fight later, Megas is covered in cheese. Coop throws some money at some kids running a car washing service.
[12-Sep-2011 02:19:50]  <Motoko> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: I know, but I just want to keep that in mind for future battles.
[12-Sep-2011 02:20:12]  <Gendo> Motoko: Collateral is caused by taking damage, or missing terribly.  You did neither.  
[12-Sep-2011 02:20:14]  <JackMackerel> "S'fine. Lemme teach ya!"
[12-Sep-2011 02:20:23]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Ah.]
[12-Sep-2011 02:20:28]  <Gendo> Everyone caused collateral just from being deployed, but I'm don't think that's what you're asking.
[12-Sep-2011 02:20:30]  * JackMackerel does that weird moe chuckle some anime characters do.
[12-Sep-2011 02:20:41]  <Cassie> [So how do the insanity points affect you? Under 10 is mostly harmless right?]
[12-Sep-2011 02:20:51]  <Motoko> 14Gendo: Oh, lovely. I'm guessing you'll tell me when attacks cause collateral? Since it hits a drawback for me.
[12-Sep-2011 02:21:05]  <Gendo> Motoko: Oh, I'll keep that in mind.
[12-Sep-2011 02:21:08]  <Gendo> This session, you didn't do any.
[12-Sep-2011 02:21:21]  <Motoko> 14Yaaay, no trauma today.
[12-Sep-2011 02:21:23]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Insanity effects come every 10 points. Also, therapy/etc. won't have any immediate (read: in-game-time) effects if you're trying to drop out of your current 10s range for insanity.]
[12-Sep-2011 02:21:57]  <Gendo> Yup, you don't really feel any effects of insanity until.... for a while now.
[12-Sep-2011 02:22:19]  <Gendo> You have to make a Trauma test at 10.
[12-Sep-2011 02:22:22]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [if I was really desperate to maintain my sanity I could go for therapy right now but I have to wonder how many people who are going crazy know such a thing / feel it's therapy-worthy.]
[12-Sep-2011 02:22:41]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [therapy next time-management session*]
[12-Sep-2011 02:22:52]  <Cassie> Depends on introspectiveness and pride I guess.
[12-Sep-2011 02:23:11]  <Gendo> You don't really have any negative effects from insanity until you hit 40 points.
[12-Sep-2011 02:23:20]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Hey, when do we get upgrade points?
[12-Sep-2011 02:23:31]  <Gendo> Loki_Weyland: You buy them with experience, right?
[12-Sep-2011 02:23:37]  <Gendo> I gave you each 200 exp to spend.
[12-Sep-2011 02:23:39]  <Gendo> :/
[12-Sep-2011 02:23:40]  <Loki_Weyland> $ I think so, yeah.
[12-Sep-2011 02:23:54]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [Depends on where our cash goes. also we don't have an OD so gendo decides what nerv spends cash on]
[12-Sep-2011 02:23:57]  <Gendo> I'll even note that on all of your character sheets!
[12-Sep-2011 02:24:04]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [already did~]
[12-Sep-2011 02:24:09]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: I'll let you guys decide together what to buy.
[12-Sep-2011 02:24:21]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [can we call the session officially over? :P]
[12-Sep-2011 02:24:28]  <Lou> And back, just in time for nothing
[12-Sep-2011 02:24:30]  <Gendo> With 10 surplus, you don't can't do much :P
[12-Sep-2011 02:24:32]  <Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]> [OH WAIT]
[12-Sep-2011 02:24:35]  <Gendo> Osip_Zhgun[Barcode]: Yeah, pretty much.
