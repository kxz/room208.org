[24-Sep-2011 19:09:29]  * Motoko tentatively pokes head into the boys' apartment
[24-Sep-2011 19:09:43]  <Motoko> Are you the only one here, Lou...?
[24-Sep-2011 19:10:14]  <Lou> Loki went off to do... something.
[24-Sep-2011 19:10:26]  <Lou> I didn't ask.
[24-Sep-2011 19:10:39]  <Motoko> ...
[24-Sep-2011 19:10:44]  * Motoko turns a little red at the thought
[24-Sep-2011 19:11:23]  <Lou> Eh...
[24-Sep-2011 19:11:37]  <Motoko> I guess it's for the better, right? Not like it'd be very conducive to studying...
[24-Sep-2011 19:11:47]  <Lou> Right.
[24-Sep-2011 19:12:32]  <Motoko> Anyway, I brought my books and everything, so, um, hope you don't mind my coming in...
[24-Sep-2011 19:13:08]  * Motoko steps in tentatively and sets books on the nearest table
[24-Sep-2011 19:13:10]  <Lou> Oh, no.  Thanks for this.  I'd rather not bother you if I could avoid it.
[24-Sep-2011 19:13:32]  <Lou> Anyway, I'm sorry for having to ask basic questions, but I didn't have much time to learn Japanese, so I don't really know many kanji... I didn't realize that they were used this often.  It seems... inefficient.
[24-Sep-2011 19:14:32]  <Motoko> You /are/ a high school student, after all.
[24-Sep-2011 19:14:48]  * Lou looks quizzically at this
[24-Sep-2011 19:14:55]  <Motoko> I don't know how they thought you'd be able to make it with a crash course like this, though.
[24-Sep-2011 19:15:29]  <Motoko> It fits into their philosophy of doing everything as abruptly as possible, at least.
[24-Sep-2011 19:15:58]  <Motoko> Well, let's see what's going on here...
[24-Sep-2011 19:16:06]  <Lou> Ah.  Yes.  This NERV seems fast.
[24-Sep-2011 19:16:08]  * Motoko takes Lou's homework sheet and sits at the table
[24-Sep-2011 19:19:04]  <Motoko> "1. What were the major structural effects of the... the... ugh, Emergency Governmental Powers Re-estab... lishment Act of 2001?"
[24-Sep-2011 19:19:24]  <Motoko> No wonder you couldn't read this...
[24-Sep-2011 19:19:37]  <Lou> I've never heard of that...
[24-Sep-2011 19:19:40]  <Motoko> And the question is so vague!
[24-Sep-2011 19:20:16]  <Lou> So you didn't learn this at your former schooling?
[24-Sep-2011 19:20:16]  * Motoko sighs
[24-Sep-2011 19:21:13]  <Motoko> I /did/, but who has time to remember all of that?!
[24-Sep-2011 19:21:16]  *** Jack|Cooking is now known as Jack|BRB
[24-Sep-2011 19:21:20]  *** Jack|BRB <~JustAnoth@75-51-144-130.lightspeed.sntcca.sbcglobal.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[24-Sep-2011 19:21:49]  <Lou> If we can't learn these things, why do they have us learn them?
[24-Sep-2011 19:22:16]  <Motoko> Huh?
[24-Sep-2011 19:22:18]  <Barcode> [[people learn when they are taught]]
[24-Sep-2011 19:22:30]  <Motoko> Wait, I didn't mean that literally...
[24-Sep-2011 19:22:35]  <Lou> Oh.
[24-Sep-2011 19:23:32]  <Motoko> Anyway, the Re-establishment Act was passed after the asteroid strike.
[24-Sep-2011 19:23:34]  <Lou> The government is what controls people.  If their powers had to be re-established, they must have been lost.  Right?
[24-Sep-2011 19:23:58]  <Lou> Wait, is it "their" or "its" or some other pronoun.
[24-Sep-2011 19:24:36]  <Motoko> That's not really all /that/ important...
[24-Sep-2011 19:25:06]  <Motoko> If you're having trouble with it, just don't bother with it in the first place.
[24-Sep-2011 19:25:17]  <Lou> Don't bother with pronouns?
[24-Sep-2011 19:25:59]  <Lou> I don't want to speak ambiguously.  Ambiguity causes misunderstanding causes violence.
[24-Sep-2011 19:26:02]  <Motoko> No, that's not what I... aagh, just go with your instinct!
[24-Sep-2011 19:26:19]  <Lou> Sorry.  Okay.
[24-Sep-2011 19:26:39]  <Lou> An asteroid strike, you said?  In 2001?
[24-Sep-2011 19:26:49]  <Motoko> Or drag Mr. Ishii around and ask him every time you - I mean, never mind that. Don't actually do that, okay?
[24-Sep-2011 19:27:30]  <Lou> I know that, people don't like being dragged around, and I don't like grabbing people.
[24-Sep-2011 19:27:37]  <Motoko> Right, where was I... it was in 2000, wasn't it? You have to know that much, at least.
[24-Sep-2011 19:28:36]  <Motoko> But most of the national government structure was wiped out, so it took a long time to stabilize.
[24-Sep-2011 19:29:00]  <Lou> Right.  2000.  Right.  And that destroyed the government.  So the remains acted.  They must have restructured to not be so damaged in the case of more asteroids.
[24-Sep-2011 19:29:31]  <Motoko> Well, I don't think more asteroids were really on their mind at that point...
[24-Sep-2011 19:30:00]  <Motoko> I mean, I think they were more concerned with having something that functioned at all.
[24-Sep-2011 19:30:49]  <Lou> Then the major structural effects would be an overall decrease in the structural elegance of the government.
[24-Sep-2011 19:30:57]  * Lou uses several English words in the last sentence, not knowing the Japanese
[24-Sep-2011 19:32:45]  <Motoko> "Structural elegance"...? Sorry, I don't realy follow...
[24-Sep-2011 19:33:32]  <Motoko> 14English? Oh, right, American moonbase, right, right.
[24-Sep-2011 19:34:28]  <Lou> Well, you implied that they prioritized quickly restarting government action over forming a system that was overall well made.
[24-Sep-2011 19:34:37]  <Lou> [heh, he totally speaks French]
[24-Sep-2011 19:35:47]  <Motoko> I don't think it was /bad/, but they didn't have time to get everything down perfectly...
[24-Sep-2011 19:36:19]  <Motoko> This was before the Valentine's Day treaty was signed, after all. So there was still war...
[24-Sep-2011 19:37:05]  <Motoko> Seems so strange, doesn't it? That we were born in the middle of global conflict, and now here we are going to high school just like nothing happened.
[24-Sep-2011 19:37:44]  <Lou> People don't like things to be abnormal.  They snap back as soon as they can.
[24-Sep-2011 19:38:12]  * Lou starts writing "Overall quickly poorly designed structure" in hiragana
[24-Sep-2011 19:38:14]  <Motoko> Yeah...
[24-Sep-2011 19:38:21]  * Motoko stares out the window at the fake underground sky

[24-Sep-2011 19:45:18]  <Lou> I was in an American base.  I got here a few months ago.

[24-Sep-2011 19:57:19]  <Motoko> My mother called me, saying that Satsuki was wondering why I hadn't been to school for the past couple of days, and that she was bound not to tell her anything about where I am...
[24-Sep-2011 19:57:51]  <Lou> They can't just say that the government needs you to be elsewhere?

[24-Sep-2011 20:11:09]  <Lou> Oh.  Yes.  Right.
[24-Sep-2011 20:12:03]  <Motoko> That's the little eye picture at the beginning of television shows, right?

[24-Sep-2011 20:12:46]  <Lou> They don't seem to have done a great job.  Unless Cassie's commercial was intentional.
[24-Sep-2011 20:13:27]  <Motoko> Well, nobody's perfect...
[24-Sep-2011 20:16:13]  <Motoko> I think they also nationalized the major media outlets?

[24-Sep-2011 20:25:07]  <Lou> I don't know.  It doesn't really matter.  I'll just find a good two language dictionary somewhere.

[24-Sep-2011 20:54:52]  <Lou> Yeah, bye- urk
[24-Sep-2011 20:55:15]  * Motoko 14is entering observer mode
[24-Sep-2011 20:55:28]  <JBridge> "Oh, right. Homework. Never much cared for the stuff."
[24-Sep-2011 20:55:36]  <Lou> Uh.  Yes.  Recent events, I think is the term.

[24-Sep-2011 20:56:20]  <JBridge> "Fuck it. Might as well get it over with."
[24-Sep-2011 20:56:28]  <Lou> It's just three questions.
[24-Sep-2011 20:57:15]  <JBridge> "is it? Well, that's good. Hopefully."
[24-Sep-2011 20:57:34]  <JBridge> "Let's see... crap."
[24-Sep-2011 20:58:14]  <JBridge> "I know nothing about this. I don't know much about American politics, let alone Japanese."
[24-Sep-2011 20:58:27]  <Lou> Well, neither do I, but apparently it's okay to make things up.
[24-Sep-2011 20:58:42]  <JBridge> "Only if it sounds like you know the answer."
[24-Sep-2011 20:58:50]  <Barcode> [@Alkthash: Well, you are/were with Jacqueline, weren't you? then again so was loki, someone will ahve to untangle the canon for me]
[24-Sep-2011 20:58:55]  <JBridge> "Not to mention that I can't read half these kanji."
[24-Sep-2011 20:59:30]  <Lou> It's pretty easy to sound as if you're well-educated, or it would be if I could write, anyway.
[24-Sep-2011 20:59:39]  <Motoko> 14What is it with all of you and kanji? :|
[24-Sep-2011 20:59:44]  <Alkthash> [As far as I can tell Jacqueline dragged Cassie out the night before school]
[24-Sep-2011 20:59:50]  <Barcode> [Oh.]
[24-Sep-2011 21:00:18]  <Lou> [motoko: I thought they were the hard part of Japanese to learn.]
[24-Sep-2011 21:00:20]  <JBridge> $ Loki's a weeaboo. He's known a couple random kanji for a good while, but didn't take up Japanese study until recently.
[24-Sep-2011 21:02:43]  <Barcode> [is the ツ in ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ kanji?]
[24-Sep-2011 21:02:49]  <Lou> [no]
[24-Sep-2011 21:02:56]  <Barcode> [I was gonna say, it's korean isn't it]
[24-Sep-2011 21:03:02]  <Barcode> [or wrong again?]
[24-Sep-2011 21:03:02]  <Lou> [no]
[24-Sep-2011 21:04:04]  <Lou> [it's katakana, shi]

[24-Sep-2011 21:04:12]  <Lou> [or not]
[24-Sep-2011 21:04:15]  <Barcode> [thx]
[24-Sep-2011 21:04:31]  <Lou> [oh, the angle's different...]
[24-Sep-2011 21:04:31]  <Barcode> [are kana different from kanji]
[24-Sep-2011 21:04:34]  <Motoko> 14"shi" looks similar シ but the two dots are stacked above each other and the long stroke goes in the other direction.
[24-Sep-2011 21:04:42]  <Barcode> [katakana*]
[24-Sep-2011 21:05:04]  <Lou> [Kana (meaning katakana and hiragana) are syllabrys (sp), where kanji are logogrammatic]
[24-Sep-2011 21:05:09]  <Motoko> 14hira- and katakana are syllabaries. kanji is an ideographic system, like Chinese characters.
[24-Sep-2011 21:05:15]  <Barcode> [¯\_(シ)_/¯ ]
[24-Sep-2011 21:05:17]  <Lou> [logographic]
[24-Sep-2011 21:06:13]  <JBridge> $ Lolographic?
[24-Sep-2011 21:06:44]  <Barcode> [legographic]
[24-Sep-2011 21:07:00]  <Motoko> 14Lou, I'm lazy and conflate words all the time.
[24-Sep-2011 21:07:15]  <Lou> [I was just correcting my spelling, I keep thinking it's "logogrammatic"]
[24-Sep-2011 21:08:28]  <JBridge> $Right. Where were we?
[24-Sep-2011 21:08:41]  <Barcode> [You walked in, looked at lou's homework which is also your homework]
[24-Sep-2011 21:08:49]  <Barcode> [motoko left just about when you came in]
[24-Sep-2011 21:09:32]  <JBridge> "Hrm."
[24-Sep-2011 21:09:33]  <Barcode> [miss mackerel is nowhere to be found, I'm presumably asleep and/or sitting around trying to reconcile the freakout I had a few days(?) earlier]
[24-Sep-2011 21:09:55]  <Barcode> [well i also have my own apartment at this point so]
[24-Sep-2011 21:10:01]  <JBridge> "I can't just copy you- they'd notice that."
[24-Sep-2011 21:10:14]  <Lou> My writing is distinctively bad, I'm sure.
[24-Sep-2011 21:10:26]  <JBridge> "Likewise."
[24-Sep-2011 21:11:25]  <JBridge> "The internet shall be my guide. A good search engine and machine translator will have to do."
[24-Sep-2011 21:12:02]  <Lou> Well, good luck.
[24-Sep-2011 21:12:08]  <Lou> If you can read the book, that might help...
[24-Sep-2011 21:15:30]  <JBridge> Around half an hour later, Loki is finally done. Around half of that time was spent getting the grammar right.
[24-Sep-2011 21:16:14]  <JBridge> "God damn, I feel like an idiot after that."
[24-Sep-2011 21:16:14]  * Lou switched to writing in a personal notebook.
[24-Sep-2011 21:16:27]  <JBridge> $ In Lunatic, I take it.
[24-Sep-2011 21:16:54]  <Lou> [but of course]
[24-Sep-2011 21:17:12]  <Motoko> 14JBridge: "romuluSngan Hol yIjatlh. He'So' QIchlIj."
[24-Sep-2011 21:19:46]  <JBridge> $ Hm. I'm not sure where things go from here.
[24-Sep-2011 21:19:54]  <JBridge> $ This would be a bad place to end, though.
[24-Sep-2011 21:20:08]  <Lou> [Anyway, bam, anarchic session basically done and without sex jokes.  Take /that/, traditional notions of authoritarian RPing necessity!]
[24-Sep-2011 21:20:17]  <Lou> [JBridge: Ninja with shotgun, or Alkthash]
[24-Sep-2011 21:21:05]  <JBridge> $ Cassie has no reason to walk in, though. Maybe she needs help with homework as well?
[24-Sep-2011 21:21:35]  <Motoko> 14Cassie runs in to report that Jackie's set her hair on fire.
[24-Sep-2011 21:21:38]  <Lou> [she doesn't like homework. you could elaborate on your injury]
[24-Sep-2011 21:21:48]  <JBridge> Oh yeah.
[24-Sep-2011 21:22:03]  <JBridge> $ I don't have any idea what it might've been, though.
[24-Sep-2011 21:23:12]  <Motoko> 14<Cassie> Oh my God, I didn't know Pilot Jacqueline hated hair dye that much!
[24-Sep-2011 21:23:16]  <Lou> [Imaaaaaagination]
[24-Sep-2011 21:23:23]  <Lou> [I'm liking this fire idea]
[24-Sep-2011 21:23:42]  <JBridge> $ Loki would be the type to play with explosives.
[24-Sep-2011 21:23:50]  <Lou> [Or you could just end with Loki staring at Lou]
[24-Sep-2011 21:24:30]  <JBridge> "So Lou, what's your history?"
[24-Sep-2011 21:25:03]  <Motoko> 14All right, I'm out for now. I'll put logs up later.
[24-Sep-2011 21:25:18]  <JBridge> $ Danke.
[24-Sep-2011 21:25:59]  <Lou> Uh, the same as yours?  What were the effects of the 2001 government restarting act, and the 2003 audio blinding act, and the Hakone...
[24-Sep-2011 21:26:46]  <JBridge> "No, I meant you. What was your life like? What are your parents like? What kind of friends did you have before you moved here? That kind of thing."
[24-Sep-2011 21:27:27]  <Lou> Why?
[24-Sep-2011 21:27:49]  <JBridge> "I'd like to know more about my coworkers."
[24-Sep-2011 21:28:48]  * Lou says warily, "I lived in an American base.  Probably like Cassie.  Most of the details are classified."
[24-Sep-2011 21:29:29]  <JBridge> "OK. What were the people there like? Do you have any friends there?"
[24-Sep-2011 21:30:49]  <JBridge> "Family?"
[24-Sep-2011 21:31:04]  <Lou> ...I suppose they were the same as anybody anywhere, and I had a few friends.
[24-Sep-2011 21:31:24]  <JBridge> "Tell me about them, then."
[24-Sep-2011 21:33:06]  * Lou sits back a bit
[24-Sep-2011 21:33:54]  <Lou> I think I knew somebody like you, now that I think about it.  He wasn't rich, but he generally leaped into things quickly like you do.
[24-Sep-2011 21:34:20]  <JBridge> "Oh?"
[24-Sep-2011 21:35:08]  <Lou> Yeah, he died... in training, I mean.  So you probably shouldn't act too much like him.
[24-Sep-2011 21:35:18]  <JBridge> "...Ah."
[24-Sep-2011 21:35:56]  <JBridge> Loki's expression becomes something decidedly unlike a grin.
[24-Sep-2011 21:36:01]  <Alkthash> [We can have the Cassie needs help with homework thing, but that seems played out. I have another idea, if you guys will indulge it]
[24-Sep-2011 21:36:07]  <Lou> [what?]
[24-Sep-2011 21:36:12]  <Lou> [I was just going to end it]
[24-Sep-2011 21:36:42]  <Alkthash> [Oh nvm. Cassie being herself wanted to invite the other pilots to synch training]
[24-Sep-2011 21:36:51]  <Lou> [right-o]
[24-Sep-2011 21:37:09]  <Barcode> [Isn't synch-training just a weekly occurrance set up by nerv?]
[24-Sep-2011 21:37:11]  <Lou> Unpredictability is the Angels' nature.  Just don't get overconfident, and I'm sure you'll be fine...
[24-Sep-2011 21:37:18]  <Lou> I'm going to go get the lay of the land.
[24-Sep-2011 21:37:29]  <JBridge> "Taking a walk?"
[24-Sep-2011 21:37:37]  <Lou> Yeah.
[24-Sep-2011 21:37:37]  <Lou> /me puts his notebook in a desk and walks out
[24-Sep-2011 21:37:52]  <JBridge> "See ya."
