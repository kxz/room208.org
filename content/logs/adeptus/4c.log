Where I have come from there was little interest and fewer opponents." Having peeled the tape, he slings one arm under the box to prevent it from falling, and slides the top half of the case over. The hinge prevents it from flying off onto the floor. [another message incoming]

The entire package appears to be fairly cheap. A three-panel, paper beginner's manual sits under the two bags. "In that case, would you be interested in a game?
