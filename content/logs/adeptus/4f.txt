[25-Jan-2012 06:19:25]  <Lou> I don't even need security clearance to see that you're underage?
[25-Jan-2012 06:21:12]  <Motoko> What difference does it make to you, Lou? You're just as underage.
[25-Jan-2012 06:22:37]  <Lou> I meant "I" as "anyone".
[25-Jan-2012 06:24:18]  <Motoko> It's all just archival data now anyway.
[25-Jan-2012 06:24:33]  <Motoko> That world is over.
[25-Jan-2012 06:24:52]  <Lou> Onto the next.
[25-Jan-2012 06:25:07]  <Lou> It didn't hurt this time.  That's good.  And you're still here, even.
[25-Jan-2012 06:28:21]  <Motoko> I'm surprised you made it as well.
[25-Jan-2012 06:29:19]  <Motoko> I should be thankful I can share my burdens with someone else who has no universe to call home.
[25-Jan-2012 06:29:38]  <Lou> Oh, you haven't gone through this before?
[25-Jan-2012 06:31:18]  <Motoko> No.
[25-Jan-2012 06:31:24]  <Motoko> And I'd rather not do it again.
[25-Jan-2012 06:33:15]  <Lou> How strange.  I wonder what you are, then.
[25-Jan-2012 06:34:36]  <Motoko> What do you mean?
[25-Jan-2012 06:36:02]  <Lou> Well.  Nothing else major has reappeared before.  Certainly nothing alive.  And this void is new as well.  Maybe they erase my memory.
[25-Jan-2012 06:39:03]  <Motoko> Do you think this makes me... different, somehow?
[25-Jan-2012 06:39:12]  <Lou> Probably.
[25-Jan-2012 06:39:28]  <Motoko> I don't know. I'm even less aware of what's happening to me than you are.
[25-Jan-2012 06:39:37]  <Lou> I'd wondered that anyway.
[25-Jan-2012 06:42:10]  <Motoko> How much I knew?
[25-Jan-2012 06:42:32]  <Lou> If you were different.
[25-Jan-2012 06:43:34]  <Motoko> Hm. I guess it was a stupid question. Of course I'm different.
[25-Jan-2012 06:43:48]  <Motoko> Everyone else is gone, but I'm still here, and you're still here, wherever "here" is.
[25-Jan-2012 06:44:04]  <Motoko> So that makes us different. In that kind of superficial sense.
[25-Jan-2012 06:44:18]  <Lou> They could be in some other "here".
[25-Jan-2012 06:44:50]  <Motoko> But it's not ours, is it?
[25-Jan-2012 06:45:38]  <Lou> "ours", huh.  Well, no.
[25-Jan-2012 06:46:52]  <Motoko> Yeah. Just us.
[25-Jan-2012 06:47:24]  * Motoko bites her lip, looking down at her feet
[25-Jan-2012 06:48:49]  <Lou> Something wrong?  Other than being mostly alone in a void.
[25-Jan-2012 06:49:39]  <Motoko> Mostly just that.
[25-Jan-2012 06:50:18]  <Motoko> And, well, the things that come from being mostly alone, instead of just alone.
[25-Jan-2012 06:51:47]  * Lou smirks.  "Yes, that's new for me as well."
[25-Jan-2012 06:52:00]  <Lou> I wouldn't worry.  They can't have much use in doing this for long.
[25-Jan-2012 06:52:32]  <Motoko> But what if it's not them?
[25-Jan-2012 06:52:38]  <Motoko> What if this just *is*? What then?
[25-Jan-2012 06:53:47]  * Lou stares, then looks away
[25-Jan-2012 06:53:53]  <Lou> That wouldn't explain everything before.
[25-Jan-2012 06:54:34]  <Motoko> I've learned that some things just don't have an explanation.
[25-Jan-2012 06:55:08]  <Lou> Maybe not yet.
[25-Jan-2012 06:55:53]  <Motoko> No, not even then.
[25-Jan-2012 06:56:17]  <Lou> You haven't waited long enough.
[25-Jan-2012 06:56:25]  <Motoko> We try to come up with stories after the fact to make things make sense to us, but in the end, sometimes, events are just random.
[25-Jan-2012 06:57:51]  <Motoko> I should know. What happened to Tomoko was like that.
[25-Jan-2012 06:59:00]  <Lou> Things don't just happen.  People make things happen.
[25-Jan-2012 06:59:46]  <Motoko> Not the things that happened to her.
[25-Jan-2012 06:59:57]  <Motoko> Nobody could have just done that.
[25-Jan-2012 07:01:27]  <Lou> They can do anything.
[25-Jan-2012 07:01:30]  <Lou> What is Tomoko.
[25-Jan-2012 07:04:22]  <Motoko> I guess I should explain...
[25-Jan-2012 07:04:31]  * Motoko takes an uneven breath
[25-Jan-2012 07:09:11]  <Motoko> I don't think I've talked much about my family since... well, you know.
[25-Jan-2012 07:09:23]  <Lou> I don't.
[25-Jan-2012 07:09:45]  <Motoko> Ever, really.
[25-Jan-2012 07:09:59]  <Motoko> At least not with you.
[25-Jan-2012 07:10:03]  <Lou> You made up that story about your grandmother.
[25-Jan-2012 07:10:31]  <Motoko> I did, yeah.
[25-Jan-2012 07:11:51]  <Motoko> My grandmother just lives out in the country. The one that's still alive. On my mom's side.
[25-Jan-2012 07:12:12]  <Motoko> But that's another story. For some other time.
[25-Jan-2012 07:12:43]  <Motoko> What I meant is that I'm an only child.
[25-Jan-2012 07:13:00]  <Motoko> No brothers, no sisters.
[25-Jan-2012 07:13:24]  <Lou> Okay.
[25-Jan-2012 07:14:04]  <Motoko> But I almost had one. A sister.
[25-Jan-2012 07:14:33]  <Lou> Thus the anagram.
[25-Jan-2012 07:14:47]  <Motoko> Right. She never got a real name. It's just what I called her.
[25-Jan-2012 07:15:00]  <Lou> 14Motoko confirmed for alternate universe PKD
[25-Jan-2012 07:15:01]  <Motoko> She was... my twin. Literally my twin.
[25-Jan-2012 07:16:55]  <Motoko> But... I think it was four or five months into the pregnancy. Something went wrong.
[25-Jan-2012 07:18:20]  <Motoko> I think they call it a vanishing twin. She died, and just... disappeared.
[25-Jan-2012 07:19:19]  <Motoko> The medical explanation is that the fetus gets reabsorbed by the surviving twin. Something like that.
[25-Jan-2012 07:21:39]  <Motoko> My mother told me this when I was eleven. I don't remember why. She was -- distraught.
[25-Jan-2012 07:23:37]  <Motoko> Ever since then, I occasionally see her in my dreams, the sister I never had. She'll comfort me and tell me everything is all right but behind it all I can feel this... jealousy, this hatred, this resentment, like she wants to take my place and give me hers.
[25-Jan-2012 07:24:29]  <Motoko> And I ask myself if she's really wrong to feel that way.
[25-Jan-2012 07:25:24]  <Motoko> So... that's my story.
[25-Jan-2012 07:26:24]  <Lou> Are you thinking that she's taken your place?
[25-Jan-2012 07:27:09]  <Motoko> I didn't even think about it that way.
[25-Jan-2012 07:27:45]  <Motoko> It was just... what happened to Tomoko pretty much embodied randomness for me.
[25-Jan-2012 07:28:11]  <Motoko> There's no explanation beyond her being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[25-Jan-2012 07:28:37]  <Lou> They wanted you to have someone in your dreams.  I don't know.
[25-Jan-2012 07:28:53]  <Motoko> You think they have all this power?
[25-Jan-2012 07:29:06]  <Motoko> Well, maybe. It might be easier to swallow.
[25-Jan-2012 07:30:28]  <Motoko> Sorry if I depressed you or anything. It's not the most uplifting story, I know.
[25-Jan-2012 07:31:37]  <Motoko> But, you know, movies always taught me that when two people are trapped someplace together, they either share their stories, or one of them confesses to the other.
[25-Jan-2012 07:32:03]  <Motoko> And I'm not really gunning for the latter. No offense.
[25-Jan-2012 07:32:18]  <Lou> None taken.
[25-Jan-2012 07:32:59]  <Lou> I already think they have enough control to kill your sister in the womb just to make you feel things.  It's hardly going to depress me.
[25-Jan-2012 07:33:56]  * Motoko nods
[25-Jan-2012 07:34:46]  <Motoko> If they did, it worked.
[25-Jan-2012 07:35:01]  <Motoko> It worked really well.
[25-Jan-2012 07:36:22]  <Lou> They made me me, and you you, for whatever reasons... and stories, huh.  What kind of story can I share.
[25-Jan-2012 07:36:57]  <Lou> What do you think of this thought of mine?  It's not normal.
[25-Jan-2012 07:37:34]  <Motoko> Which one?
[25-Jan-2012 07:37:45]  <Lou> Then.
[25-Jan-2012 07:37:47]  <Lou> *Them.
[25-Jan-2012 07:38:19]  <Motoko> I don't really know.
[25-Jan-2012 07:39:00]  <Motoko> Some people believe in a God that works like they do to you.
[25-Jan-2012 07:39:25]  <Motoko> He plans everything, and it all happens for a certain reason.
[25-Jan-2012 07:40:31]  <Motoko> It's just not a reason that we can comprehend.
[25-Jan-2012 07:40:53]  <Lou> God is supposed to be nice.
[25-Jan-2012 07:41:11]  <Motoko> There's a saying I think you know. "God works in mysterious ways."
[25-Jan-2012 07:42:12]  <Lou> I thought they put that in to mock me.
[25-Jan-2012 07:42:29]  <Motoko> Maybe they're working for some good none of us understand.
[25-Jan-2012 07:42:44]  <Motoko> It's all beyond me. So I call it random.
[25-Jan-2012 07:44:39]  <Lou> Sometimes it makes sense.  Sometimes it doesn't.  I've tried to understand.
[25-Jan-2012 07:44:43]  <Lou> Oh.  I know a story.
[25-Jan-2012 07:44:55]  <Lou> One time they just left me alone.
[25-Jan-2012 07:45:32]  <Motoko> I hope that's not the whole story.
[25-Jan-2012 07:45:36]  * Motoko giggles
[25-Jan-2012 07:45:41]  <Lou> Very funny.
[25-Jan-2012 07:45:59]  <Motoko> Sorry. I couldn't resist.
[25-Jan-2012 07:46:15]  <Lou> There was a base.  Empty of people, like it had been abandoned for months.  Locked exits, but enough supplies to let me live indefinitely.
[25-Jan-2012 07:46:22]  <Lou> I guess we could use humor about now.
[25-Jan-2012 07:47:23]  <Lou> Everything was all prepped to go, though.  So I went, because that's what they always want me to do.  Us.
[25-Jan-2012 07:47:37]  <Motoko> Us?
[25-Jan-2012 07:48:00]  <Lou> I usually think of pilots as being just me, but you're new.
[25-Jan-2012 07:48:27]  <Motoko> So us. People who are told to go, and who go.
[25-Jan-2012 07:48:46]  <Lou> They didn't even have to tell me directly.  I guess they were just making sure I was trained.
[25-Jan-2012 07:50:21]  <Motoko> And they just left you there?
[25-Jan-2012 07:51:38]  <Lou> Yes.
[25-Jan-2012 07:52:29]  <Lou> It was quiet.  I tried to map the base, but they always change it anyway.
[25-Jan-2012 07:56:52]  <Lou> It didn't make any sense to me at the time.  I guess that's why I thought of it.
[25-Jan-2012 07:57:23]  <Motoko> Did you ever find out why they did it?
[25-Jan-2012 07:58:24]  <Lou> Like I said, I think it was just to see how well trained I was.  That they could order me without ordering.
[25-Jan-2012 08:01:07]  <Motoko> I'm not really sure what to say.
[25-Jan-2012 08:01:44]  <Lou> Mm.  It's just further casting against the forces of movie clichés.
[25-Jan-2012 08:03:44]  <Motoko> Maybe now they'll yell "cut!" and throw all the lights back on and pull all the cameras out of hiding.
[25-Jan-2012 08:04:21]  <Motoko> They'll look at you and ask something like "Didn't you read the script?" And you'll say you didn't, and get in an argument with the director.
[25-Jan-2012 08:04:34]  <Lou> And you?
[25-Jan-2012 08:06:39]  <Motoko> Wander to the trailer and sneak a donut while no one is looking.
[25-Jan-2012 08:07:28]  <Lou> I guess opportunism would work better...
[25-Jan-2012 08:10:57]  <Motoko> 14Bedtime plus, oh, three hours.
[25-Jan-2012 08:11:16]  <Lou> 14Is that your way of saying you're going to sleep.
[25-Jan-2012 08:11:33]  <Motoko> 14Join us next time for more of the exciting adventures of LOUTOKO IN EMPTINESS!
[25-Jan-2012 08:11:54]  <Lou> 14Can't even come up with your own Episode 25.  Gawd.
[25-Jan-2012 08:11:56]  <Motoko> 14Yes, sleep. Thanks. Bye.
[25-Jan-2012 08:12:04]  <Lou> 14Aloha.
