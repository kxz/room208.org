@time=2011-09-18T22:54:23.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Loki_Weyland: As soon as you try leaving the office, the nurse stops you.  "Can I help you with something?"  (I'm totally being nice right now)
@time=2011-09-18T22:54:37.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :"Ah, yeah."
@time=2011-09-18T22:54:53.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :"I think there was something in the food that didn't agree with me."
@time=2011-09-18T22:55:09.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :14So even with three fate points, that's four rolls = .15 + .85 * .15 + .85^2 * .15 + .85^3 * .15 < 48%
@time=2011-09-18T22:55:12.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Motoko: If you need to leave, I think we'll pretty much end this session after this scene is done.
@time=2011-09-18T22:55:20.000Z :Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[I think you can only reroll once in each case.]
@time=2011-09-18T22:55:25.000Z :Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[in each case you wat ar eroll*]
@time=2011-09-18T22:55:55.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Loki_Weyland: "Oh, yeah, cafeteria food will do that sometimes if you're not used to it.  Would you like to rest a bit?  We have a spare bed."
@time=2011-09-18T22:56:02.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :"Sure, thanks."
@time=2011-09-18T22:56:56.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :(Anything else?)
@time=2011-09-18T22:57:18.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Loki waits for a bit to see if the nurse will leave.
@time=2011-09-18T22:57:26.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Is there a computer in the office?
@time=2011-09-18T22:57:35.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :She looks thoroughly involved with paperwork.
@time=2011-09-18T22:57:58.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :And no, there isn't, save for the one that at the nurse's currently occupied desk.
@time=2011-09-18T22:58:28.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :14Okay, I'm checking out for now. Let me know how Loki_Weyland's escapades go later...
@time=2011-09-18T22:58:35.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :K.
@time=2011-09-18T22:58:35.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Loki thinks for a bit.
@time=2011-09-18T22:58:36.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Bye.
@time=2011-09-18T22:58:42.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :$ Should I mention what Loki's trying to do?
@time=2011-09-18T22:58:53.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Sure?
@time=2011-09-18T22:59:05.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[ah]
@time=2011-09-18T22:59:07.000Z :Jaqueline_de_Maquerel PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :(( Later. ))
@time=2011-09-18T22:59:09.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[we're still going?]
@time=2011-09-18T22:59:13.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :$ He's trying to put a keylogger on the network.
@time=2011-09-18T22:59:15.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Lou: I guess.
@time=2011-09-18T22:59:24.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :$ The Fire alarm was to get everyone out of the office.
@time=2011-09-18T22:59:31.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :14That's definitely an advanced skill, Loki_Weyland!
@time=2011-09-18T22:59:38.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[Why would you want to keylog a school?]
@time=2011-09-18T22:59:43.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[And yeah, need moar skill checks]
@time=2011-09-18T23:00:08.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :$ To find out dirt on people. In specific, he's wary about the class rep's "connections".
@time=2011-09-18T23:00:11.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Loki_Weyland: Yeah, looking at your character sheet, there's only a /very/ slim chance you can pull that off.
@time=2011-09-18T23:00:36.000Z :Jaqueline_de_Maquerel PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :(( It's probably a very basic keylogger. Most schools have shit security. Especially public ones. ))
@time=2011-09-18T23:00:51.000Z :Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[Roll for Awareness: Realizing he's not good enough to pull this off? :P]
@time=2011-09-18T23:01:01.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :$ As for the keylogger, he's a script kiddie. I seriously doubt he'd be able to write that thing himself.
@time=2011-09-18T23:01:09.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Yeah, I figured.
@time=2011-09-18T23:01:26.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[Even if you use someone else's keylogger, it's nontrivial to be able to use it effectively and things.]
@time=2011-09-18T23:01:48.000Z :Jaqueline_de_Maquerel PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :(( I remember some really angry RPer trying to hack a major comic book board's site after we laughed her out of a game. There's crack packs like that everywhere, if you know where to look. ))
@time=2011-09-18T23:02:04.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Still, everything that would be required to pull it off, I don't think it'll be happening today.
@time=2011-09-18T23:02:13.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :After deliberation, Loki decides that he shouldn't try anything right now. He could probably install it right now by asking the nurse, but that'd leave a very visible trail.
@time=2011-09-18T23:02:46.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[also wait, does Loki just carry around a keylogger in case he runs into mafiosos?]
@time=2011-09-18T23:03:02.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :$ He has a flash drive and a laptop with him. That's why he got it out earlier.
@time=2011-09-18T23:03:05.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[now I want to do that]
@time=2011-09-18T23:03:21.000Z :Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[mafiosi*]
@time=2011-09-18T23:03:40.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[fuck your talians]
@time=2011-09-18T23:03:54.000Z :Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[he coulda maybe downloaded it off the internet]
@time=2011-09-18T23:04:00.000Z :Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[though that's also kinda traily]
@time=2011-09-18T23:04:11.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :A short while passes, and Loki gets up. "I think I'm feeling better now, thanks. I'll go back to class now."
@time=2011-09-18T23:04:25.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :"All right.  Feel free to come back if it gets worse".
@time=2011-09-18T23:04:40.000Z :Lou PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[information warfare would sure be fun(ny), though~!]
@time=2011-09-18T23:04:46.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :$ And yeah, he downloaded it off the internet a while ago. He's used it before, he just doesn't know a thing about programming."
@time=2011-09-18T23:05:40.000Z :Jaqueline_de_Maquerel PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Where were you, Loki?
@time=2011-09-18T23:05:53.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :"Nurse's office. The food didn't sit well with me."
@time=2011-09-18T23:06:35.000Z :Jaqueline_de_Maquerel PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :ACTION raises an eyebrow. "It's better than stuff from yankland... or some schools in China."
@time=2011-09-18T23:08:11.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :"American school food is about as good as a prison meal, I say."
@time=2011-09-18T23:08:17.000Z :Gendo PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I think I'm going to end the session now.  I wasn't going to play through afterschool until after I run Osip's thing, and write out the press release.
@time=2011-09-18T23:08:38.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :$ Sure.
@time=2011-09-18T23:08:43.000Z :Loki_Weyland PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :$ ENTERING META NOW.
@time=2011-09-18T23:08:45.000Z :Osip_Zhgun[Barcode] PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :[S'fine by me.]
