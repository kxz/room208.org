@time=2011-11-04T06:26:30.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :hey, Motoko.  Eiri was looking for you.
@time=2011-11-04T06:26:38.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :... who?
@time=2011-11-04T06:27:03.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :The lab technician who hates his job.  He does the sync exams when that girl is out.
@time=2011-11-04T06:27:25.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Are you feeling better?
@time=2011-11-04T06:27:42.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Than when?
@time=2011-11-04T06:28:17.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :When your persona bifurcate.  Which has happened a few times, I suppose.
@time=2011-11-04T06:28:41.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :And how exactly would you expect me to be *aware* of that?
@time=2011-11-04T06:29:44.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I don't know.  It could be an act.  Psychologists don't believe that identity disssociation is real, you know.
@time=2011-11-04T06:29:47.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Not that you should trust them.
@time=2011-11-04T06:30:12.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :That's their problem, not mine.
@time=2011-11-04T06:31:21.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :True enough.
@time=2011-11-04T06:32:07.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You don't seem surprised by the suggestion that you are mentally abnormal?
@time=2011-11-04T06:32:22.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :That wasn't a question.  Sorry.
@time=2011-11-04T06:33:18.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Maybe, Lout, it's because, oh, I don't know, I get called a mental patient every other day in here?
@time=2011-11-04T06:33:48.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Surely you have a stricter set of criteria by now.
@time=2011-11-04T06:34:10.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Though I suppose most of us wouldn't really be considered insane.  Just unfit to live.
@time=2011-11-04T06:34:30.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I'm not in the armchair psychology business!
@time=2011-11-04T06:34:47.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Do you lose time?
@time=2011-11-04T06:36:17.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Lout, I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
@time=2011-11-04T06:36:40.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Why?
@time=2011-11-04T06:38:33.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I think I've talked quite enough about insanity for one day, thanks.
@time=2011-11-04T06:39:00.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Very well.
@time=2011-11-04T06:39:32.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :That man still wanted to talk to you, though.  I guess you can put it off.
@time=2011-11-04T06:40:15.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :If he was looking for me for reasons like this, it's probably better that I don't see him.
@time=2011-11-04T06:40:33.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :"Like this?"
@time=2011-11-04T06:40:43.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :This is just me asking questions, sorry.
@time=2011-11-04T06:40:49.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Psychowhatever.
@time=2011-11-04T06:42:09.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Oh.  Well.  That's half of what they ever ask us, anyway...
@time=2011-11-04T06:43:20.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It's probably half of what this entire program is about.
@time=2011-11-04T06:43:34.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You have no idea.
@time=2011-11-04T06:43:38.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I wouldn't be surprised if it were some twisted researcher's mental experiment.
@time=2011-11-04T06:44:01.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :...quite
@time=2011-11-04T06:44:38.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Oh.  By the way.  Do they let your friends respond?
@time=2011-11-04T06:44:42.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You sound like you know something about this...
@time=2011-11-04T06:44:57.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :...respond? To what?
@time=2011-11-04T06:45:12.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Your messages.
@time=2011-11-04T06:45:28.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :They let Cassie go on that trip, but I suppose her friends aren't civilians, like yours
@time=2011-11-04T06:45:55.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I didn't even hear that she'd left...
@time=2011-11-04T06:46:31.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :They haven't even let me talk to anyone outside for the past few days.
@time=2011-11-04T06:47:01.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You'll learn to pay more attention to their "security" after a while.
@time=2011-11-04T06:47:27.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :yes, she did.  You should probably watch out for Jacqueline, on that note.
@time=2011-11-04T06:47:39.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :As if I weren't already...
@time=2011-11-04T06:48:00.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Is she up to something else again?
@time=2011-11-04T06:48:51.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It's just that now she has one less... target?
@time=2011-11-04T06:49:44.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Oh, right.
@time=2011-11-04T06:49:58.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Thanks for the tip...
@time=2011-11-04T06:51:07.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Do you know where Cassie's gone?
@time=2011-11-04T06:51:39.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Some American base.  They won't say which, obviously, not that it would mean much to me.  Or you.
@time=2011-11-04T06:51:48.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :er.  Canadian.  I get those confused.
@time=2011-11-04T06:52:56.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :So a stint back home?
@time=2011-11-04T06:53:07.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :yes.
@time=2011-11-04T06:53:21.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I envy her sometimes...
@time=2011-11-04T06:53:43.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Why?  The two of you are the least broken.
@time=2011-11-04T06:54:02.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :She just seems to fit in here so much better, while I'm... wait, broken?
@time=2011-11-04T06:54:45.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I thought you didn't want to talk about "psychowhatever".
@time=2011-11-04T06:55:04.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :And of course she does!  She's been in this situation for her whole life.
@time=2011-11-04T06:55:34.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Yeah, maybe.
@time=2011-11-04T06:56:23.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I don't want to talk about that kind of... diagnosis type of thing, but I want to say something about how I feel, you know?
@time=2011-11-04T06:56:34.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Okay.
@time=2011-11-04T06:57:18.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :After all, I think my mom was right. You can't live for long with all your emotions bottled up.
@time=2011-11-04T06:57:41.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I'm sorry about my little... outburst earlier.
@time=2011-11-04T06:57:55.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I just needed to get it out.
@time=2011-11-04T06:58:13.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Better here than on the battlefield.
@time=2011-11-04T06:59:53.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I think even then the techs would find some way to use it for offensive purposes.
@time=2011-11-04T07:00:27.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Some kind of superpower triggered by feeling emotionally overwhelmed.
@time=2011-11-04T07:00:36.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :...I suppose that is their job.  But that seems far-fetched.
@time=2011-11-04T07:00:51.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Everything seems far-fetched here to me.
@time=2011-11-04T07:01:59.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It's relative.  Even if it seems strange to you, it has its own set of strange rules, and I don't think those rules include that.
@time=2011-11-04T07:02:35.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :though.  That does raise the possibility that they're trying to break you.  Hm.
@time=2011-11-04T07:02:56.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Well, I don't know any of the rules. They could probably persuade me that they're divine messengers by the end of next week.
@time=2011-11-04T07:03:34.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :And it's not like I don't have baggage of my own that I'm already having trouble dealing with...
@time=2011-11-04T07:04:46.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You'll deal with it.  Or you won't, and continue being somewhat stressed.  Or it will be cut off by death.  Probably one of those.
@time=2011-11-04T07:05:06.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Optimistic, aren't you?
@time=2011-11-04T07:05:51.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You're pretty negative yourself.
@time=2011-11-04T07:07:19.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Yeah, a little.
@time=2011-11-04T07:07:43.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Some of it's just sarcasm, don't worry.
@time=2011-11-04T07:08:29.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Sarcasm is probably a healthier reaction than enjoying it.  Or some kind of sociopathy.  Or just acting normally.
@time=2011-11-04T07:09:49.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :That's what I kept telling myself back home, that it was a way of coping with stress.
@time=2011-11-04T07:10:04.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I don't know if it really helps, but it makes me feel a little better.
@time=2011-11-04T07:11:00.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I wouldn't know.
@time=2011-11-04T07:11:45.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It's not like anybody really knows, anyway.
@time=2011-11-04T07:11:58.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I can keep convincing myself that it's okay that way!
@time=2011-11-04T07:13:26.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You're a very pragmatic person, miss Iwatani.  I'm glad they picked you instead of... I don't know.  More of Weyland.
@time=2011-11-04T07:14:11.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I think you're the first person who's ever called me that.
@time=2011-11-04T07:14:15.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :"Pragmatic", I mean.
@time=2011-11-04T07:16:04.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It could be that you're normal for your type, and I haven't met enough to realize this.  Or you could only say such things after an outburst.  Or you could conceal it most of the time, and are showing me for whatever reason.  Or any number of things.
@time=2011-11-04T07:17:25.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I think a lot of people back home thought I was just impulsive -- I guess that's not, strictly speaking, *false*, but...
@time=2011-11-04T07:18:31.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You could need more than one adjective.

@time=2011-11-04T07:19:17.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :ACTION tilts head
@time=2011-11-04T07:19:41.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :That's the oddest way I've ever heard that phrased.
@time=2011-11-04T07:19:54.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Heard what?
@time=2011-11-04T07:20:28.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :... *that*. I don't know how to put it, but that!
@time=2011-11-04T07:20:40.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You know, talking with you is kind of refreshing.
@time=2011-11-04T07:21:14.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :If you say so.
@time=2011-11-04T07:21:24.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :The same goes for you.  I hadn't met someone like you yet.
@time=2011-11-04T07:22:14.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It's... I don't know, you don't say what I expect you to say, but in a good way.
@time=2011-11-04T07:22:39.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Like... I have to really think about what I'm saying.
@time=2011-11-04T07:23:18.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :With expected things, it's easy to slip into practiced patterns.
@time=2011-11-04T07:23:53.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Exactly.
@time=2011-11-04T07:24:39.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :The conversations we have are unique... special, because we don't do that.
@time=2011-11-04T07:24:51.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I don't think we could even if we tried.
@time=2011-11-04T07:25:31.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :That would be a strange thing to try.
@time=2011-11-04T07:25:52.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It would be, wouldn't it?
@time=2011-11-04T07:26:21.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You could write out a conversation beforehand, then refuse to deviate from your script.  If you got it wrong, it would be pretty silly.  And it would be hard to avoid deviation at that point.
@time=2011-11-04T07:26:38.000Z :JackMackerel NICK Jack|Shower
@time=2011-11-04T07:27:00.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I'm not a very good actress, sorry to say.
@time=2011-11-04T07:27:09.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I always had trouble remembering lines...
@time=2011-11-04T07:27:31.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :It's something you can practice as well.
@time=2011-11-04T07:28:02.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I could, but I don't think I'm cut out for it.
@time=2011-11-04T07:28:25.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Maybe I'd do better at improv? I doubt there's a company on base, though...
@time=2011-11-04T07:29:38.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I don't know what that means.  Anyway, you don't have to, of course.  It's just a hypothetical.  Humans can't force themselves to do that anyway.
@time=2011-11-04T07:30:02.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Oh.  and.  You'll probably come up with a pattern for me if you don't die.  It just happens.
@time=2011-11-04T07:30:06.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Or I don't die.
@time=2011-11-04T07:31:50.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Then we'll just have to make it out of this together, so I can find out.
@time=2011-11-04T07:32:11.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I know you probably can't promise me that you won't die, but...
@time=2011-11-04T07:33:05.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I try not to.  It's painful.
@time=2011-11-04T07:34:31.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Can you at least promise me that you'll try your hardest to survive?
@time=2011-11-04T07:35:37.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Of course.
@time=2011-11-04T07:35:51.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :You too.  Don't test for emotion-powered superabilities.
@time=2011-11-04T07:36:36.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Maybe we can get Jacqueline to do that.
@time=2011-11-04T07:36:40.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :ACTION laughs
@time=2011-11-04T07:37:36.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Yeah, that sounds like a decent idea. I'll just make sure I get out of here alive.
@time=2011-11-04T07:37:51.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :... and thanks.
@time=2011-11-04T07:38:52.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Same to you.
@time=2011-11-04T07:39:38.000Z :Jack|Shower PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :(( How so? Threaten to stab everyone? ))
@time=2011-11-04T07:40:28.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :aa~h, the ringing in my ears is back. Maybe I didn't sleep that hangover off all the way...
@time=2011-11-04T07:40:57.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :I'm going to head back to bed. See you later, Lou!
@time=2011-11-04T07:41:06.000Z :Lout PRIVMSG #MadokaMadness :Goodbye, Motoko.
