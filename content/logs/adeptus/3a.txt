[16-Sep-2011 05:14:59]  *** Teargarden is now known as Tyrgardenz
[16-Sep-2011 05:15:04]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki holds the practice knife loosely by one handle.
[16-Sep-2011 05:15:09]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel raps at Loki's door.
[16-Sep-2011 05:15:16]  <Loki_Weyland> Yeah?
[16-Sep-2011 05:15:23]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> "Knock knock? Who's there~? Me me me me me me me..."
[16-Sep-2011 05:15:23]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Nix the first line.
[16-Sep-2011 05:15:51]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki runs over to the door and opens it.
[16-Sep-2011 05:16:04]  <Loki_Weyland> "Hey."
[16-Sep-2011 05:16:07]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> "Here's Jackie~"
[16-Sep-2011 05:16:08]  <Loki_Weyland> "Time for the lesson, then?"
[16-Sep-2011 05:16:26]  <Loki_Weyland> "This'll be fun, I'm sure. And painful."
[16-Sep-2011 05:16:41]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel nods, and hefts a... is that a training dummy? It looks life-like and realistically jointed... and has a great number of slashes, most at the throat or stomach.
[16-Sep-2011 05:16:58]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki raises his eyebrows.
[16-Sep-2011 05:17:31]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Figured we'd do more blade tricks with it, too~. See, butterfly knives get a rap because they're harder to grip than most knives.
[16-Sep-2011 05:17:49]  <Loki_Weyland> "That's the point of butterfly knife tricks, isn't it?"
[16-Sep-2011 05:18:37]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel nodnods. "Kinda hard to manipulate it when there's a good grip. Plus, it was made to be manipulated with one hand.
[16-Sep-2011 05:19:09]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> And it depends on the knife, too, see.
[16-Sep-2011 05:19:15]  <Loki_Weyland> "Looks like it, yeah."
[16-Sep-2011 05:19:24]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel drops the dummy in a corner and drops a duffle bag on the floor. Heavily.
[16-Sep-2011 05:19:25]  <Loki_Weyland> "I'm ambidextrous, by the way."
[16-Sep-2011 05:19:47]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel opens the bag. "Ah, really~? That's a plus. Easier to do multihanded tricks~"
[16-Sep-2011 05:20:01]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( Man, I'm making her way too friendly and not creepy enough. ))
[16-Sep-2011 05:20:09]  <Tyrgardenz> [rape]
[16-Sep-2011 05:20:14]  <Loki_Weyland> "Erm, shouldn't those be saved for later? I mean, I've never really done this before."
[16-Sep-2011 05:20:21]  <Tyrgardenz> [innuendo]
[16-Sep-2011 05:20:54]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel turns and grins. "Oh, I'll teach you. Don't worry, I'll be gentle. You'll like it."
[16-Sep-2011 05:21:04]  <Loki_Weyland> "I'm sure."
[16-Sep-2011 05:21:07]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Here, let's start with a basic design!
[16-Sep-2011 05:21:13]  <Loki_Weyland> "OK."
[16-Sep-2011 05:21:51]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel takes two out. They're both extremely generic looking, and she does a variety of completely unnessecery tricks with them before holding both out, handle first, to Loki.
[16-Sep-2011 05:22:08]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki grabs one, uneasily.
[16-Sep-2011 05:23:23]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel grins.
[16-Sep-2011 05:24:02]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Okay, so here, listen closely...
[16-Sep-2011 05:24:28]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel violates personal space and points out alllllllllll the pieces of a butterfly knife, the mechanism, and slowly demonstrates a simple open/close.
[16-Sep-2011 05:24:42]  <Loki_Weyland> "Uh-huh."
[16-Sep-2011 05:24:47]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (I'd stretch that out, but I'm too lazy to do so, and I fear I'd fuck up a part.)
[16-Sep-2011 05:24:56]  <Loki_Weyland> $ I'll change it later.
[16-Sep-2011 05:24:59]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Here, try it. It's all in the wrist.
[16-Sep-2011 05:25:03]  <Loki_Weyland> $ We'll fix it in post!
[16-Sep-2011 05:25:08]  <Loki_Weyland> "OK."
[16-Sep-2011 05:25:10]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (Actually, if you want, we can retcon it and do the long explanation, should we?)
[16-Sep-2011 05:25:18]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Later.
[16-Sep-2011 05:25:29]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( K. ))
[16-Sep-2011 05:25:38]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Slowly...
[16-Sep-2011 05:25:44]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki unlocks the handle and attempts a simple flip.
[16-Sep-2011 05:25:58]  <Loki_Weyland> He accidentally pokes himself with the blade.
[16-Sep-2011 05:26:02]  <Loki_Weyland> "Ow!"
[16-Sep-2011 05:26:43]  <Loki_Weyland> "OK, that didn't work. Let's try something else."
[16-Sep-2011 05:26:44]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> ...
[16-Sep-2011 05:27:04]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel stares at the injury and seriously looks like she's about to lick it for a bit.
[16-Sep-2011 05:27:04]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki holds one handle, letting the knife go limp.
[16-Sep-2011 05:27:13]  <Loki_Weyland> He flicks it, trying to get it to close.
[16-Sep-2011 05:27:22]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Firmly grasp it...
[16-Sep-2011 05:27:24]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel grins.
[16-Sep-2011 05:27:31]  <Loki_Weyland> The knife flies out of his hand, landing on the floor.
[16-Sep-2011 05:27:36]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> ...
[16-Sep-2011 05:27:42]  <Loki_Weyland> "Crap,"
[16-Sep-2011 05:27:56]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Don't worry, it's your first time~ I said I'd be gentle. Here...
[16-Sep-2011 05:28:04]  <Loki_Weyland> "Thanks."
[16-Sep-2011 05:28:10]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel takes the knife and places it in Loki's hand.
[16-Sep-2011 05:28:21]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel grabs his hand suddenly and goes through the motions. How does she do that, I don't know.
[16-Sep-2011 05:28:26]  <Tyrgardenz> [uh, glad I could help ._.]
[16-Sep-2011 05:28:51]  <Loki_Weyland> "Huh. Yeah, I think I get it."
[16-Sep-2011 05:29:02]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( What? ))
[16-Sep-2011 05:29:14]  <Loki_Weyland> "Say, there's something I saw in a video I'd like to try."
[16-Sep-2011 05:29:28]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Oh~?
[16-Sep-2011 05:29:40]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> You got it on hand? I didn't see a laptop~
[16-Sep-2011 05:29:54]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Here, lemme see you do it without my help first.
[16-Sep-2011 05:30:03]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Shush, I'm writing.
[16-Sep-2011 05:31:05]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki holds the knife limp again, flips it in the air, and catches it with his other hand. He then weaves the handles through his fingers before passing the blade back to his left hand. He then flips it some more, ending in a downward stabbing position.
[16-Sep-2011 05:31:09]  <Loki_Weyland> "...Cool!"
[16-Sep-2011 05:31:37]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel grins, nodding approvingly. "Yes, that's what I like to see. I thought you said you've never done this before~?"
[16-Sep-2011 05:31:41]  <Loki_Weyland> He attempts to repeat the maneuver. It flies out of his hand on the first flip.
[16-Sep-2011 05:31:51]  <Loki_Weyland> "Fuck."
[16-Sep-2011 05:33:27]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Hmm... close, but you used too much force. You'll get the hang of it.
[16-Sep-2011 05:33:36]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Looks like I'll have to teach you over and over again~
[16-Sep-2011 05:33:49]  <Loki_Weyland> "I wouldn't mind that."
[16-Sep-2011 05:34:02]  <Loki_Weyland> There is a slight grin on Loki's face.
[16-Sep-2011 05:34:42]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( Loki has a rape fetish. ))
[16-Sep-2011 05:34:52]  <Tyrgardenz> [:/]
[16-Sep-2011 05:34:53]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Probably.
[16-Sep-2011 05:35:21]  <Loki_Weyland> $ If so, it's irrelevant.
[16-Sep-2011 05:35:46]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( If Jack gets more unhinged and doesn't creep out on Cassie more... ))
[16-Sep-2011 05:36:11]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Here!
[16-Sep-2011 05:36:29]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel grabs Loki's arm, gets him to pick it back up, and goes through the motions slowly...
[16-Sep-2011 05:37:30]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki follows her lead.
[16-Sep-2011 05:37:51]  <Loki_Weyland> He seems ever so slightly on edge.
[16-Sep-2011 05:38:28]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Then we do it forcefully...
[16-Sep-2011 05:38:35]  <Loki_Weyland> "Eh?"
[16-Sep-2011 05:38:46]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel does it a biiiit too hard, and accidentally cuts them both.
[16-Sep-2011 05:38:47]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> ...
[16-Sep-2011 05:38:55]  <Loki_Weyland> "Shit!"
[16-Sep-2011 05:39:07]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> ...
[16-Sep-2011 05:39:15]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel licks up her blood. "Sorry..."
[16-Sep-2011 05:39:22]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel is giving off massive creeper vibes.
[16-Sep-2011 05:39:23]  <Loki_Weyland> "Eh, it's bound to happen."
[16-Sep-2011 05:39:33]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( DON'T SLEEP, COME ON, GETCHER CREEP ON WITH ME ))
[16-Sep-2011 05:39:52]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Right. I'll try to put more innuendo into the dialogue.
[16-Sep-2011 05:42:47]  <Loki_Weyland> "It's OK."
[16-Sep-2011 05:43:05]  <Loki_Weyland> $ That replaces the previous line, I guess. Unless you can come up with something better.
[16-Sep-2011 05:43:08]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel wipes off Loki's wound and continues on. "Anyway... we should have you just keep practicing that flip~".
[16-Sep-2011 05:43:35]  <Loki_Weyland> "Yeah. It's hard at first, but I'm sure it'll be easier as I do it more."
[16-Sep-2011 05:43:56]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> "It'll come naturally~."
[16-Sep-2011 05:44:50]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Keep it up... let's see~
[16-Sep-2011 05:44:51]  <Loki_Weyland> "In time, I'm sure."
[16-Sep-2011 05:46:27]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel goes on, watching Loki's attempts at flipping it open and closing.
[16-Sep-2011 05:47:20]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki's attempts to manipulate the knife are unsure, cautious.
[16-Sep-2011 05:48:00]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel grabs it again and does it a bit more forcefully.
[16-Sep-2011 05:49:29]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> See, wasn't too hard~.
[16-Sep-2011 05:49:47]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel is waaay too close to Loki.
[16-Sep-2011 05:49:55]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Here, now...
[16-Sep-2011 05:50:09]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel does a highly complex trick that makes it look like she's about to stab Loki several times.
[16-Sep-2011 05:51:17]  <Loki_Weyland> "Cool..."
[16-Sep-2011 05:51:33]  <Tyrgardenz> [breathe heavily!]
[16-Sep-2011 05:52:10]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel leans back and sighs, as if exhausted. "Hard to do, for obvious reasons~"
[16-Sep-2011 05:52:14]  <Loki_Weyland> "OK, I think I've worked up the guts to try something."
[16-Sep-2011 05:52:31]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki tries a flip again, and the blade flies straight up into the air.
[16-Sep-2011 05:52:36]  <Loki_Weyland> "Oops."
[16-Sep-2011 05:52:58]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki catches the knife by the blade on the way down, realizing what he's done halfway through the motion.
[16-Sep-2011 05:53:31]  <Loki_Weyland> He hands it off to his other hand, does a trick, and tosses the device to Jacqueline.
[16-Sep-2011 05:53:37]  <Loki_Weyland> "Jackie! Here!" 
[16-Sep-2011 05:54:03]  <Loki_Weyland> $ This is taking place before the third session, by the way. Unless you object, that is.
[16-Sep-2011 05:54:17]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (It makes sense, not objections for me. )
[16-Sep-2011 05:54:24]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Great.
[16-Sep-2011 05:54:58]  * Jaqueline_de_Maquerel grabs it mid air and spins it repeatedly, making it seem like it's slinking all up and down her arm. "Here, catch it back~"
[16-Sep-2011 05:55:06]  <Loki_Weyland> "Thanks!"
[16-Sep-2011 05:55:32]  <Loki_Weyland> Loki pulls off several expert tricks, before handing it back to his partner.
[16-Sep-2011 05:56:21]  <Loki_Weyland> $ ...handing it off to his partner.
[16-Sep-2011 05:56:59]  <Loki_Weyland> $ In case it wasn't clear, Loki's done this before. He's just screwing with her.
[16-Sep-2011 05:57:25]  <Tyrgardenz> [in the text!  in the text!]
[16-Sep-2011 05:57:34]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( You gave her a reacharound? ))
[16-Sep-2011 05:57:43]  <Loki_Weyland> $ Reacharound?
[16-Sep-2011 05:58:04]  <Tyrgardenz> [metaphors]
[16-Sep-2011 05:58:10]  <Loki_Weyland> $ And yeah, I'll find some what to either imply or outright state that Loki's flipped a butterfly knife before.
[16-Sep-2011 05:58:42]  <Loki_Weyland> $ I was hoping the expert tricks would give it away.
[16-Sep-2011 05:59:13]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Hey, I thought you said you were new at this...
[16-Sep-2011 05:59:24]  <Loki_Weyland> "I am, why?"
[16-Sep-2011 05:59:27]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> (( Did you start novelizing Session Three, by the by? ))
[16-Sep-2011 05:59:40]  <Jaqueline_de_Maquerel> Because a newbie should have sliced open his palm with those tricks.

[16-Sep-2011 08:20:54]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (Hmm...)
[16-Sep-2011 08:20:56]  <Cassie> "I apologize for the outburst pilot Jaqueline. What do you suggest we do first?" asks Cassie trying to move past that lapse of composure.
[16-Sep-2011 08:22:15]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> "S'fine. You're a good kid." She slaps Cassie on the back. "If anything, tells me you're not an asshole! So, if you wanna eat, or get something to drink... if you don't, let's go check out that firing range place. I have enough yen to last quite  a while.
[16-Sep-2011 08:23:32]  <Cassie> "You don't have to pay for everything. I have a decent sum of yen left over after the allocations."
[16-Sep-2011 08:24:26]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Nah, nah. Bullets are expensive! S'why I use knives more often. Less paying for 'em.
[16-Sep-2011 08:25:15]  <Cassie> Cassie smiles "I prefer melee weapons for certainty. Up close it is much easier to confirm if an Angel is actually dead and not playing possum."
[16-Sep-2011 08:26:16]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel grins. "Agreed. Agreed so much. After that, I'll show you that knife shop... I taught some tricks to Loki, so I'll teach you some as well~!"
[16-Sep-2011 08:27:14]  <Cassie> "I'm not sure knives are regulation on base" points out Cassie "My dad got into a lot of trouble when he had a signed baseball bat shipped to him"
[16-Sep-2011 08:27:48]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Really? The base I was at, you could open carry everything! Yeesh, you must have had some psycho go on a rampage for that.
[16-Sep-2011 08:29:21]  <Cassie> "Well a few candidates did snap from the training. One of my friends managed to hold the class hostage with a boxcutter and some rope for a few hours."
[16-Sep-2011 08:30:06]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel guffaws. "Really? He'd fit right in with the prog knives, then."
[16-Sep-2011 08:30:19]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel reaches the gun shop. It's horribly tacky, decked out in eye-watering flashing lights more suited to a Vegas casino than a firing range. Inside are two women who look barely out of high school, one with long red hair and the other wearing glasses and short, black hair. After some haggling and trying to get guns out of their cases, they're on a concrete firing range, with holographic targets in 
[16-Sep-2011 08:31:01]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel holds out a huge-ass revolver and... is that the pallet rifle?
[16-Sep-2011 08:31:07]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Pick one~
[16-Sep-2011 08:31:10]  <Cassie> Cassie frowns "Not anymore. I had to remove some fingers on his dominant hand when he tried to tie me up."
[16-Sep-2011 08:31:25]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (No cutoffs?)
[16-Sep-2011 08:31:41]  <Cassie> (she bit him)
[16-Sep-2011 08:31:55]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (Also, this line is before they reach the firing range) Oh. Niiice.
[16-Sep-2011 08:32:03]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (No, I meant did any text cutoff? :V)
[16-Sep-2011 08:32:34]  <Cassie> (No text cutoff}
[16-Sep-2011 08:32:59]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (K.)
[16-Sep-2011 08:33:37]  <Cassie> Cassie tilts her head at the revolver "Why would you build an Eva sized revolver? That's like trying to make a progressive ball and chain!"
[16-Sep-2011 08:35:33]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> It's a simple design. Less prone to jamming... besides, a progressive ball-and-chain sounds cool. 'sides, this isn't THAT big!
[16-Sep-2011 08:38:26]  <Cassie> "The progressive ball and chain is on the list of projects NERV Toronto is not allowed to restart at any time ever again. A 20 meter spiked ball propelling itself across the countryside, picking up everything in the resonance field, it was doomed a disaster.
[16-Sep-2011 08:38:49]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> ...I was kinda joking, but okay.
[16-Sep-2011 08:39:45]  <Cassie> "They did get valuable field data on the positron weapons when eliminating it though.
[16-Sep-2011 08:41:18]  <Cassie> "... sorry. I'll pick the pallet gun since I have familiarity with that wonder of engineering..." decides Cassie, with obvious contempt for the weapon.
[16-Sep-2011 08:41:34]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Don't knock it. It's not the pallet gun.
[16-Sep-2011 08:42:08]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Heck, the pallet gun just based its shape off it. This thing's called the Steyr ACR! It fires darts. Isn't that awesome?!
[16-Sep-2011 08:42:48]  <Cassie> "I ended up getting more kills in training when I started using that gun as a bludgeon" rants Cassie oblivious to Jaqueline's clarifications.
[16-Sep-2011 08:44:26]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel whistles and slides in very close to Cassie. "Here, I know the EVA gun's a piece of shit, but in the off chance you do have to use it, this might safe your life~." She's right behind Cass and manipulates her arms to hold the ACR properly...
[16-Sep-2011 08:46:23]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel 's mouth is right next to Cass's. "Pull the trigger gently. Like... uh. ...gently."
[16-Sep-2011 08:46:33]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( WOO YURI BAIT ))
[16-Sep-2011 08:46:37]  <Cassie> Cassie freezes up as Jaqueline positions her body. Softly she asks "Is this correct or are further modifications to my posture required?" hoping to hide the waver in her voice.
[16-Sep-2011 08:47:59]  <Cassie> "Understood pilot Jaqueline" mouths Cassie in English. She pulls the trigger.
[16-Sep-2011 08:48:29]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> <Uh... I was about to seriously ask to roll for accuracy, but that'd be dumb. :V>
[16-Sep-2011 08:48:51]  <Cassie> Regrettably she was too distracted to compensate for the recoil and subsequently elbows Jaqueline.
[16-Sep-2011 08:48:59]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Oof...
[16-Sep-2011 08:49:01]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( lul ))
[16-Sep-2011 08:49:49]  <Cassie> "I'm sorry i'm sorry please don't stab me!"
[16-Sep-2011 08:50:02]  <Loki_Weyland> Premature firing?
[16-Sep-2011 08:50:46]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( oh god. ))
[16-Sep-2011 08:51:06]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel blinks. "Why would I ever stab you?"
[16-Sep-2011 08:51:36]  <Cassie> Cassie blinks "Because I accidentally attacked you?" 
[16-Sep-2011 08:52:34]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Unless you tried to murder me, I'd never think of ruining your pretty face~
[16-Sep-2011 08:54:23]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel gets uncomfortably close again. "Let's continue..."
[16-Sep-2011 08:54:40]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( should we draw this out or fast forward? ))
[16-Sep-2011 08:55:53]  <Cassie> (Fast forward before Section 2 chaperones have to storm in and pull them apart)
[16-Sep-2011 08:56:23]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( lul. Hold on, be riiiiiiiiiiight back ))
[16-Sep-2011 08:59:24]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( Back. ))
[16-Sep-2011 08:59:40]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> <Some hours and thousands of spent shells later...>
[16-Sep-2011 08:59:54]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> See, wasn't so bad, was it? Knives are still better, though.
[16-Sep-2011 09:00:04]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel inches closer to Cassie.
[16-Sep-2011 09:00:26]  <Cassie> "Yes. My fingers don't hurt after holding a knife or spear for so long."
[16-Sep-2011 09:01:03]  <Cassie> Cassie withdraws her posture into a tighter profile, but otherwise allows the encroachment.
[16-Sep-2011 09:02:34]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Good! Let's go for those blades, then~
[16-Sep-2011 09:02:40]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel 's grin is getting disturbing.
[16-Sep-2011 09:02:59]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> <KNIFE SHOP: Run by some Swedish guy who looks like he's going to eat both of them for breakfast>
[16-Sep-2011 09:03:08]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (>implying Jack's smile is never disturbing)
[16-Sep-2011 09:03:30]  <Cassie> "Bork bork bork" mumbles Cassie quietly
[16-Sep-2011 09:03:53]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> @yt regular ordinary swedish meal time

[16-Sep-2011 09:04:43]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel leads Cassie over to a wall of knives. LOTS OF THEM.
[16-Sep-2011 09:04:57]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> See something you'd like? I promised I'd teach you some tricks~!
[16-Sep-2011 09:05:53]  <Cassie> Cassie selects a switchblade with a snake pattern etched on. "
[16-Sep-2011 09:06:04]  <Cassie> "I think this one looks pretty"
[16-Sep-2011 09:06:07]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Nice~.
[16-Sep-2011 09:07:18]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Great quality, too, especially for one of that pattern. Most cheapo companies just slap that pattern on to sucker in teens who played too much Call of Battle and people who don't know what they're doing.
[16-Sep-2011 09:07:57]  <Cassie> "Call of Battle?"
[16-Sep-2011 09:08:32]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel blinks and stares. "You haven't heard? It's the most popular realistic FPS out there!"
[16-Sep-2011 09:08:37]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( :V ))
[16-Sep-2011 09:09:18]  <Cassie> "FPS? Um... oh is it a lying game? Fabrications per second!" asks Cassie earnestly?
[16-Sep-2011 09:09:51]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> "No, silly. It stands for first person shooter. Like, it puts you through the eyes of a soldier."
[16-Sep-2011 09:10:10]  <Cassie> "But I'm already a soldier..."
[16-Sep-2011 09:10:47]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> 'Cept you don't blow away terrorists by the dozen. Anyway, lemme show you something.
[16-Sep-2011 09:11:11]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel does that personal space violation again and grabs Cassie's hand, showing her a bunch of bizarre tricks that should have gotten them both stabbed.
[16-Sep-2011 09:11:13]  <Loki_Weyland> Realistic, my ass.
[16-Sep-2011 09:12:11]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( Call of Battle: Armed. I dunno what's the other competing modern warfare FPS... ))
[16-Sep-2011 09:12:36]  <Cassie> "Um pilot Jaqueline, this tricks are impressive and all, but wouldn't learning to stab for vital areas while maintaining a defense be more practical?"
[16-Sep-2011 09:13:50]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Sure~
[16-Sep-2011 09:14:15]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel steps up to a training dummy and jams the blade on the side of its neck.
[16-Sep-2011 09:14:49]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Don't do that slashing motion they do in the film unless you can't get in too close, this ensures you'll do damage.
[16-Sep-2011 09:17:08]  <Cassie> "Understood. Thank you for the instruction pilot Jaqueline." Cassie hurries off to buy her knife and asks "What would you like to do next? The night must not have been very fun for you, running me through weapon drills and what not"
[16-Sep-2011 09:19:17]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel grins. "Oh, it was very fun... here, I'll buy you a few more. I have more back at base if you need any more~."
[16-Sep-2011 09:23:43]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (Blargh, sorry.)
[16-Sep-2011 09:24:30]  <Cassie> (It's fine. OTher convo and whatever else)
[16-Sep-2011 09:25:30]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (Should we make this noncanon, or?)
[16-Sep-2011 09:26:37]  <Cassie> (Yeah or just drop the pretense of Jaq getting Cassie over her fail angst and more in being her pestering Cassie for a night on the town)
[16-Sep-2011 09:27:12]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( Actually, Jack isn't even aware of her angst. :V ))
[16-Sep-2011 09:27:42]  <Cassie> (She ranted about it on the radio channel)
[16-Sep-2011 09:27:56]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( Oh, right. Argh. ))
[16-Sep-2011 09:28:03]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> (( It's a bit of both. ))
[16-Sep-2011 09:31:58]  * Jaqueline_de_Macquerel drags Cassie out, passing by landmarks and Jacquline half-assing explanations along the way, getting lost, stopping at random ramen booths, scaring away cats, and occasionally finding huge-ass arcades. Like this one.
[16-Sep-2011 09:34:25]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> Hey, go play a game, or something! You need to start on that~
[16-Sep-2011 09:37:04]  <Cassie> (Can we pick this up later? I'm tired and I have to go to bed soon since I have work in the morning
[16-Sep-2011 09:38:30]  <Jaqueline_de_Macquerel> ( Same here. Sure. :V )
