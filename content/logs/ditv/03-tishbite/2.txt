[05-Aug-2012 20:04:04]  <Motoko`kaseijin> A quick recap: Rashi and Gideon are looking into the trade route dispute.
[05-Aug-2012 20:04:34]  *** Barcode is now known as Barcodexcursion
[05-Aug-2012 20:05:00]  <Motoko`kaseijin> They've already talked to Brother Lee, the branch Steward, and are in the middle of a conversation with Brother Travis, the route's biggest proponent in town, when he's interrupted by a call at the door from Sister Abigail. You may remember her as the one who dragged Sister Nora out of the watering hole.
[05-Aug-2012 20:06:56]  <Rashi> yessir.
[05-Aug-2012 20:07:17]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 07-22 23:42 <Motoko`kaseijin> Travis has a short conversation with someone outside. Though any view outside is blocked Travis' figure in the doorway, the voice unmistakably belongs to Sister Abigail, from earlier.
[05-Aug-2012 20:07:21]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 07-22 23:45 <Motoko`kaseijin> Most of the words are unintelligible, but Travis can be heard saying "I have guests over now, but perhaps later will do?"
[05-Aug-2012 20:07:25]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 07-22 23:46 <Motoko`kaseijin> "There won't be [???] here then?" Abigail responds.
[05-Aug-2012 20:07:28]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 07-22 23:46 <Motoko`kaseijin> "Yes, I can assure you that. Until then?"
[05-Aug-2012 20:07:31]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 07-22 23:47 <Motoko`kaseijin> Travis walks back over to the table where Rashi and Gideon are seated, and says, "Sorry about that. What were we talking about again...?" **
[05-Aug-2012 20:09:38]  <Gideon> ((May be a bit slow, dealing with #yf))
[05-Aug-2012 20:09:56]  <Rashi> [and travis was the nice guy, right]
[05-Aug-2012 20:10:08]  <Rashi> [sorry for lighting the anthill on fire, by the way.  i'm so cranky]
[05-Aug-2012 20:10:11]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Is something going on th... oh.
[05-Aug-2012 20:10:37]  <Gideon> ((No big deal, I had to stop myself from doing the same thing.))
[05-Aug-2012 20:14:34]  <Gideon> "I believe we were discussing the trade route, but you've managed to sway me, Brother," Gideon says. "You seem to have a handle on things here."

[05-Aug-2012 20:16:32]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Oh, thank you, Brother. I'm not so bold as to ask you to lobby the elders on my behalf, but I appreciate your lending an ear." **
[05-Aug-2012 20:19:15]  * Gideon finishes his tea and glances at Rashi to see if he's satisfied with Travis' reasoning.
[05-Aug-2012 20:19:47]  <Rashi> "Listening is the least we can do."
[05-Aug-2012 20:21:30]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "All the same, thank you. Will you be on your way out, then?" **
[05-Aug-2012 20:21:48]  * Gideon nods and stands. "Thank you very much for the tea."
[05-Aug-2012 20:22:48]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14That was the Steward, but -- "Oh, of course." 14-- we can always pretend. **
[05-Aug-2012 20:23:31]  <Gideon> ((Bluh, logs and skimming))
[05-Aug-2012 20:24:40]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Travis follows Rashi and Gideon out the door, and bids them farewell. **
[05-Aug-2012 20:25:41]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14So, now what do you two want to do?
[05-Aug-2012 20:26:05]  * Gideon thanks Travis again and walks far enough away to be out of earshot before turning to Rashi. "He seems to have a decent reason for supporting the trade route. Perhaps we should let that run its course without intervening."
[05-Aug-2012 20:26:06]  <Rashi> "Well, that was nicer than I'd feared."
[05-Aug-2012 20:26:24]  <Gideon> "Yeah, nobody got shot or possessed for once."
[05-Aug-2012 20:26:34]  * Rashi laughs nervously
[05-Aug-2012 20:26:58]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Well, if you leave post-haste you can pretend you never saw anything, right? ^_^
[05-Aug-2012 20:27:16]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14But that might leave you with a nagging feeling of not having done much...
[05-Aug-2012 20:27:54]  <Gideon> ((Is there a better word for the café place than café place?))
[05-Aug-2012 20:28:12]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14I called it a watering hole.
[05-Aug-2012 20:28:51]  <Gideon> "The girls from the watering hole were a little… off-putting though," Gideon says.

[05-Aug-2012 20:29:54]  <Rashi> "Off-putting?  Sure, they're well-off, but they just seemed like regular kids."
[05-Aug-2012 20:30:00]  <Rashi> "Well, Sister Abigail does, at least."
[05-Aug-2012 20:30:21]  <Rashi> [abby was the one who wasn't a spook, right]
[05-Aug-2012 20:30:23]  <Xeniera> Motoko`kaseijin: Am I to assume that you're a martian?
[05-Aug-2012 20:30:36]  <Rashi> [yup]
[05-Aug-2012 20:30:39]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Yes. We're running Dogs, Xeniera.
[05-Aug-2012 20:30:45]  <Xeniera> Oh, sorry.
[05-Aug-2012 20:30:53]  <Gideon> ((Abby was the one who visited Travis while we were talking. Nora was the spooky one.))
[05-Aug-2012 20:30:54]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14No worries.
[05-Aug-2012 20:31:17]  <Rashi> [right.]
[05-Aug-2012 20:32:20]  <Gideon> "Perhaps we should check on them surreptitiously? Just in case?" Gideon says. "Unless you think our time would be better spent elsewhere."
[05-Aug-2012 20:33:26]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Oh, Xeniera, I probably wouldn't have joined in the viewing even if you'd harangued me. Midnight is too late for me to do much of anything nowadays. >_>
[05-Aug-2012 20:35:05]  <Rashi> "Surreptitiously... well, alright."
[05-Aug-2012 20:35:40]  <Gideon> ((I think we can make that into a conflict of some sort. ^_^))
[05-Aug-2012 20:35:40]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Haha, who's the spook *now*?
[05-Aug-2012 20:36:15]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Okay, then...
[05-Aug-2012 20:36:52]  <Motoko`kaseijin> After gathering some intelligence (i.e., asking Brother Zeph at the watering hole where they live), Rashi and Gideon head over to Abigail and Nora's place.
[05-Aug-2012 20:37:21]  *** Xeniera is now known as Solstace
[05-Aug-2012 20:38:38]  <Motoko`kaseijin> It's a small house abutting a couple of agricultural units. An older man, probably in his late forties or early fifties, is sitting on a rocking chair on the front porch.
[05-Aug-2012 20:38:50]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Nobody else seems to be around at the moment. **
[05-Aug-2012 20:39:09]  <Rashi> [homey]
[05-Aug-2012 20:39:39]  <Gideon> ((I pictured the man with a shotgun across his lap.))
[05-Aug-2012 20:40:01]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14I thought you didn't want more gunfights.
[05-Aug-2012 20:40:44]  <Gideon> ((I really don't, but you put a small farmhouse with a rocking chair on the porch and my brain fills in details.))
[05-Aug-2012 20:41:11]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Odd details. Anyway, converse, converse!
[05-Aug-2012 20:41:31]  <Gideon> ((Surreptitious conversations?))
[05-Aug-2012 20:42:37]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Yes, Rashi and Gideon are far enough away to not be overheard, and inconspicuous enough that nobody minds them.
[05-Aug-2012 20:42:46]  * Gideon looks at the small house. It's not quite what he imagined the girls living in, but people are surprising.
[05-Aug-2012 20:43:20]  <Rashi> "Maybe they sold their land to get the clothes."
[05-Aug-2012 20:44:01]  <Gideon> "Heh. Maybe that's what Sister Abigail wanted to talk to Travis about."
[05-Aug-2012 20:44:30]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Your characters are so adorable.
[05-Aug-2012 20:45:06]  <Gideon> ((/me makes moe faces.))

[05-Aug-2012 20:47:39]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14"Gideon makes a face. 'Oh, yeah, we could do that, couldn't we...?'"
[05-Aug-2012 20:48:29]  * Gideon sighs. "That's not what I meant by surreptitious, but it doesn't look like the girls are here anyway." He gestures, "After you then."
[05-Aug-2012 20:49:59]  * Rashi :?, before groaning a bit and walking forward
[05-Aug-2012 20:50:19]  <Rashi> "Hello, sir!  Is this where Sisters Abigail and Nora live?"
[05-Aug-2012 20:50:50]  <Motoko`kaseijin> The man doesn't seem to notice you. **
[05-Aug-2012 20:51:30]  <Gideon> ((WMG: The man is dead.))
[05-Aug-2012 20:51:34]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14No.
[05-Aug-2012 20:51:39]  <Gideon> ((WMG: We're dead.))
[05-Aug-2012 20:51:40]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14No, no death. Yet.
[05-Aug-2012 20:51:51]  <Rashi> [is the chair rocking]
[05-Aug-2012 20:52:20]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Yes. He's staring off into the distance, idly chewing on a stalk of wheat. **

[05-Aug-2012 20:53:24]  * Rashi walks closer.  "Sir?"
[05-Aug-2012 20:54:36]  <Motoko`kaseijin> The man turns to look at Rashi, a look of surprise emerging on his face.
[05-Aug-2012 20:55:03]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Oh, sorry, I didn't see you. Or hear you. My ears are going a bit. Do you have some business with me, Brother?" **
[05-Aug-2012 20:55:59]  <Rashi> "Ah, we were just wondering if this is where Sisters Abigail and Nora live.  It's not exctly what we expected, given their... adornments?"

[05-Aug-2012 21:00:35]  <Rashi> "Your situation?  Something wrong?"
[05-Aug-2012 21:00:53]  <Rashi> "Or do you mean the trade route."
[05-Aug-2012 21:01:40]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Hm? Oh, I suppose there are more pressing things, so I don't want to waste your -- well... um, why don't you come inside? I'll explain it to you."

[05-Aug-2012 21:04:38]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "well, anyway, uh, my daughter, Nora, I've been getting the impression from her that she intends to leave the Faith." **

[05-Aug-2012 21:05:37]  * Rashi blinks surprisedly
[05-Aug-2012 21:06:05]  <Gideon> ((So moe))
[05-Aug-2012 21:06:50]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "I don't know. She's always been a bit... um, impatient, I'm sure you know. Lately she's been asking me lots of questions about life in cities, though.
[05-Aug-2012 21:07:34]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "I only remember bits and pieces of it, since I left when I was young. She tells me she doesn't plan on leaving the Faith when I ask her, but... you know the feeling?" **
[05-Aug-2012 21:09:11]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Brother Darren sighs. "And of course, right at the exact moment when she seems to be wavering, the outsiders come for a visit. Nora seems almost fascinated by them." **
[05-Aug-2012 21:09:57]  <Rashi> "That is a problem."
[05-Aug-2012 21:10:14]  <Rashi> "What about Sister Abigail?  She seems much more spirited."
[05-Aug-2012 21:10:57]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "What about her?" **
[05-Aug-2012 21:11:12]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Darren's not exactly quick on the uptake, in case you haven't noticed...
[05-Aug-2012 21:12:26]  <Rashi> "I mean, is she fascinated?  Wavering?"
[05-Aug-2012 21:13:21]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Oh, no, no. Not at all." **
[05-Aug-2012 21:14:41]  <Gideon> "If you don't mind my asking Brother, where is there mother?"
[05-Aug-2012 21:16:04]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Oh, yes. She passed on. Several years ago." **
[05-Aug-2012 21:17:49]  <Gideon> "I see." Gideon understands the loss of a mother, but for a pair of girls it would have been much worse. No one around to teach you your place in the Faith or to guide you. No wonder Sister Nora was faltering.
[05-Aug-2012 21:18:50]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Do -- do you think there's something you can do for my daughter?" **
[05-Aug-2012 21:22:32]  <Gideon> "It would be a shame for him to lose his daughter too," Gideon whispers to Rashi, hoping Darren's ears are really that bad.
[05-Aug-2012 21:23:12]  <Motoko`kaseijin> They really are. **
[05-Aug-2012 21:23:18]  <Rashi> "Yes... what a heartless girl she would have to be."
[05-Aug-2012 21:24:34]  <Gideon> "We can talk to her; try to steer her back towards the King's Path," Gideon says to Brother Darren.
[05-Aug-2012 21:25:36]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Do you think that... that'll work? I know I've tried, but... maybe I'm just no good at this..." **
[05-Aug-2012 21:27:59]  <Rashi> "It's our duty." [Yes, we, the haranguers, will never give up on this sacred task]
[05-Aug-2012 21:28:11]  <Gideon> ((I'll pray for you.))

[05-Aug-2012 21:31:03]  <Motoko`kaseijin> The sound of footsteps echoes from the front door just as Darren finishes speaking, and Abigail walks in.
[05-Aug-2012 21:31:46]  <Motoko`kaseijin> She looks with mild surprise at Rashi and Gideon, then cleans up her expression and greets them. "Hello, brothers."
[05-Aug-2012 21:32:09]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "There you are, Abigail," Darren says. "What kept you?"

[05-Aug-2012 21:33:00]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "I was just catching up with Brother Travis," she responds, a bit louder than would usually be necessary. "Just idle chatter."
[05-Aug-2012 21:33:18]  <Motoko`kaseijin> She walks out through the back door, apparently off to do something else. **
[05-Aug-2012 21:37:01]  <Rashi> "Busy girl."
[05-Aug-2012 21:37:46]  <Gideon> "Certainly seems so," Gideon agrees. "Does she talk to Brother Travis often?" he asks Darren.
[05-Aug-2012 21:39:30]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Ah, yes, Abigail hasn't got Nora's impatience, but she still keeps up a fast pace.
[05-Aug-2012 21:40:03]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "As for her and Brother Travis, they've been on... good terms? I don't know the details, though. They're too young for me to understand, certainly." **
[05-Aug-2012 21:40:49]  <Rashi> [wait, how old is travis?]
[05-Aug-2012 21:41:15]  <Rashi> [also, I'm confused about names here.  I thought the Steward was opposed to the trade thing, and Travis was another guy who wasn't, who we were talking to at the beginning of this session?]
[05-Aug-2012 21:42:15]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Yes, you have that right. Brother Travis is somewhere around thirty. Abigail is nineteen or twenty.
[05-Aug-2012 21:42:31]  <Motoko`kaseijin> You'll remember she interrupted the conversation you were having with him last session.
[05-Aug-2012 21:42:45]  <Rashi> [then why did you say "that was the Steward, but we can pretend" earlier?]
[05-Aug-2012 21:43:01]  <Gideon> ((The Steward gave us tea and not Travis))
[05-Aug-2012 21:43:04]  <Motoko`kaseijin> The Steward served tea. Brother Travis didn't.

[05-Aug-2012 21:44:07]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Anyway, let us press onward!
[05-Aug-2012 21:47:04]  <Gideon> "Do you know where Nora might be?"
[05-Aug-2012 21:47:57]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "I don't know, personally...
[05-Aug-2012 21:48:14]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Abigail?" Darren calls out loudly. "Do you know where Nora is?"
[05-Aug-2012 21:49:18]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Abigail pokes her head in through the door. "You mean she's not home?"
[05-Aug-2012 21:49:36]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "I haven't seen her..." Darren replies.
[05-Aug-2012 21:49:58]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Oh, she's probably off at Zeph's place again..." Abigail sighs. **

[05-Aug-2012 21:54:52]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Were you thinking of something in particular, Rashi?
[05-Aug-2012 21:56:08]  <Rashi> [hm?]
[05-Aug-2012 21:56:20]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Thank you, brothers," Darren says to Gideon. "I know these are just the problems of a small family, but I'm glad you're willing to help me all the same." **
[05-Aug-2012 21:56:38]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14With regards to Zeph not liking the trade route.
[05-Aug-2012 21:56:52]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Something about that strike you as particularly interesting?
[05-Aug-2012 21:56:58]  <Rashi> [oh, just that it sort of contrasted with nora being all sidgety]
[05-Aug-2012 21:59:15]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Oh, okay.

[05-Aug-2012 22:00:43]  <Rashi> [i'm sure the evil tyrannosaur subplot will pick up next time]
[05-Aug-2012 22:01:14]  <Gideon> Not a big deal.
[05-Aug-2012 22:01:20]  <Gideon> We at least got more story things going.

[05-Aug-2012 22:02:33]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Or at least that's how I imagine it.
[05-Aug-2012 22:02:35]  <Gideon> Heh.
[05-Aug-2012 22:02:45]  <Gideon> Well, it'll be nice to not almost die.
[05-Aug-2012 22:03:20]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Haha, of course.
[05-Aug-2012 22:03:29]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Any suspicions so far?
[05-Aug-2012 22:04:02]  <Gideon> I suspect Travis is up to something.
[05-Aug-2012 22:04:07]  <Gideon> But not something obviously malicious.
[05-Aug-2012 22:05:03]  <Rashi> refer to previous tyrannosaur-related comment
[05-Aug-2012 22:05:12]  <Motoko`kaseijin> -_-
[05-Aug-2012 22:05:36]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Iverum's on the right track, actually.
[05-Aug-2012 22:05:52]  <Motoko`kaseijin> I think now that the background's out of the way, I can dispense with some of the subtlety.
[05-Aug-2012 22:06:36]  <Motoko`kaseijin> (The book tells me "don't be too subtle" and I can only respond "but that's not in my nature!")
[05-Aug-2012 22:06:48]  <Gideon> Heh.
