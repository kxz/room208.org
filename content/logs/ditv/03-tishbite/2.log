@time=2012-08-05T21:37:01.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Busy girl."
@time=2012-08-05T21:37:46.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Certainly seems so," Gideon agrees. "Does she talk to Brother Travis often?" he asks Darren.
@time=2012-08-05T21:39:30.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Ah, yes, Abigail hasn't got Nora's impatience, but she still keeps up a fast pace.
@time=2012-08-05T21:40:03.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"As for her and Brother Travis, they've been on... good terms? I don't know the details, though. They're too young for me to understand, certainly." **
@time=2012-08-05T21:40:49.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :[wait, how old is travis?]
@time=2012-08-05T21:41:15.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :[also, I'm confused about names here.  I thought the Steward was opposed to the trade thing, and Travis was another guy who wasn't, who we were talking to at the beginning of this session?]
@time=2012-08-05T21:42:15.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes, you have that right. Brother Travis is somewhere around thirty. Abigail is nineteen or twenty.
@time=2012-08-05T21:42:31.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You'll remember she interrupted the conversation you were having with him last session.
@time=2012-08-05T21:42:45.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :[then why did you say "that was the Steward, but we can pretend" earlier?]
@time=2012-08-05T21:43:01.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :((The Steward gave us tea and not Travis))
@time=2012-08-05T21:43:04.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The Steward served tea. Brother Travis didn't.
@time=2012-08-05T21:43:13.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :((But I was stupid and misread the logs))
@time=2012-08-05T21:43:14.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :[oh.  yeah, I have no memory for tea]
@time=2012-08-05T21:44:07.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, let us press onward!
@time=2012-08-05T21:47:04.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Do you know where Nora might be?"
@time=2012-08-05T21:47:57.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I don't know, personally...
@time=2012-08-05T21:48:14.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Abigail?" Darren calls out loudly. "Do you know where Nora is?"
@time=2012-08-05T21:49:18.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Abigail pokes her head in through the door. "You mean she's not home?"
@time=2012-08-05T21:49:36.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I haven't seen her..." Darren replies.
@time=2012-08-05T21:49:58.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Oh, she's probably off at Zeph's place again..." Abigail sighs. **
@time=2012-08-05T21:50:29.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :((Zeph was the watering hole bartender thing?))
@time=2012-08-05T21:51:31.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :[zeph didn't like the trade shit.  interedasting]
@time=2012-08-05T21:51:56.000Z :Barcodexcursion NICK Barcode
@time=2012-08-05T21:52:22.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes, to both.
@time=2012-08-05T21:54:07.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We know where that is," Gideon says. "We'll go and talk to her."
@time=2012-08-05T21:54:52.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14Were you thinking of something in particular, Rashi?
@time=2012-08-05T21:56:08.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :[hm?]
@time=2012-08-05T21:56:20.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Thank you, brothers," Darren says to Gideon. "I know these are just the problems of a small family, but I'm glad you're willing to help me all the same." **
@time=2012-08-05T21:56:38.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14With regards to Zeph not liking the trade route.
@time=2012-08-05T21:56:52.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14Something about that strike you as particularly interesting?
@time=2012-08-05T21:56:58.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :[oh, just that it sort of contrasted with nora being all sidgety]
@time=2012-08-05T21:59:15.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14Oh, okay.
@time=2012-08-05T21:59:43.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14I'm getting called out of here pretty soon, so we may have to wrap up...
@time=2012-08-05T22:00:00.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14Sorry that not much of anything happened this session. >_<
@time=2012-08-05T22:00:43.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :[i'm sure the evil tyrannosaur subplot will pick up next time]
@time=2012-08-05T22:01:14.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not a big deal.
@time=2012-08-05T22:01:20.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We at least got more story things going.
@time=2012-08-05T22:02:08.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We *are* getting closer to the root cause of all this.
@time=2012-08-05T22:02:25.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't think guns will be involved, but you might have to participate in a cover-up.
@time=2012-08-05T22:02:26.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :you mean our characters are.  you're not playing, you lazy bum, don't take our credit
@time=2012-08-05T22:02:33.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or at least that's how I imagine it.
@time=2012-08-05T22:02:35.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Heh.
@time=2012-08-05T22:02:45.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, it'll be nice to not almost die.
@time=2012-08-05T22:03:20.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Haha, of course.
@time=2012-08-05T22:03:29.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Any suspicions so far?
@time=2012-08-05T22:04:02.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I suspect Travis is up to something.
@time=2012-08-05T22:04:07.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But not something obviously malicious.
@time=2012-08-05T22:05:03.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :refer to previous tyrannosaur-related comment
@time=2012-08-05T22:05:12.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :-_-
@time=2012-08-05T22:05:36.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Iverum's on the right track, actually.
@time=2012-08-05T22:05:52.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think now that the background's out of the way, I can dispense with some of the subtlety.
@time=2012-08-05T22:06:36.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(The book tells me "don't be too subtle" and I can only respond "but that's not in my nature!")
@time=2012-08-05T22:06:48.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Heh.
