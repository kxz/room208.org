[22-Jul-2012 20:27:43]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Rashi and Gideon have arrived in the conclave of Tishbite, stopping by on their way to visit an old acquaintance in the Dogs' Temple some distance away.
[22-Jul-2012 20:28:37]  <Motoko`kaseijin> There seem to be an unusually large number of non-Faithful in the town. From the looks of it, they're here an business of some sort.
[22-Jul-2012 20:28:41]  <Motoko`kaseijin> * on business
[22-Jul-2012 20:29:45]  <Motoko`kaseijin> One man walks up to Gideon and hands him a leaflet. "Won't you support the Regional Trade Corridor?" he asks, and then moves on. **
[22-Jul-2012 20:30:23]  * Gideon reads the pamphlet.
[22-Jul-2012 20:30:35]  * Rashi raises eyebrow
[22-Jul-2012 20:30:52]  *** Mimudakki|afk is now known as Mimudakki
[22-Jul-2012 20:34:10]  <Gideon> ((What's in the pamphlet, Motoko? Or shall I just extrapolate wildly?))
[22-Jul-2012 20:34:32]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Sorry, typing.
[22-Jul-2012 20:35:35]  <Motoko`kaseijin> The pamphlet has a small map printed on it, showing a red line connecting the two cities nearest the Faithful territory.
[22-Jul-2012 20:36:02]  <Rashi> Two non-Faithful cities?
[22-Jul-2012 20:36:20]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Yes.
[22-Jul-2012 20:36:51]  <Motoko`kaseijin> The line runs through a short stretch of Faithful land. Rashi recognizes it as being the area near here.
[22-Jul-2012 20:37:04]  <Motoko`kaseijin> A heading on the leaflet reads "Good for Business - Good for Knowledge - Good for Survival". **
[22-Jul-2012 20:37:42]  <Gideon> "Have you ever seen this before?" Gideon asks Rashi.
[22-Jul-2012 20:37:48]  <Rashi> "Politics, oh boy..."
[22-Jul-2012 20:38:10]  <Rashi> "No, but I've seen a few land disputes back home.  It can get ugly."
[22-Jul-2012 20:38:53]  * Gideon sighs and leafs through the pamphlet again, looking for a name to tie the movement to.
[22-Jul-2012 20:39:14]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Walking onward, Gideon and Rashi notice a man beckoning them into a small out-of-the-way building.
[22-Jul-2012 20:39:47]  <Motoko`kaseijin> It turns out to be a small watering hole-type establishment that serves drinks (non-alcoholic, of course) and some provisions.
[22-Jul-2012 20:40:25]  <Motoko`kaseijin> The man steps back behind the counter and greets the Dogs. "Hello, brothers. It's good to see some new Faithful faces around here."
[22-Jul-2012 20:40:42]  <Motoko`kaseijin> There are a couple of other people hanging around, locals by the looks of it. **
[22-Jul-2012 20:41:49]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Gideon: There are no names listed, unfortunately, just a line at the bottom reading "Regional Trade Corridor Enactment Committee". **
[22-Jul-2012 20:42:23]  * Gideon nods to the man and returns his greeting. "Good to see a friendly face. It seems like the non-Faithful are rather interested in this place," he says, holding up the pamphlet with a smile.
[22-Jul-2012 20:44:06]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Ah, yes, it's been quite hectic today. You know city folk -- they're always like they think they're going to be left behind. It's not the first time they've been here, either."
[22-Jul-2012 20:45:21]  <Motoko`kaseijin> The man wipes his brow with a damp towel. "Most of us are flat-out opposed to the idea, of course. The Territorial Authority gave us this land, and we're not happy with these folk just taking it back.
[22-Jul-2012 20:46:27]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Oh, by the way, I'm Zeph. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Take a look around, see if there's anything you'd like." **
[22-Jul-2012 20:47:56]  * Gideon shoves the pamphlet in his coat's pocket and leans up against the counter. He takes his time surveying the crowd in the little place.
[22-Jul-2012 20:49:32]  <Rashi> [timed it wrong.  back in an hour or so.  sorry.  -_-]
[22-Jul-2012 20:49:40]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Two men sit off in the corner, engaged in what seems like a very deep conversation. A mother and child are at another table. None of them seem to care much about your presence.
[22-Jul-2012 20:50:45]  <Motoko`kaseijin> However, there's also a girl who's been watching Brother Zeph and the Dogs for a while, and doesn't seem to care if she's noticed. **

[22-Jul-2012 21:58:38]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Hello," the girl says, not really seeming to care about what Rashi actually said. "Who are you?" **
[22-Jul-2012 21:59:41]  <Rashi> "A Dog.  Do you need something?"

[22-Jul-2012 22:03:01]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Brother Zeph speaks up. "Oh, that's Sister Nora. Forgive her attitude. She's always been a bit... impetuous, you could say." **
[22-Jul-2012 22:06:57]  <Gideon> "I see," Gideon says. "Other than the trade corridor business has anything else been going on in the area?"
[22-Jul-2012 22:07:30]  <Rashi> "Oh, I see..." Rashi lies.  He's never really seen a remotely rich person before.  "Say, Brother Zeph, do you happen to have orange juice?  I'm as thirsty as a horse."
[22-Jul-2012 22:08:32]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Nothing particularly, no," Zeph says to Gideon. Just as he's pulling out a glass for Rashi to drink from, a young woman comes rushing through the door.
[22-Jul-2012 22:09:38]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Nora, there you are! Father and I have been looking all over for you!" she says, her voice weary.
[22-Jul-2012 22:10:30]  <Motoko`kaseijin> She pulls on Nora's arm and drags her out of the shop. It's hard not to notice that she, too, seems to look like she's of unusual means.
[22-Jul-2012 22:10:55]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Oh, Sister Abigail, say hello to your father for me!" Brother Zeph shouts as the two girls leave. **

[22-Jul-2012 22:12:26]  <Gideon> "Interesting people," Gideon mutters to himself. He's not used to people wearing fancy clothes. His mother only had one nice dress and she wore that only to services.
[22-Jul-2012 22:12:35]  <Rashi> "Ah, thank you.  So... what's the story with them?  Sisters, I assume?"
[22-Jul-2012 22:15:02]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Ah, yeah," Zeph says. "They've always kind of stood out a little bit. The clothes are a new thing, though. I didn't think they were that well-off. Never asked, though." **
[22-Jul-2012 22:15:50]  <Gideon> "How new?"
[22-Jul-2012 22:17:02]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Zeph laughs. "I'm getting on in years, so don't take my word for it, but this is the first time I've noticed. Could have something to do with the trade route folks." **
[22-Jul-2012 22:19:47]  <Gideon> "You said that most people were opposed to them though. I'm guessing that there are a few Faithful that could do with the money though?"
[22-Jul-2012 22:24:55]  <Rashi> "It might be more complicated than just money.  Land causes strong emotions in some people..."
[22-Jul-2012 22:25:57]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Hm... I suppose that might be true. Sister Abigail's family has never really stuck their necks out one way or the other, though. If you want to know who the biggest supporter's been, it's Brother Travis. He's, uh, what do you say, a bit of an upstart. Seems to be good with business. I think he sees lots of opportunity here..." **
[22-Jul-2012 22:28:54]  <Gideon> Gideon frowns. The Faith was supposed to provide all the opportunity one needed. To side with people from outside of the Faith and hand over land to them was... wrong.
[22-Jul-2012 22:31:29]  <Gideon> "What do you think about this, Rashi?"
[22-Jul-2012 22:32:21]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Zeph notices Gideon's expression. "I have the same gut feeling, too. But I can't simply condemn him. He does right by his family, and he's always helped this town out when it needs a hand." **
[22-Jul-2012 22:33:47]  <Rashi> "I suppose we don't know the whole situation yet..." Rashi frowns as well.
[22-Jul-2012 22:33:55]  <Rashi> "Are those people here just to hand out pamphlets? The... outsiders."
[22-Jul-2012 22:36:53]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "No, I think they're meeting with... well, they called them 'stakeholders.' In the plan, I mean. Of course, that includes Steward Lee, but also Brother Travis, and maybe a couple of other people. I don't know why they're handing those things out to us when we don't make the choices here, but I suppose it's a city thing." **
[22-Jul-2012 22:38:42]  <Gideon> "When is the meeting?"
[22-Jul-2012 22:40:06]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Ah, no, it's not a meeting like that. They're talking with them one on one, it looks like. I'm not privy to the details. What can I say? In the end, I have to trust the Steward's judgment." **
[22-Jul-2012 22:42:31]  <Gideon> "Oh," Gideon sighs. Zeph is right. The Steward knows what is best for his congregation. Of course, it is the Dogs' job to know what is best for the steward. "We should probably talk to the Steward," he says.
[22-Jul-2012 22:43:01]  <Rashi> "Good idea."
[22-Jul-2012 22:45:45]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Ah, of course. Here." Brother Zeph draws a map. "You'll find his house over here. His name's on the door. Can't miss it.
[22-Jul-2012 22:46:30]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Oh, and don't worry about payment for the refreshments, my friend." He looks at Rashi. "You're doing the King's work, after all."
[22-Jul-2012 22:47:24]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Fast-forward some minutes, to Gideon and Rashi showing up on the Steward's doorstep. It appears to be a quiet household. **
[22-Jul-2012 22:47:25]  <Rashi> "Thank you, Brother."
[22-Jul-2012 22:49:21]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14Actually, let's say...
[22-Jul-2012 22:50:54]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Gideon knocks on the door. A middle-aged man comes to greet them. "Oh, hello, my brothers. Come on in." He beckons Gideon and Rashi to a table inside. A younger woman, probably his wife, sets a few cups of tea down on the table.
[22-Jul-2012 22:51:08]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "So, what brings you here today?" Brother Lee asks. **
[22-Jul-2012 22:51:50]  <Gideon> Gideon pulls the pamphlet from his coat's pocket and sets it down on the table. "We were curious about your feelings on this, Steward."
[22-Jul-2012 22:53:57]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Ah, yes, of course. Well, as you might expect, I'm opposed. I've been here since this town was founded, exactly to get away from this sort of thing. No man will persuade me otherwise." **
[22-Jul-2012 22:54:35]  * Rashi relaxes a bit.  He didn't like the idea that he'd have to argue with a Steward.
[22-Jul-2012 22:55:13]  <Gideon> "I'm happy to hear that."
[22-Jul-2012 22:56:10]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Lee nods. "I'm sure you know there are others here who aren't, though." **
[22-Jul-2012 22:57:13]  <Gideon> "Brother Travis?" Gideon says, "Yes, we heard that he may not be opposed to the plan."

[22-Jul-2012 23:14:59]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Lee knocks on the door. A man in his early thirties comes to greet him. "Hello, Steward," he says in a gentle voice. "How can I help you?"
[22-Jul-2012 23:16:13]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Some traveling servants of the Faith have asked after you," Lee says, gesturing at the two men behind him.

[22-Jul-2012 23:21:34]  <Gideon> "Brother Travis, we've been looking into the trade route that's been proposed," Gideon begins. "We've been told that you're a supporter of it."
[22-Jul-2012 23:23:06]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Indeed I am. I would be lying if I were to say I didn't have a personal stake in this matter, but I truly believe allowing this trade route to pass near this town would be for the best." **
[22-Jul-2012 23:24:19]  <Gideon> "Why is that, Brother?"
[22-Jul-2012 23:26:23]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Well, as loath as I am to admit it, we're dependent on resources provided by those outside of the Faith, and there's no reason to make them harder to get than they need to be.

[22-Jul-2012 23:31:03]  <Gideon> "I don't believe you have the whole story there," Gideon says, glancing at Rashi. "However, a better supply chain may have prevented some problems at Fowler Ridge, that is true."

[22-Jul-2012 23:32:37]  <Gideon> "What does this town need that the Faith cannot provide?"
[22-Jul-2012 23:33:41]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Of course, I don't believe that we should forget the value of the work we do here in the wilderness, and simply be dependent on others to provide for us, but at the same time, seeing that happen convinced me that neither should Faithful men, women, and children be allowed to starve.
[22-Jul-2012 23:35:10]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "I don't consider this working against the intents of the Faith, or of the King of Life. I believe this is his way of ensuring our security. We can reinvest the additional profits from our trade with the nearby cities into the town, perhaps even the entire region." **
[22-Jul-2012 23:36:51]  * Gideon looks at Rashi. Travis is making sense. If the town can benefit from trade and it isn't out of selfish reasons that Travis supports it then maybe this is good for the Faith. "What do you think, Brother Rashi?"
[22-Jul-2012 23:38:22]  <Rashi> "Is there anything actually in the area being traded?"
[22-Jul-2012 23:38:56]  <Rashi> Travis's testimony is enough to make Rashi think the trade route isn't as problematic as he'd assumed, and that maybe the Dogs shouldn't butt in.

[22-Jul-2012 23:41:02]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Travis is interrupted by a knock at the door.
[22-Jul-2012 23:41:24]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Excuse me," he says, and gets up to answer.
[22-Jul-2012 23:42:56]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Travis has a short conversation with someone outside. Though any view outside is blocked Travis' figure in the doorway, the voice unmistakably belongs to Sister Abigail, from earlier.
[22-Jul-2012 23:43:20]  <Rashi> [er, from the ridge?]
[22-Jul-2012 23:43:33]  <Motoko`kaseijin> 14From the café-thing.

[22-Jul-2012 23:45:23]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Most of the words are unintelligible, but Travis can be heard saying "I have guests over now, but perhaps later will do?"
[22-Jul-2012 23:46:29]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "There won't be [???] here then?" Abigail responds.
[22-Jul-2012 23:46:55]  <Motoko`kaseijin> "Yes, I can assure you that. Until then?"
[22-Jul-2012 23:47:35]  <Motoko`kaseijin> Travis walks back over to the table where Rashi and Gideon are seated, and says, "Sorry about that. What were we talking about again...?"
[22-Jul-2012 23:47:46]  <Motoko`kaseijin> And break until Rashi returns.
