[20-May-2012 22:14:57]  <Nitya> I hope my character overcame his fear of violence?
[20-May-2012 22:16:20]  <Motoko> Aha, that works. Especially given that the job can be fairly prickly.
[20-May-2012 22:18:22]  <Motoko> So you're going to take the side of Rashi still in fear of violence, and I'll be some pressure for you to change.
[20-May-2012 22:18:28]  <Motoko> Where do you want to conflict to take place?
[20-May-2012 22:18:55]  <Nitya> Um.  I don't know.
[20-May-2012 22:20:14]  <Motoko> Just a general setting, nothing too specific.
[20-May-2012 22:20:30]  <Nitya> Wilderness?
[20-May-2012 22:20:41]  <Motoko> Presumably Rashi is confronted with some incident he can't ignore.
[20-May-2012 22:21:43]  <Motoko> Okay, let's say you're out in the Martian wandering lands and... what's happened?
[20-May-2012 22:21:52]  <Nitya> Animal?
[20-May-2012 22:22:28]  <Motoko> You've got to give me more than one word to work with here. :p
[20-May-2012 22:22:40]  <Nitya> "large"
[20-May-2012 22:22:42]  <Nitya> "dangerous"
[20-May-2012 22:23:42]  <Motoko> What's the animal done, or doing, such that violence is necessitated?
[20-May-2012 22:24:20]  <Nitya> Feeding on a dead (human) body?  (desecrating it)
[20-May-2012 22:25:06]  <Motoko> Ah, okay. So the conflict is between your distaste for violence and your desire not to see the body violated.
[20-May-2012 22:27:00]  <Motoko> Let's see... I think we can play this with you taking the former side if your mind, and me taking the latter, unless you want someone other character present to serve that purpose.
[20-May-2012 22:27:06]  <Motoko> * former side of your mind
[20-May-2012 22:27:43]  <Nitya> Nah, that sounds good.
[20-May-2012 22:28:15]  <Motoko> Okay, I'll raise first. Combat rules are on page 54 onward.
[20-May-2012 22:29:35]  <Motoko> Presumably you'll be fighting off the animal armed, so let's say you roll Acuity and Will (7d6)
[20-May-2012 22:29:56]  <Nitya> Okay... then what?
[20-May-2012 22:30:03]  <Motoko> And I'll roll 4d6 and 4d10 for my dice.
[20-May-2012 22:30:06]  <Motoko> !roll 4d6
[20-May-2012 22:30:06]  <GameServ> 6, 1, 3, 4 == 14
[20-May-2012 22:30:08]  <Motoko> !roll 4d10
[20-May-2012 22:30:08]  <GameServ> 7, 3, 3, 3 == 16
[20-May-2012 22:30:23]  <Motoko> I have 1 3 3 3 3 4 6 7 available to me.
[20-May-2012 22:30:30]  <Nitya> And I roll 7d6?
[20-May-2012 22:30:35]  <Motoko> Right.
[20-May-2012 22:30:40]  <Nitya> !roll 7d6
[20-May-2012 22:30:40]  <GameServ> 4, 6, 6, 2, 1, 3, 6 == 28
[20-May-2012 22:31:13]  <Motoko> You can add dice for any traits, relationships, or belongings you think are relevant if you wish.
[20-May-2012 22:31:32]  <Motoko> Right now you have 1 2 3 4 6 6 6.
[20-May-2012 22:31:47]  <Nitya> ah, probably the gun.
[20-May-2012 22:31:57]  <Nitya> !roll d4+d6
[20-May-2012 22:31:57]  <GameServ> 1 == 1
[20-May-2012 22:32:00]  <Nitya> er.
[20-May-2012 22:32:03]  <Nitya> !roll d4
[20-May-2012 22:32:03]  <GameServ> 2 == 2
[20-May-2012 22:32:05]  <Nitya> !roll d6
[20-May-2012 22:32:05]  <GameServ> 6 == 6
[20-May-2012 22:32:13]  <Motoko> 1 2 2 3 4 6 6 6 6, then.
[20-May-2012 22:33:30]  <Nitya> So you said you were raising first?
[20-May-2012 22:33:43]  <Motoko> Yup. Typing now.
[20-May-2012 22:35:39]  <Motoko> Rashi notices the beast feeding on a dead body somewhere in the distance. He recognizes the face as someone he met passing through a nearby village. Being able to match the face to a person disturbs him greatly, and he feels impelled to do something to save the body. Raise 3 4; leave 1 3 3 3 6 7.
[20-May-2012 22:37:01]  *** Barcode is now known as Barcode[WoT]
[20-May-2012 22:37:56]  <Nitya> Hm... he yells and waves his hands at the beast to try to scare it off.  Raise 6 1, leave 2234666.
[20-May-2012 22:37:59]  <Nitya> Er, see.
[20-May-2012 22:38:16]  <Nitya> I'm not 100% on translating this "blow" stuff into this abstract.
[20-May-2012 22:38:55]  <Motoko> Basically, you try to somehow rebuff the actions in the raise with what you do in the see.
[20-May-2012 22:39:47]  <Motoko> So in this case you'd want to find some mental resistance to taking violent action.
[20-May-2012 22:40:11]  <Motoko> What you just did would probably be more suitable as a raise, since that's a new "line" of conflict.
[20-May-2012 22:40:35]  <Nitya> Oh, um... he reassures himself that the spirit has already left the body, so the body isn't that important?
[20-May-2012 22:41:11]  <Motoko> Okay, that works.
[20-May-2012 22:41:17]  <Motoko> Same dice?
[20-May-2012 22:41:20]  <Nitya> Yeah.
[20-May-2012 22:42:06]  <Motoko> Okay, now it's your turn to raise. You can do what you did earlier, or you can pick some other action that expresses your reluctance. You have to pick different dice, of course.
[20-May-2012 22:43:57]  <Nitya> Ahm... raise 6 2 (23466), make sure the gun's safety is on?
[20-May-2012 22:45:27]  <Motoko> Kind of a subconscious reassurance that he won't escalate it to violence, then.
[20-May-2012 22:46:00]  <Nitya> yeah.
[20-May-2012 22:47:44]  *** Lin_Chong <Mibbit@218.186.8.231> has joined #madokamadness
[20-May-2012 22:48:39]  <Motoko> Rashi notices that the gun's safety is off, and switches it back on hurriedly. He considers leaving the scene entirely and just trying to forget about what he saw. See 3 3 3; leave 1 6 7; 3d4 fallout.
[20-May-2012 22:48:49]  <Motoko> (I saw with three dice, so he basically takes the mental "blow".)
[20-May-2012 22:50:22]  <Nitya> So... I raise again, or what.
[20-May-2012 22:50:58]  <Motoko> I raise here. Just a second...
[20-May-2012 22:54:00]  <Motoko> Just then, a passerby stumbles by, and screams at the sight of the corpse being defiled. He notices that Rashi is armed, and implores him to do something. "Please, you can't just let Mahrer's body lie there like that!" Raise 6 7; leave 1.
[20-May-2012 22:57:36]  <Nitya> Rashi is pushed into doing something, and fires his gun into the air to try to spook the beast away.  See 6 3 4, leave 6 2, 3d4 fallout.
[20-May-2012 22:57:39]  <Nitya> How's that
[20-May-2012 22:58:56]  *** Barcode[WoT] is now known as Barcode
[20-May-2012 23:00:07]  <Motoko> Good, good. Your turn to raise.
[20-May-2012 23:01:25]  <Nitya> Uh... he follows it up by yelling, flapping his arms, etc.  Raise 6 2, leave jack-all.
[20-May-2012 23:02:22]  <Motoko> Okay, I can't see anything, so I'll say that your gunshot manages to scare the beast off, without actually resorting to violence. Give from me here.
[20-May-2012 23:03:23]  <Nitya> huh?
[20-May-2012 23:04:37]  <Motoko> I have 1 left, so I can't see, and I don't want to escalate the conflict further (like into fistfights with a bear), so I surrender the conflict.
[20-May-2012 23:04:48]  *** Barcode is now known as DawnofBarcode
[20-May-2012 23:04:54]  <Nitya> So... we're done.
[20-May-2012 23:05:03]  <Motoko> (The rulebook calls it a "give.")
[20-May-2012 23:05:08]  <Nitya> as amusing as bear fistfights would be.
[20-May-2012 23:05:33]  <Motoko> Yeah. You get a new d6 trait based on the results of this conflict. It can be something like "I'm [still] not used to violence d6", or you can spin it in a different way if you'd like (e.g. "Can scare off wildlife without resorting to guns d6")
[20-May-2012 23:06:20]  <Motoko> You also took 3d4 fallout, so if you could roll that now...
[20-May-2012 23:09:01]  <Nitya> !roll 3d4
[20-May-2012 23:09:01]  <GameServ> 3, 3, 1 == 7
[20-May-2012 23:09:48]  <Motoko> Okay, that's less than 8, so you only get short-term consequences. Your options are listed at the top of page 65.
[20-May-2012 23:11:19]  <Motoko> In summary: -1 from a stat for the next conflict, new d4 trait related to the conflict, or relationship to d4 for next conflict. (There's another option to have the character spend some time alone, but that doesn't really make sense in initiation.)
[20-May-2012 23:11:46]  <Nitya> -1 Heart
[20-May-2012 23:12:36]  <Motoko> All right. And the new d6 trait?
[20-May-2012 23:13:28]  <Nitya> gunshy.
[20-May-2012 23:13:47]  <Nitya> awkward with it, doesn't handle the recoil well, that sort of thing.
[20-May-2012 23:13:50]  <Motoko> Awesome.
[20-May-2012 23:14:13]  <Motoko> That's everything for today. Congratulations, Rashi is now an initiate.
