@time=2012-05-20T22:14:57.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I hope my character overcame his fear of violence?
@time=2012-05-20T22:16:20.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Aha, that works. Especially given that the job can be fairly prickly.
@time=2012-05-20T22:18:22.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So you're going to take the side of Rashi still in fear of violence, and I'll be some pressure for you to change.
@time=2012-05-20T22:18:28.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Where do you want to conflict to take place?
@time=2012-05-20T22:18:55.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Um.  I don't know.
@time=2012-05-20T22:20:14.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just a general setting, nothing too specific.
@time=2012-05-20T22:20:30.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Wilderness?
@time=2012-05-20T22:20:41.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Presumably Rashi is confronted with some incident he can't ignore.
@time=2012-05-20T22:21:43.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, let's say you're out in the Martian wandering lands and... what's happened?
@time=2012-05-20T22:21:52.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Animal?
@time=2012-05-20T22:22:28.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You've got to give me more than one word to work with here. :p
@time=2012-05-20T22:22:40.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"large"
@time=2012-05-20T22:22:42.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"dangerous"
@time=2012-05-20T22:23:42.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What's the animal done, or doing, such that violence is necessitated?
@time=2012-05-20T22:24:20.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Feeding on a dead (human) body?  (desecrating it)
@time=2012-05-20T22:25:06.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ah, okay. So the conflict is between your distaste for violence and your desire not to see the body violated.
@time=2012-05-20T22:27:00.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let's see... I think we can play this with you taking the former side if your mind, and me taking the latter, unless you want someone other character present to serve that purpose.
@time=2012-05-20T22:27:06.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :* former side of your mind
@time=2012-05-20T22:27:43.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Nah, that sounds good.
@time=2012-05-20T22:28:15.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, I'll raise first. Combat rules are on page 54 onward.
@time=2012-05-20T22:29:35.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Presumably you'll be fighting off the animal armed, so let's say you roll Acuity and Will (7d6)
@time=2012-05-20T22:29:56.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay... then what?
@time=2012-05-20T22:30:03.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And I'll roll 4d6 and 4d10 for my dice.

@time=2012-05-20T22:33:43.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yup. Typing now.
@time=2012-05-20T22:35:39.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rashi notices the beast feeding on a dead body somewhere in the distance. He recognizes the face as someone he met passing through a nearby village. Being able to match the face to a person disturbs him greatly, and he feels impelled to do something to save the body. Raise 3 4; leave 1 3 3 3 6 7.
@time=2012-05-20T22:37:01.000Z :Barcode NICK Barcode[WoT]
@time=2012-05-20T22:37:56.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hm... he yells and waves his hands at the beast to try to scare it off.  Raise 6 1, leave 2234666.
@time=2012-05-20T22:37:59.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Er, see.
@time=2012-05-20T22:38:16.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm not 100% on translating this "blow" stuff into this abstract.
@time=2012-05-20T22:38:55.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Basically, you try to somehow rebuff the actions in the raise with what you do in the see.
@time=2012-05-20T22:39:47.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So in this case you'd want to find some mental resistance to taking violent action.
@time=2012-05-20T22:40:11.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What you just did would probably be more suitable as a raise, since that's a new "line" of conflict.
@time=2012-05-20T22:40:35.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, um... he reassures himself that the spirit has already left the body, so the body isn't that important?
@time=2012-05-20T22:41:11.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, that works.
@time=2012-05-20T22:41:17.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Same dice?
@time=2012-05-20T22:41:20.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.
@time=2012-05-20T22:42:06.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, now it's your turn to raise. You can do what you did earlier, or you can pick some other action that expresses your reluctance. You have to pick different dice, of course.
@time=2012-05-20T22:43:57.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ahm... raise 6 2 (23466), make sure the gun's safety is on?
@time=2012-05-20T22:45:27.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kind of a subconscious reassurance that he won't escalate it to violence, then.
@time=2012-05-20T22:46:00.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah.
@time=2012-05-20T22:47:44.000Z :Lin_Chong JOIN #madokamadness
@time=2012-05-20T22:48:39.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rashi notices that the gun's safety is off, and switches it back on hurriedly. He considers leaving the scene entirely and just trying to forget about what he saw. See 3 3 3; leave 1 6 7; 3d4 fallout.
@time=2012-05-20T22:48:49.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(I saw with three dice, so he basically takes the mental "blow".)
@time=2012-05-20T22:50:22.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So... I raise again, or what.
@time=2012-05-20T22:50:58.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I raise here. Just a second...
@time=2012-05-20T22:54:00.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just then, a passerby stumbles by, and screams at the sight of the corpse being defiled. He notices that Rashi is armed, and implores him to do something. "Please, you can't just let Mahrer's body lie there like that!" Raise 6 7; leave 1.
@time=2012-05-20T22:57:36.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rashi is pushed into doing something, and fires his gun into the air to try to spook the beast away.  See 6 3 4, leave 6 2, 3d4 fallout.
@time=2012-05-20T22:57:39.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How's that
@time=2012-05-20T22:58:56.000Z :Barcode[WoT] NICK Barcode
@time=2012-05-20T23:00:07.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Good, good. Your turn to raise.
@time=2012-05-20T23:01:25.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Uh... he follows it up by yelling, flapping his arms, etc.  Raise 6 2, leave jack-all.
@time=2012-05-20T23:02:22.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, I can't see anything, so I'll say that your gunshot manages to scare the beast off, without actually resorting to violence. Give from me here.
@time=2012-05-20T23:03:23.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :huh?
@time=2012-05-20T23:04:37.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I have 1 left, so I can't see, and I don't want to escalate the conflict further (like into fistfights with a bear), so I surrender the conflict.

@time=2012-05-20T23:04:54.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So... we're done.
@time=2012-05-20T23:05:03.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(The rulebook calls it a "give.")
@time=2012-05-20T23:05:08.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :as amusing as bear fistfights would be.
@time=2012-05-20T23:05:33.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah. You get a new d6 trait based on the results of this conflict. It can be something like "I'm [still] not used to violence d6", or you can spin it in a different way if you'd like (e.g. "Can scare off wildlife without resorting to guns d6")
@time=2012-05-20T23:06:20.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You also took 3d4 fallout, so if you could roll that now...
@time=2012-05-20T23:09:01.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :!roll 3d4
@time=2012-05-20T23:09:01.000Z :GameServ PRIVMSG #madokamadness :3, 3, 1 == 7
@time=2012-05-20T23:09:48.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, that's less than 8, so you only get short-term consequences. Your options are listed at the top of page 65.
@time=2012-05-20T23:11:19.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In summary: -1 from a stat for the next conflict, new d4 trait related to the conflict, or relationship to d4 for next conflict. (There's another option to have the character spend some time alone, but that doesn't really make sense in initiation.)

@time=2012-05-20T23:12:36.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right. And the new d6 trait?
@time=2012-05-20T23:13:28.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :gunshy.
@time=2012-05-20T23:13:47.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :awkward with it, doesn't handle the recoil well, that sort of thing.
@time=2012-05-20T23:13:50.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Awesome.
@time=2012-05-20T23:14:13.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's everything for today. Congratulations, Rashi is now an initiate.
