@time=2012-05-19T21:18:46.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :This would be in a Faith school, then?
@time=2012-05-19T21:19:13.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, it would be during his training at the Dogs' Temple or whatever.
@time=2012-05-19T21:19:35.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, right. Sorry, brain's not quite there.

@time=2012-05-19T21:22:06.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We could play this as demonic influence trying to lead you astray?
@time=2012-05-19T21:22:44.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno. I think nerves would be more likely at the time, but demonic influence could be better if I fail.

@time=2012-05-19T21:26:01.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The Dogs-in-training are demonstrating their knowledge of the Faith by giving sermons on aspects in their own life. We're in one of the bigger rooms in the Temple with a few of the older Dogs. There is a pulpit near the front where the current speaker must stand while they deliver their sermon.
@time=2012-05-19T21:27:03.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So you're there in front of the room, with the other trainees and the old hands watching you.

@time=2012-05-19T22:21:30.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The first one is kind of tempering to Gideon's character, but the latter is more "vengeful" and such.
