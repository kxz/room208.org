[09-Jun-2012 20:23:06]  <Motoko`katarite> You're headed to the town of Fowler Ridge, population censuses-are-hard-on-Mars.
[09-Jun-2012 20:23:55]  <Motoko`katarite> There's been some sort of dust-up over farming, though your handlers at the Temple weren't able to give you too many details.
[09-Jun-2012 20:25:19]  <Rashi> farming, huh.
[09-Jun-2012 20:25:29]  <Motoko`katarite> As you enter the town, you notice that an argument's broken out in front of a general store.
[09-Jun-2012 20:26:57]  <Motoko`katarite> "I know Brother E. He's a good man, but it's not his position to decide who gets what!"
[09-Jun-2012 20:28:01]  <Motoko`katarite> "Joseph, please. You have to at least let him try to do his job first."
[09-Jun-2012 20:28:54]  <Gideon> Gideon steers towards the argument without a second thought, eager to exercise his new powers as a Dog. Inexperience and nervousness prevents him from jumping directly into the argument though.
[09-Jun-2012 20:28:55]  <Motoko`katarite> The handful of people involved notice you approaching, though, and fall silent.
[09-Jun-2012 20:29:20]  <Rashi> Rashi follows less confidently behind Gideon.
[09-Jun-2012 20:29:49]  <Gideon> (I'd assume we'd be easily recognizable as Dogs, correct?)
[09-Jun-2012 20:29:50]  <Motoko`katarite> Brother Joseph speaks first. "Good afternoon. What brings the Dogs of the Temple here today?"
[09-Jun-2012 20:30:00]  <Gideon> (Take that as a yes.)
[09-Jun-2012 20:31:07]  <Motoko`katarite> 14I'm going to use ** to indicate when I'm done with narration from now on.
[09-Jun-2012 20:31:28]  <Gideon> (Okay.)
[09-Jun-2012 20:31:36]  <Rashi> (Whatever you say, bossman.)
[09-Jun-2012 20:33:06]  <Motoko`katarite> Oh, **
[09-Jun-2012 20:33:12]  <Motoko`katarite> Go ahead.
[09-Jun-2012 20:34:03]  <Gideon> Gideon surveys the small assembly and smiles at Brother Joseph. "We've been assigned this congregation on our route. Anything we can help with here?"
[09-Jun-2012 20:34:47]  <Motoko`katarite> "Ah, yes, well, we've got a little crisis brewing here."
[09-Jun-2012 20:35:03]  <Motoko`katarite> Brother Joseph looks at Rashi.
[09-Jun-2012 20:35:26]  <Rashi> "Ah... yes?  Something to do with farming?"
[09-Jun-2012 20:35:52]  <Motoko`katarite> "Oh, you're Brother Eliezer's younger brother, aren't you?" **
[09-Jun-2012 20:36:36]  <Rashi> (what)

[09-Jun-2012 20:42:47]  <Motoko`katarite> Brother Joseph looks to speak up, but the woman he was arguing with starts responding first. It's clear he doesn't want to interrupt in the Dogs' presence.

[09-Jun-2012 20:45:07]  <Motoko`katarite> "We were expecting a shipment of agricultural equipment from the Authority, but it hasn't come for whatever reason. It's not unlikely that it was intercepted on the way here.
[09-Jun-2012 20:46:43]  <Motoko`katarite> "That means that some of the farming families here haven't been able to harvest their crops, and it looks like we're falling going to fall well short of what's needed to keep ourselves fed.
[09-Jun-2012 20:47:56]  <Motoko`katarite> "Brother Eliezer's been put in charge of distributing emergency food provisions in the meantime, but --"
[09-Jun-2012 20:48:31]  <Motoko`katarite> Brother Joseph cuts in. "He's just a go-between with the Authority! It's not his place." **

[09-Jun-2012 20:51:31]  <Motoko`katarite> "You know the city folk," the woman says. "They have their endless formalities. Brother Eliezer's been trying to get another one in, but at this rate it might be too late."

[09-Jun-2012 20:55:26]  <Gideon> Gideon nods. "Where is Brother Eliezer?" he asks the woman. Brother Joseph's anger towards Eliezer unnerves him.
[09-Jun-2012 20:56:56]  <Gideon> (Would you be opposed to splitting the party, Motoko? I was thinking maybe Rashi could look into the harvest and why it is failing while I go and talk to Eliezer.)
[09-Jun-2012 20:57:10]  <Motoko`katarite> "I don't know exactly where he is," she says, "but you could try calling at the officials' house next to the main square."
[09-Jun-2012 20:58:16]  <Motoko`katarite> Brother Joseph speaks again. "If you're going there, I want to come along. He needs to understand my situation. Our situation."
[09-Jun-2012 20:58:37]  <Motoko`katarite> 14Gideon: Not particularly, I suppose.
[09-Jun-2012 20:59:18]  <Gideon> (The biggest problem would be the divided attention. Up to you, Rashi.)
[09-Jun-2012 20:59:20]  <Motoko`katarite> **
[09-Jun-2012 20:59:52]  <Rashi> (Sounds like a plan.)
[09-Jun-2012 21:00:51]  <Gideon> Gideon looks back to Rashi. "You're far better with farming and such than I am. Perhaps you could go take a look at the the fields and their equipment and see if anything can be done?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:01:29]  <Rashi> "Good idea.  And you'll find Brother Eliezer?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:02:38]  <Gideon> "Yes. That sounds like a plan. We'll meet in the square when we've finished then." Gideon turns to Joseph. "Lead the way, Brother."
[09-Jun-2012 21:03:17]  <Motoko`katarite> Brother Joseph goes along with Gideon to the officials' house, then.
[09-Jun-2012 21:03:35]  <Motoko`katarite> Meanwhile, the woman offers to take Rashi to see the fields.

[09-Jun-2012 21:05:52]  <Motoko`katarite> Rashi: The woman introduces herself as Esther, and she walks down to one of the agricultural units necessary for any of this farming stuff to work on Mars.
[09-Jun-2012 21:07:09]  <Motoko`katarite> "Our units are fairly old," she says. "They've been here since we founded the town twenty years ago. I guess we got unlucky, because a lot of them started failing all at once."
[09-Jun-2012 21:07:52]  * Gideon makes spooky noises. Out of character of course. Otherwise Brother Joseph would probably get mad at him.
[09-Jun-2012 21:08:27]  <Motoko`katarite> She points to a series of lights on a panel on one side of the building. "You might be able to read this?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:08:37]  <Motoko`katarite> **
[09-Jun-2012 21:09:20]  <Motoko`katarite> Gideon: It's hard to keep Brother Joseph from knocking down the door of the officials' house, but you eventually get him to follow your lead quietly into the building.

[09-Jun-2012 21:12:55]  <Rashi> "Yes, this needs maintenance done immediately.  The others are like this too?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:13:27]  <Motoko`katarite> Rashi: "Yes... that's what the incoming equipment was supposed to fix." **
[09-Jun-2012 21:13:37]  <Gideon> "Brother Joseph tells me you're the liaison with the Authority. You've been put in charge of emergency food provisions as well?»
[09-Jun-2012 21:13:51]  <Gideon> *"
[09-Jun-2012 21:14:18]  <Motoko`katarite> Gideon: "Ah, yes, sir. I take it you've been informed of our current situation?" **
[09-Jun-2012 21:15:09]  <Motoko`katarite> 14Note: This is what happens when you install a bunch of similar new-build equipment all at once -- it tends to all fail at once too!
[09-Jun-2012 21:15:32]  <Rashi> (Like US bridges and roads. :D)
[09-Jun-2012 21:15:46]  <Gideon> Gideon nods at Brother Joseph. "Our brother was kind enough to give me a brief explanation. He seemed a bit unhappy with the situation however. Would you know why?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:15:56]  <Rashi> "Hm... I might be able to prop this up some, at least.  What equipment do you have?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:16:10]  <Gideon> (And thus begins Gideon's habit of talking about people who aren't Dogs like they're not there.)
[09-Jun-2012 21:17:04]  <Motoko`katarite> Rashi: "I don't know. You'd have to check with the local officials..." **
[09-Jun-2012 21:18:49]  <Rashi> "Right, back to Gideon, then."
[09-Jun-2012 21:19:06]  <Motoko`katarite> Gideon: "Yes, this is a situation where it's hard to make everyone happy, unfortunately. If the harvest does fail, we only have limited reserve provisions, and it's fallen on me to determine who receives what. The King knows I'd rather not be in this position...
[09-Jun-2012 21:19:20]  <Motoko`katarite> "... but this is what I've been asked to do." **
[09-Jun-2012 21:20:47]  <Motoko`katarite> Rashi: You and the woman return to the local officials' house right at this exact point in the conversation! **
[09-Jun-2012 21:21:08]  <Gideon> Brother Eliezer's response further confirms Gideon's idea that Joseph's problem with him is much more complex than originally presented.
[09-Jun-2012 21:21:16]  <Rashi> (Walk at lightspeed if it makes GMing easier 4d8)
[09-Jun-2012 21:21:37]  <Gideon> (Clearly splitting the party wasn't what IllFlower wanted.)

[09-Jun-2012 21:22:09]  <Motoko`katarite> 14I didn't realize how hectic it would get. >_<
[09-Jun-2012 21:22:26]  <Gideon> (We probably should have done each part separately.)
[09-Jun-2012 21:22:41]  <Motoko`katarite> "The Authority only told me that it was lost in shipment. That could mean anything."
[09-Jun-2012 21:22:42]  <Motoko`katarite> **
[09-Jun-2012 21:23:35]  <Gideon> Gideon turns to the newly entered Rashi. "Any news?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:27:18]  <Rashi> "The agricultural units aren't as bad off as I'd assumed.  I might be able to keep them working long enough for another equipment shipment to arrive, depending on what tools are already here."  Rashi's earlier nervousness is gone now that he's got the idea of working on the machinery in his head.
[09-Jun-2012 21:28:35]  <Motoko`katarite> "I take it this is your partner?" Brother Eliezer asks Gideon. **
[09-Jun-2012 21:29:38]  <Gideon> "Yes, this is Brother Rashi. He's rather talented with farming equipment. Perhaps you could point us to anything that could assist him?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:30:34]  <Gideon> (Congregations still have Stewards, right? Is Eliezer the steward for this town or just an official?)
[09-Jun-2012 21:30:50]  <Motoko`katarite> Just an official.
[09-Jun-2012 21:32:27]  <Motoko`katarite> Brother Joseph turns to look at Rashi. "You're saying you can help us?" **
[09-Jun-2012 21:34:27]  <Rashi> "Yes, I might be able to improvise some temporary fixes.  Could I talk to whoever does maintenance on the units?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:35:33]  <Motoko`katarite> The woman, silent until this point, speaks up. "He's gone." **
[09-Jun-2012 21:35:55]  <Rashi> "...gone?"  Rashi deflates a bit.
[09-Jun-2012 21:36:51]  <Gideon> Gideon frowns. It had been looking kind of simple up until this point.
[09-Jun-2012 21:36:53]  <Motoko`katarite> "He was found dead a couple of mornings ago. Shot. His body was dumped outside of town," Brother Eliezer says. **
[09-Jun-2012 21:37:23]  <Motoko`katarite> 14It's never that simple! ^_^
[09-Jun-2012 21:38:03]  <Gideon> "Has anyone been arrested or questioned about this? Are there any suspects?" Gideon is incredulous that they've failed to mention this until now.
[09-Jun-2012 21:40:35]  <Rashi> "Is... but..." Rashi's pretty speechless.
[09-Jun-2012 21:40:48]  <Motoko`katarite> "That's out of my purview," Eliezer says. "And as far as I know, there's nobody who could have had motive to do it. It's just taking this town's problem and turning it from bad to worse. But... uh, I..."
[09-Jun-2012 21:40:59]  <Motoko`katarite> He nods towards the woman, who nods back and leaves.
[09-Jun-2012 21:42:14]  <Motoko`katarite> "Brother Jules is -- was -- her cousin. You understand how this might be a sensitive topic." **
[09-Jun-2012 21:43:46]  <Gideon> Gideon doesn't respond to Eliezer. "Could you still do any good with the tools without him, Rashi?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:45:36]  <Rashi> "Ah... probably, yes..."
[09-Jun-2012 21:47:01]  <Gideon> Gideon thinks for a moment, looking between Eliezer and Rashi. "We should probably make sure people don't starve before we track down the murderer. What do you think?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:47:13]  <Motoko`katarite> "I agree. Let's make that our first priority, then," Eliezer says.
[09-Jun-2012 21:47:16]  <Motoko`katarite> **
[09-Jun-2012 21:47:49]  <Rashi> "Yes, that makes sense, but.. why would someone do that...?  And at a hard time?"
[09-Jun-2012 21:49:19]  <Motoko`katarite> "Sometimes people die and we can never find out why," Joseph says. "It's the cruelty of nature." **
[09-Jun-2012 21:51:40]  <Gideon> "Nature doesn't generally use bullets to kill a man, Brother," Gideon deadpans. "Can one of you take us to where you keep the tools? The quicker we fix your equipment the sooner we can investigate Brother Jule's death."
[09-Jun-2012 21:51:55]  <Gideon> *Jules'
[09-Jun-2012 21:53:06]  <Motoko`katarite> "Certainly." Brother Eliezer leads the way, and gives Rashi access to where the backup equipment is stored. It's not in the best of shapes, but it's better than nothing. The four of you load the equipment into a cart and head for the ag unit.
[09-Jun-2012 21:53:47]  <Motoko`katarite> Rashi opens up a service panel and takes a look. **
[09-Jun-2012 21:54:28]  <Rashi> (I don't want to resort to technobabble or anything, especially since it's not very technobabblic equipment...)
[09-Jun-2012 21:54:58]  <Barcode> 15 the others look at Rashi, quizzical of his use of the word "technobabble"

[09-Jun-2012 21:55:49]  <Motoko`katarite> 14I think we can initiate a conflict between Rashi and the machine. :D
[09-Jun-2012 21:55:58]  <Gideon> (We could)
[09-Jun-2012 21:56:08]  <Rashi> (shit yeah, I'll beat that shit with my trusty wrench)
[09-Jun-2012 21:56:47]  <Motoko`katarite> Okay, what's at stake here is whether Rashi gets the main agricultural unit in good enough condition to make it through the current harvest.
[09-Jun-2012 21:57:40]  <Motoko`katarite> I'm going to play the machine as a demonic influence opponent, since it's not really a full-fledged NPC. We've seen death here, so 5d10 + 4d6.
[09-Jun-2012 21:57:52]  <Gideon> The opening arena would be physical or talking?
[09-Jun-2012 21:58:35]  <Motoko`katarite> Let's say we're starting out physical.
[09-Jun-2012 21:58:57]  <Motoko`katarite> I don't really know how escalation to a gunfight would work here, but... uh, whatever.
[09-Jun-2012 21:59:01]  <Gideon> :D
[09-Jun-2012 21:59:01]  <Fiora> (Does this mean he's punching it to death?)
[09-Jun-2012 21:59:15]  <Motoko`katarite> Actually, I think the stats for talking would be more fitting here.

[09-Jun-2012 21:59:24]  <Barcode> [ Motoko`katarite: he screws it up badly enough that it starts flinging parts of itself at him]
[09-Jun-2012 21:59:28]  <Motoko`katarite> We can escalate it to physical when he starts hitting it with a wrench.
[09-Jun-2012 21:59:30]  <Gideon> Yeah, talking would make more sense.

[09-Jun-2012 22:01:58]  <Motoko`katarite> 12d6.

[09-Jun-2012 22:03:08]  <Gideon> I believe Rashi would raise first in this instance.
[09-Jun-2012 22:03:20]  <Gideon> Seeing as the machine is inanimate.
[09-Jun-2012 22:03:51]  <Motoko`katarite> He's also the one "picking the fight" by fixing it, so to speak.

[09-Jun-2012 22:04:59]  <Motoko`katarite> 14Hi again.
[09-Jun-2012 22:05:08]  <Alicia> Greetings.
[09-Jun-2012 22:05:27]  <Motoko`katarite> 14We're still going, but you're free to stick around.
[09-Jun-2012 22:05:43]  <Alicia> Okay, I'll keep quiet.
[09-Jun-2012 22:06:32]  <Rashi> Alright.  Raise 1+4/keep 2224555666; Rashi tries to reattach a belt that's come off its wheels.
[09-Jun-2012 22:06:54]  <Gideon> (This is going to be very silly, I think.)
[09-Jun-2012 22:09:13]  <Motoko`katarite> The belt is too loose for the mechanism. See 5. You hear a wailing sound as one of the wheels the belt was on begins to rotate faster and faster. Raise (5) 4, leave 1 1 2 2 6 6 10.
[09-Jun-2012 22:11:16]  <Motoko`katarite> 14What are you talking about, Gideon? Fixing machines is serious business.
[09-Jun-2012 22:11:44]  <Gideon> (Rashi lays hands on the machine and anoints it with The Sacred Earth.)
[09-Jun-2012 22:11:49]  <Rashi> (Er, what does (5) 4 mean)
[09-Jun-2012 22:12:26]  <Motoko`katarite> I reversed the blow by using only one die to see, so I can reuse that single die in my next raise.
[09-Jun-2012 22:12:41]  <Motoko`katarite> (page 58)
[09-Jun-2012 22:12:57]  <Rashi> (so you raised 9, ok)
[09-Jun-2012 22:12:59]  <Gideon> It's still only 9, but it prevents you from using up more dice.
[09-Jun-2012 22:13:29]  <Motoko`katarite> Essentially.
[09-Jun-2012 22:13:54]  <Motoko`katarite> It's also a disincentive against raises that are too weak.
[09-Jun-2012 22:14:30]  <Gideon> The largest die is a d10 right?
[09-Jun-2012 22:14:46]  <Motoko`katarite> Yes, I believe so.
[09-Jun-2012 22:14:55]  <Motoko`katarite> d4 d6 d8 d10, I think.
[09-Jun-2012 22:17:21]  <Rashi> See 5+5/keep 22245666, Rashi disconnects one of the wires to the wheel motor.  Raise 6+4/keep 222566, rewires a series of motors.
[09-Jun-2012 22:21:44]  <Motoko`katarite> I escalate this to a physical conflict. There's a short somewhere in the mechanism. See 10. One of the components explodes, sending debris flying outward. Raise (10) 6, leave 1 1 2 2 6.
[09-Jun-2012 22:22:16]  <Gideon> You need to roll new stat dice now, right?
[09-Jun-2012 22:22:50]  <Motoko`katarite> Rashi gets to add Body dice. The machine doesn't have separate stats, so nothing happens to it.
[09-Jun-2012 22:22:56]  <Gideon> Right.
[09-Jun-2012 22:23:11]  <Gideon> Only 2d6 for Body dice.
[09-Jun-2012 22:23:16]  <Rashi> (shit :<)
[09-Jun-2012 22:23:35]  <Motoko`katarite> 14There's no point to it other than adding the possibility of physical injury from fallout. :D
[09-Jun-2012 22:23:45]  <Gideon> Wee little Rashi.
[09-Jun-2012 22:24:23]  <Rashi> (so, I have to see the 16, but I get two more dice?)

[09-Jun-2012 22:24:26]  <Gideon> You can always Give and avoid any fallout.

[09-Jun-2012 22:24:50]  *** Barcode_ is now known as Barcode
[09-Jun-2012 22:24:53]  <Motoko`katarite> Right. The consequence of giving is that you lose the conflict, though.

[09-Jun-2012 22:25:28]  <Motoko`katarite> Granted, your dice are good enough that giving now seems premature.
[09-Jun-2012 22:25:42]  <Gideon> True. You'd only be taking 1 dice of Fallout at this point.
[09-Jun-2012 22:25:47]  <Gideon> *die
[09-Jun-2012 22:25:51]  <Motoko`katarite> Three, actually.
[09-Jun-2012 22:26:06]  <Gideon> Oh, right. It's all the ones you use to See.
[09-Jun-2012 22:26:07]  <Motoko`katarite> But to calculate actual fallout, you only use the highest two.
[09-Jun-2012 22:27:26]  *** Barcode is now known as Barcodrawing
[09-Jun-2012 22:27:29]  <Gideon> I should write a plugin so Omni can roll for Fallout and show you the list.
[09-Jun-2012 22:28:48]  <Rashi> So... see 6+4+2+2+2 works, right?
[09-Jun-2012 22:29:20]  <Motoko`katarite> Yes.
[09-Jun-2012 22:32:48]  <Motoko`katarite> You would take 5d6 fallout in that case.
[09-Jun-2012 22:34:06]  <Rashi> Okay, See 6+6+4 Rashi takes a bolt to the cheek, which starts bleeding.  Raise 2+5/keep 122, disconnects the belt mechanism completely, hopefully the rest should keep on regardless for a little while.  And... 5d6 fallout, ok
[09-Jun-2012 22:34:30]  <Motoko`katarite> Oh, since you used three dice to see, that's only 3d6.
[09-Jun-2012 22:34:39]  <Motoko`katarite> 3d6 fallout, rather.
[09-Jun-2012 22:34:39]  <Rashi> right, yes.
[09-Jun-2012 22:36:39]  <Motoko`katarite> The belt mechanism spins down completely, though with a sound that suggest it would rather not. See 6 1. An exhaust vent begins pouring smoke. Raise 2 2, leave 1.
[09-Jun-2012 22:37:54]  <Motoko`katarite> 14You can raise it to a hand-to-hand conflict and get more dice by smacking it or something.
[09-Jun-2012 22:38:43]  <Rashi> (do I need to...?)
[09-Jun-2012 22:38:49]  <Motoko`katarite> 14As it stands, you won't have enough dice to raise, and thus would have to forfeit.
[09-Jun-2012 22:38:58]  <Rashi> (oh.  shit)
[09-Jun-2012 22:39:09]  <Rashi> (how do I escalate again?)
[09-Jun-2012 22:39:19]  <Gideon> (Just say you hit the thing.)
[09-Jun-2012 22:39:22]  <Motoko`katarite> Just say you're escalating, and roll dice for the new stat.
[09-Jun-2012 22:39:33]  <Motoko`katarite> In this case, it's 2d6 Will.
[09-Jun-2012 22:40:10]  <Rashi> Ok.

[09-Jun-2012 22:40:31]  <Motoko`katarite> Eh, the machine only has 1 left anyway.
[09-Jun-2012 22:40:46]  <Gideon> Yeah, but his luck on the dice is awful.
[09-Jun-2012 22:41:08]  <Motoko`katarite> It's good enough.
[09-Jun-2012 22:41:14]  <Motoko`katarite> In that he didn't really need any. >_>
[09-Jun-2012 22:41:20]  <Gideon> True.
[09-Jun-2012 22:42:52]  <Rashi> See 2+2, Rashi forces a cutoff valve to divert the smoke.  Raise 2+1/keep 1, splices two unrelated subsystems together so they share power, to make up for that lost from the belt.
[09-Jun-2012 22:43:55]  <Motoko`katarite> The machine can't see, so it gives. The diagnostic panel lights turn from red to yellow, if not green.
[09-Jun-2012 22:44:36]  <Motoko`katarite> Congratulations, Brother Rashi. You fixed the agricultural unit, and at only a cost of 3d6 fallout!
[09-Jun-2012 22:44:53]  <Rashi> Rashi steps back from the panel.  Hs face is covered in oil and blood.
[09-Jun-2012 22:44:57]  <Gideon> Gideon coughs and attempts to wave off some of the smoke. "Here, you're bleeding." He holds out a clean rag to Rashi.
[09-Jun-2012 22:45:17]  <Gideon> *clean-ish, nothing is every really clean on Mars.
[09-Jun-2012 22:45:59]  <Rashi> "Thanks."  Rashi spits out some oil as he wipes.
[09-Jun-2012 22:46:37]  <Motoko`katarite> 14All right, once we wrap this up, I'm going to call quittin' time, since it's been two and a half hours already. We'll pick up investigating the mysterious death of Brother Jules next time.
[09-Jun-2012 22:46:48]  <Gideon> Should we roll for Fallout first?
[09-Jun-2012 22:46:56]  <Motoko`katarite> 14Do make sure to actually roll, Rashi. ;)

[09-Jun-2012 22:48:36]  <Motoko`katarite> You take two long-term effects, though.
[09-Jun-2012 22:48:44]  <Gideon> So, experience and long term.

[09-Jun-2012 22:49:39]  <Rashi> (wait, so two off the long-term list?)
[09-Jun-2012 22:49:42]  <Motoko`katarite> Yeah.
[09-Jun-2012 22:49:46]  <Gideon> Yeah, and one from experience.
[09-Jun-2012 22:50:10]  <Rashi> (where's experience?
[09-Jun-2012 22:50:13]  <Motoko`katarite> Experience?
[09-Jun-2012 22:50:26]  <Gideon> Experience fallout.
[09-Jun-2012 22:50:34]  <Motoko`katarite> Oh, he rolled a 1. Yes.
[09-Jun-2012 22:50:51]  <Gideon> The entire list in on page 82.
[09-Jun-2012 22:50:52]  <Motoko`katarite> So you get one positive trait off the experience list at the bottom of page 66.
[09-Jun-2012 22:51:20]  <Motoko`katarite> Thanks for that reminder.
[09-Jun-2012 22:51:26]  <Gideon> No problem
[09-Jun-2012 22:52:38]  <Rashi> Add a die to the irrigation trait, take "Missing teeth" for 1d4, permanently grimey Coat?
[09-Jun-2012 22:52:55]  <Motoko`katarite> I suppose this is the milieu of our game. Machines really are serious business in retro-future Martian Utah.
[09-Jun-2012 22:53:15]  <Motoko`katarite> That sounds fine to me. Gideon?
[09-Jun-2012 22:53:31]  <Gideon> Works for me.

[09-Jun-2012 22:53:55]  <Gideon> Yeah.
[09-Jun-2012 22:54:09]  <Rashi> oh, someone erased it while I said that, spooky
[09-Jun-2012 22:54:26]  <Motoko`katarite> I did, yes.
[09-Jun-2012 22:54:29]  <Gideon> Our next fight will be with a dentist.
