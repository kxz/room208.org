@time=2012-06-24T23:47:09.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Gideon calls over softly to the other side of the room. "Brother." Joseph looks up to face him, cheeks wet with tears.
@time=2012-06-24T23:48:47.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You saved my life, didn't you?" Joseph says to Gideon, his voice halfway between gratitude and disgust.

@time=2012-06-24T23:51:44.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Gideon nods, "I did." After a moment he adds, "I'm sorry about your brother."
@time=2012-06-24T23:54:09.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I brought it on myself." Joseph continues in the same tone of voice. "I gave him that gun thinking if worst came to worst, he could get a surprise shot off. Well, he did, just not on the person I expected. That bullet was for me, wasn't it?" **

@time=2012-06-24T23:55:52.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It wasn't his choice. He was possessed," Gideon says, trying to offer consolation. He wasn't good at this. "I wish it could have been ended without violence."

@time=2012-06-24T23:56:49.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Gideon isn't exactly sure if he was possessed. It certainly looked like it. Either way, he hopes it will ease Joseph's pain.
@time=2012-06-24T23:58:34.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah, but you get to thinking. Who was possessed? Both of *my* siblings. It's not a coincidence."
@time=2012-06-24T23:59:27.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He looks down. "I just don't know how I'll break the news to Constance." **
@time=2012-06-25T00:02:33.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Gideon looks at the sleeping girl. She has an array of cuts across her face just starting to heal. He'd saved her, more or less, but he couldn't have saved Thomas. "Pray with me, Brother. We can ask the King for guidance together."

@time=2012-06-25T00:04:31.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Joseph bows his head, and allows Gideon to lead him in prayer.

@time=2012-06-25T00:08:20.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"King of Kings, guides us in your mercy, for left to ourselves we cannot do your will. We ask for your wisdom in mourning for those lost and cherishing those who remain. We give ourselves to your guidance. Amen." (Bluh bluh, modifying existing prayers poorly.)
@time=2012-06-25T00:08:48.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(I've never actually been involved in a real life prayer, so I have no idea how it works other than what I've seen in movies.)

@time=2012-06-25T00:10:33.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Joseph stays silent for a while after Gideon finishes his prayer.
@time=2012-06-25T00:11:01.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Thank you," he finally says, looking in Gideon's general direction, then leaves.

@time=2012-06-25T00:13:51.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, wrapping up would be good. That was fun.
@time=2012-06-25T00:14:10.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Minus the whole Gideon getting shot and almost dying in the first town.

@time=2012-06-25T00:16:04.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, on the flip side, Gideon, you may have gained a romantic interest.

@time=2012-06-25T00:16:44.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Joseph?
@time=2012-06-25T00:17:11.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, if we're exiting town, we've got some reflection fallout to work on. Page 121.
@time=2012-06-25T00:17:43.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :catherine, obviously.  chicks dig being exorcised
@time=2012-06-25T00:17:52.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Constance.
@time=2012-06-25T00:18:07.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :c-names are c-names.
@time=2012-06-25T00:18:34.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hey, it was your idea in the first place, Rashi.
@time=2012-06-25T00:19:12.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, uh, actually, we never did find out who killed Brother Jules. Hm.
@time=2012-06-25T00:19:17.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :t(-_-)t
@time=2012-06-25T00:19:29.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We never did. I assumed it was Thomas acting on his brother's will.
@time=2012-06-25T00:19:36.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Probably Eliezer
@time=2012-06-25T00:20:24.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Are we satisfied with leaving this question unanswered (for now)?
@time=2012-06-25T00:21:06.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :sure, we can probably just asssume that demons were sawed and it's all good
@time=2012-06-25T00:21:13.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :then later we can reflect on our recklessness
@time=2012-06-25T00:21:18.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think Gideon will assume that Thomas was the murderer and that Joseph has been turned from his evil. So, yes, that's fine for now.
@time=2012-06-25T00:21:21.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :of course by then we'll be level seventy cyborgs.
@time=2012-06-25T00:21:59.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Of course, when we come back to find Joseph has become some level 21 warlock and has kidnapped the Steward and built a tower of sin....
@time=2012-06-25T00:22:21.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :that can be the endboss.  hopefully we'll have found the ancient sword of legend by that point
@time=2012-06-25T00:22:55.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We'll use the Golden Tablets and the Ancient Revolver of Smith to solve the problem.
@time=2012-06-25T00:23:14.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Poor Constance will be chained to a pillar in the center of the tower, which feeds off of her innocence. For fanservice purposes.
@time=2012-06-25T00:23:42.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, what do we need to do to wrap up the session, Motoko?
@time=2012-06-25T00:23:59.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just the reflection stuff on page 121.
@time=2012-06-25T00:24:21.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was going to take next Sunday off as an inter-town break and resume on the 8th.
@time=2012-06-25T00:24:31.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :new belonging: welding mask given in thanks, for use in repairs
@time=2012-06-25T00:24:33.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :«Is the town better than when they arrived?»
@time=2012-06-25T00:24:51.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha. It certainly is less populated, but nobody will starve.
@time=2012-06-25T00:24:54.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well they're not going to die.
@time=2012-06-25T00:24:57.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so that's good
@time=2012-06-25T00:25:21.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :They're not *going* to die. A few of them just finished up that process a little early...
@time=2012-06-25T00:25:33.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm gonna bump my relationship with Joseph up to d6.
@time=2012-06-25T00:25:52.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Incidentally, if you have any feedback about how this first town ran, I'm open to it.
@time=2012-06-25T00:26:11.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But uh... is something like a mask or other machining gear out of the question, actually
@time=2012-06-25T00:26:14.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'll try to avoid the shooty-gun conflicts next time. >_>;;
@time=2012-06-25T00:26:26.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :No, Rashi, that sounds reasonable to me.
@time=2012-06-25T00:26:34.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :aight
@time=2012-06-25T00:26:34.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Seemed a bit rushed towards the end. The shooty bit was okay. I probably shouldn't have taken the fallout that I really didn't need to.
@time=2012-06-25T00:27:27.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, I expected that I was going to finish with the town this session, so that's probably why it was rushed.
@time=2012-06-25T00:28:20.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Then again I threw in Brother Jules' murder on a lark during the first session, when I realized I didn't want to introduce another living character.
@time=2012-06-25T00:28:22.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm also gonna add 1 to Gideon's body. He's been beat up, but he'll come back ready to actually handle a fight.
@time=2012-06-25T00:28:41.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I did like that we actually threw you by giving on that first conflict.
@time=2012-06-25T00:28:47.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's nice to surprise the GM.
@time=2012-06-25T00:29:12.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Obviously we should give off more often
@time=2012-06-25T00:29:15.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Actually, instead of the body +1 I'm gonna take a trait.
@time=2012-06-25T00:29:15.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :*give up
@time=2012-06-25T00:29:48.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I have tangled with demons and won. 1d6

@time=2012-06-25T00:29:58.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Either one works, Gideon.
@time=2012-06-25T00:30:17.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, my character sheet is up to date now.
@time=2012-06-25T00:30:27.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You've still got another reflection fallout, Rashi.
@time=2012-06-25T00:30:41.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's the last four bullets on page 122.
@time=2012-06-25T00:31:02.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :wait, I get two?
@time=2012-06-25T00:31:03.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He didn't even add the mask thing! Shame on him.
@time=2012-06-25T00:31:22.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :my computer's being super slow.
@time=2012-06-25T00:31:24.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You get one from experience fallout and then one from getting through a town.
@time=2012-06-25T00:31:34.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh.
@time=2012-06-25T00:31:46.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Wait, the experience fallout was +1 heart.
@time=2012-06-25T00:31:52.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh. Okay.
@time=2012-06-25T00:31:54.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, he's already done that.
@time=2012-06-25T00:32:04.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, not that.
@time=2012-06-25T00:32:09.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There is an "in addition, choose one of these" section, though, Rashi.
@time=2012-06-25T00:32:13.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah. That.
@time=2012-06-25T00:32:41.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The... what?
@time=2012-06-25T00:32:46.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, next session we arrive in the next town on our route.

@time=2012-06-25T00:34:36.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think it's a bit early for that too.
@time=2012-06-25T00:34:42.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We've only killed one person so far.

@time=2012-06-25T00:37:20.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Um, nah. I'm looking forward to the next town. I hope it isn't quite so demon ravaged and is more dealing with people dealing with sin.
