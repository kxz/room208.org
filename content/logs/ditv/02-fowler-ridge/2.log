@time=2012-06-17T20:10:19.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Things were rather tense last night, what with the specter of an unsolved murder hanging on everyone's minds, but you were able to get a long, if fitful, sleep.
@time=2012-06-17T20:11:01.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Today, you're headed back to Brother Eliezer's place in order to make some headway on finding out who killed Brother Jules, and why.
@time=2012-06-17T20:11:56.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Brother Eliezer is waiting outside of the local officials' post. He looks somewhat weary, but also relieved. Evidently, knowing that the agricultural units will hold out a little longer has eased his worries.
@time=2012-06-17T20:13:59.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Good morning, brothers," he says, waving to you as you approach. "Were you able to rest well? I hope the accommodations were adequate. You likely deserved better, but that's all we had..." **

@time=2012-06-17T20:31:22.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Gideon is momentarily hung up on the fact that his position as a Dog puts him above a Steward, a person who has always been in charge of him until now. After a moment he recovers, "Yes, it's very unfortunate."

@time=2012-06-17T20:45:03.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :AFAP sounds like a very bad sound effect in a doujin.
@time=2012-06-17T20:46:32.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Motoko`kaseijin: You ever played 4th edition DnD?
@time=2012-06-17T20:48:31.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd never actually done any role-playing before ARE.
@time=2012-06-17T20:48:45.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ah, I see.
@time=2012-06-17T20:49:15.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We just introduced a coworker to DnD on Friday. He was a bit confused about the idea of being able to just say what you do. And having a DM.
@time=2012-06-17T20:50:11.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Haha.
@time=2012-06-17T20:50:22.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What do you mean, there aren't any action buttons?"
@time=2012-06-17T20:50:39.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I can kind of see that, yeah.
@time=2012-06-17T20:51:07.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, we played a short encounter with premade characters to get an idea of how the game played. He stole some keys from a guard and then found a chest. Instead of using the keys he spent three turns trying to pick the lock.
@time=2012-06-17T20:51:50.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe he just really wanted to practice lock-picking...
@time=2012-06-17T20:52:41.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe. It was actually a pretty fun little encounter. 4E is kind of weird, but it does make combat less of a hassle.
@time=2012-06-17T20:53:06.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Fewer calculations to make, I take it?
@time=2012-06-17T20:53:12.000Z :Solstace PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Speaking of DnD, I have my setting planned enough to do a trial adventure in a couple weeks, if people are interested.
@time=2012-06-17T20:53:28.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah. And all your skills are on action cards and easy to understand when and how to use them.
@time=2012-06-17T20:53:34.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Solstace: I'd be cool with it.
@time=2012-06-17T20:54:49.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'll probably sit this one out, since I've never been a fan of the D&D style of setting, though I might be persuaded otherwise.
@time=2012-06-17T20:54:55.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, and classes in 4E are divided into archetypes based on how they fight. Very MMO like actually, but that's not a terrible thing when you're just starting into roleplaying.
@time=2012-06-17T20:55:06.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm sure Solstace won't miss the haranguing. >_<
@time=2012-06-17T20:55:25.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Motoko`kaseijin: You should play. We can be a pair of kobolds.

@time=2012-06-17T20:55:40.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, so it makes it easier to understand how the classes are divided?
@time=2012-06-17T20:55:41.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :From a circus.
@time=2012-06-17T20:56:34.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Do our special moves involve throwing opponents into the air and then "barely" failing to catch them on the way down?
@time=2012-06-17T20:56:35.000Z :Solstace PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Motoko`kaseijin: I'm actually trying to avoid the usual kind of DnD setting.  Which is a lot harder than I initially thought XD
@time=2012-06-17T20:56:37.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah. There are strikers, controllers, leaders, and defenders. Strikers do lots of damage. Controllers do crowd control. Leaders buff and debuff. Defenders are tanks.
@time=2012-06-17T20:58:17.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Solstace, yeah, I can imagine. Using the D&D mechanics makes it necessary to have certain aspects no matter what setting you use, I'd guess.
@time=2012-06-17T20:58:34.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, you can always use the d20 Modern stuff.

@time=2012-06-17T20:58:45.000Z :Solstace PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But I'm not really using a modern setting.
@time=2012-06-17T20:59:08.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What kind of setting are you thinking?
@time=2012-06-17T21:00:44.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I've always been a little skittish on mechanics-heavy systems. I think the only reason I made it through ARE is that everyone else was just as new to it. >_>
@time=2012-06-17T21:00:50.000Z :Solstace PRIVMSG #madokamadness :My vague notion going into this was that I wanted something more JRPGish than DnD.

@time=2012-06-17T22:28:15.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The man takes her arms and hoists Constance over his shoulders, not seeming to care about the blood.
@time=2012-06-17T22:28:40.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Gideon half-steps forward, expecting someone to rush forward to help, and is relieved when someone does.
@time=2012-06-17T22:29:44.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The woman looks at Constance, then Rashi and Gideon. "She... something in the way she looked didn't seem... human. I'm so glad you could drive... them... out of her."
@time=2012-06-17T22:29:50.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :**
@time=2012-06-17T22:30:43.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It's part of our duty," Gideon says, attempting to regain control of the situation. "That would be Brother Joseph's sister?"
@time=2012-06-17T22:32:37.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yes. She's ordinarily... not like that, at all. She always seems so happy, so innocent, but... with that innocence comes vulnerability. *They* must have turned her into... into that."
@time=2012-06-17T22:32:42.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :**
@time=2012-06-17T22:35:30.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hm.  We'll see."
@time=2012-06-17T22:35:41.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14I think I'm going to wrap up after this closing conversation. We should be able to finish this town's episode next week.
@time=2012-06-17T22:36:10.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I think we need to talk to her brother," Gideon says, walking towards his horse. He pulls the old rifle from the saddle and slings the strap across his back. "Let's go."
@time=2012-06-17T22:36:16.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Cool, whenever.)
@time=2012-06-17T22:36:41.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, we'll pick up next week as you head down to confront Brother Joseph. *suspense chord*
@time=2012-06-17T22:36:46.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hah.
@time=2012-06-17T22:36:58.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's been two and a half hours and I kind of need to eat. >_<
@time=2012-06-17T22:37:00.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rashi: I'm not monopolizing the sessions or anything, am I?
@time=2012-06-17T22:37:06.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not at all.
@time=2012-06-17T22:37:24.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Cool. Just want to make sure.
@time=2012-06-17T22:37:26.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's really saying a lot about your respective characters, I think.
@time=2012-06-17T22:37:29.000Z :Rashi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also that's a weird thing to ask after most of last time was Rashi versus agriculture in the fight of the century
@time=2012-06-17T22:37:51.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, but I just feel like Gideon is always jumping in and talking and Rashi is like, "Um, okay, yeah."
@time=2012-06-17T22:37:59.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Which does work for the whole character thing.
@time=2012-06-17T22:38:00.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's like we've had a second round of initiations, haha.
@time=2012-06-17T22:38:19.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We need to have a showdown with more than one NPC.
@time=2012-06-17T22:38:27.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Which I assume will be next session.
@time=2012-06-17T22:38:42.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, Joseph does have one sibling left...
@time=2012-06-17T22:38:51.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.
@time=2012-06-17T22:38:53.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Totally not hinting at anything. ^_^
@time=2012-06-17T22:39:21.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm kind of sad that I missed out on at least a little fallout. Damn my excellent skills at exorcism.
@time=2012-06-17T22:39:34.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I figure I'll probably fall apart in the first gunfight.
@time=2012-06-17T22:39:38.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :My dice were kind of terrible, too. Did you see all those 1s?
@time=2012-06-17T22:39:55.000Z :Gideon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah. Not nearly as well as the machine.
@time=2012-06-17T22:40:27.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Those ag units could have gone Skynet on you guys if you didn't stop them.
@time=2012-06-17T22:41:16.000Z :Motoko`kaseijin PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, good session, everyone. I'll fix up logs sometime during the week. Hope you guys enjoyed it.
