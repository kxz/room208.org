@time=2012-04-20T04:32:43.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So now there won't be much about artifact preservation, just a belief that "industrial values" caused ecological disaster and that society should organize in a pre-industrial fashion.
@time=2012-04-20T04:33:32.000Z :n PRIVMSG #madokamadness :anarcho-primitivism, my god
@time=2012-04-20T04:33:49.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I might find some way to work the old idea into the setting somehow, possibly as the motto of some unrelated organization.
@time=2012-04-20T04:34:41.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :-- or no, actually, it'd also work as long as I restricted the vintage of the artifacts in question...
@time=2012-04-20T04:36:55.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I figure that I should do some serious thinking about actually starting this campaign, now that summer is approaching and things seem to be wiiiiiide open.

@time=2012-04-20T04:37:13.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Dogs in the Vineyard.
@time=2012-04-20T04:37:19.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Right. You're doing that?
@time=2012-04-20T04:37:21.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Awesome.
@time=2012-04-20T04:37:55.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe I'll use those next two weeks that I won't be using here to show myself the ropes.
@time=2012-04-20T04:38:35.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BSG would work with DitV.
@time=2012-04-20T04:38:53.000Z :n PRIVMSG #madokamadness :mormons
@time=2012-04-20T04:38:59.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I know precious little about the former, though.
@time=2012-04-20T04:39:00.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Right.
@time=2012-04-20T04:40:40.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The setting I had in mind was essentially space colonists fleeing Earth, which is in the midst of an ecological disaster.
@time=2012-04-20T04:40:54.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, BSG without cylons.
@time=2012-04-20T04:41:08.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And the whole "war" thing.
@time=2012-04-20T04:41:17.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, that sounds cool. I've been wanting to do a relic sci-fi game.
@time=2012-04-20T04:42:14.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think the central faith is going to be what little I know of Mormonism mashed up with primitivism and a bit of archeology, which are two other things I also know little of.
@time=2012-04-20T04:43:20.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Objects from Old Earth before the 20th century or so are held in deep reverence, almost sacred.
@time=2012-04-20T04:43:22.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Motoko: What'll take the place of Coats?
@time=2012-04-20T04:43:33.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Coats?
@time=2012-04-20T04:43:47.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sorry, I don't remember all the terminology.
@time=2012-04-20T04:45:11.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Dogs have coats that are made by their families as reminders of their faith and a source of power against evil.
@time=2012-04-20T04:45:38.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, that might be where the artifacts come in...
@time=2012-04-20T04:48:07.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The original idea I had for the faith was one where history was paramount, basically, and so the adherents were tasked with preserving historical artifacts.
@time=2012-04-20T04:48:33.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I couldn't quite make it gel with the DitV setting until I threw in that whole primitivism thing just fifteen minutes ago.
@time=2012-04-20T04:52:23.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, if you're interested in playing, I'd love feedback, since this is my first time running a campaign at all and everything.
@time=2012-04-20T04:53:04.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm interested.
@time=2012-04-20T04:53:51.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, the main idea would be a group of colonials fleeing a dying Earth? What would be the "towns"?
@time=2012-04-20T04:54:22.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, I imagine they've already settled on a nearby body, Mars or such.
@time=2012-04-20T04:54:56.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There'll be settlements dotted around the place.
@time=2012-04-20T04:55:21.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ah, cool.
@time=2012-04-20T04:55:32.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Do we get to use Old Earth revolvers?
@time=2012-04-20T04:56:31.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Only the adepts are allowed to handle such highly-esteemed weapons!
@time=2012-04-20T04:56:46.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Do we get laser guns then?
@time=2012-04-20T04:58:07.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You'll probably just have to throw rocks at each other.
@time=2012-04-20T04:58:14.000Z :n PRIVMSG #madokamadness :noice.
@time=2012-04-20T04:58:22.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You kill people by making them inhale toxic dust.
@time=2012-04-20T04:58:27.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Workable.
@time=2012-04-20T04:58:45.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mars is terraformed or no?
@time=2012-04-20T05:00:09.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I imagined it as having a habitable surface, but one that still looks very distinctly Mars.
@time=2012-04-20T05:00:30.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Lots of red.
@time=2012-04-20T05:00:36.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Lots.
@time=2012-04-20T05:00:39.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A steeper horizon.
@time=2012-04-20T05:00:50.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Dimmer sunlight.
@time=2012-04-20T05:00:53.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Cool.
@time=2012-04-20T05:01:07.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So the entire thing will be a bit... desert.
@time=2012-04-20T05:01:21.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Makes sense.
@time=2012-04-20T05:01:26.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Plant life?
@time=2012-04-20T05:01:37.000Z :n PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm picturing playing a game in the world of Martian Time-Slip and I like it but none of you have read that
@time=2012-04-20T05:02:48.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Nope. Agricultural centers with specialized facilities, probably, and there might be towns near one of those, but more likely they'll be closer to cities, and we won't be close to cities.
@time=2012-04-20T05:03:25.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hydroponics and such?

@time=2012-04-20T05:05:21.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I imagine bandits often interrupt the shipments?
@time=2012-04-20T05:08:29.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That and they're not very frequent in the first place.
@time=2012-04-20T05:08:49.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Corrupt city governments?
@time=2012-04-20T05:09:07.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or are the small towns part of a less respectable religious persuasion?
@time=2012-04-20T05:09:28.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Apathetic. People wonder why they're sending resources to outsiders.
@time=2012-04-20T05:09:48.000Z :n PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mostly just like the imagery in the book.  Cities were fairly small, and people were very spread out, living along rigid canals, and usually commuting by boat or helicopter.
@time=2012-04-20T05:09:52.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Plus cities are inefficient and bureaucratic.
@time=2012-04-20T05:10:19.000Z :n PRIVMSG #madokamadness :due to, IIRC, the Earth government overestimating the population, they spread out the canals too far, or something
@time=2012-04-20T05:10:32.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That seems likely.
@time=2012-04-20T05:10:47.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Commuting by boat on Mars would be interesting, but I'd be too distracted by how Aria does the same thing.
@time=2012-04-20T05:11:07.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What's the general technology level?
@time=2012-04-20T05:11:22.000Z :n PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The canals were in the middle of deserts, though.  Not much like Space-Venice which is I think Aria's setting?
@time=2012-04-20T05:11:37.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that's about right.
@time=2012-04-20T05:12:08.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Schizophrenic, Iverum. On the one hand, the faith is all about shunning new technology. On the other, it's hard to live on Mars without depending on it to some extent.
@time=2012-04-20T05:12:10.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Aria is the one with the Space Venice that is divided by a wall and has class warfare tones out the wazoo?
@time=2012-04-20T05:12:25.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just the space Venice.
@time=2012-04-20T05:12:47.000Z :n PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Dammit that sounds interesting
@time=2012-04-20T05:12:47.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh. Who had the rest of that then? Let's go find out.
@time=2012-04-20T05:13:13.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Motoko: Pony express instead of instant messages?
@time=2012-04-20T05:13:21.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Class warfare wouldn't really suit the iyashikei vibe.
@time=2012-04-20T05:13:51.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There's not much communications infrastructure outside cities. Information goes in person, or along with the supply shipments.

@time=2012-04-20T05:19:51.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, what's the general aesthetic?
@time=2012-04-20T05:19:56.000Z :n PRIVMSG #madokamadness :in the future, bureaucracy has criminalized the moon
@time=2012-04-20T05:21:51.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Villages of the Old West, on Mars. Spread out. Also a bit dark. Earth is really wheezing at this point, after all.

@time=2012-04-20T05:22:37.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, the towns aren't very old, probably less than a generation or two.
@time=2012-04-20T05:23:16.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not many older folks on Mars?
@time=2012-04-20T05:23:44.000Z :Motoko PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A lot of adherents have personal knowledge of Earth; its woeful state is probably why they decided to abandon industria.
