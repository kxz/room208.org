[20-Apr-2012 04:31:34]  <Motoko> I like the sound of the phrase "in memoriam perpetua," but I think I'm going to make this campaign's central faith a bit less complicated.
[20-Apr-2012 04:32:43]  <Motoko> So now there won't be much about artifact preservation, just a belief that "industrial values" caused ecological disaster and that society should organize in a pre-industrial fashion.
[20-Apr-2012 04:33:32]  <n> anarcho-primitivism, my god
[20-Apr-2012 04:33:49]  <Motoko> I might find some way to work the old idea into the setting somehow, possibly as the motto of some unrelated organization.
[20-Apr-2012 04:34:41]  <Motoko> -- or no, actually, it'd also work as long as I restricted the vintage of the artifacts in question...
[20-Apr-2012 04:36:55]  <Motoko> I figure that I should do some serious thinking about actually starting this campaign, now that summer is approaching and things seem to be wiiiiiide open.
[20-Apr-2012 04:37:02]  * Motoko makes significant glances at certain people
[20-Apr-2012 04:37:04]  <Iverum> Campaign?
[20-Apr-2012 04:37:13]  <Motoko> Dogs in the Vineyard.
[20-Apr-2012 04:37:19]  <Iverum> Right. You're doing that?
[20-Apr-2012 04:37:21]  <Iverum> Awesome.
[20-Apr-2012 04:37:55]  <Motoko> Maybe I'll use those next two weeks that I won't be using here to show myself the ropes.
[20-Apr-2012 04:38:35]  <Iverum> BSG would work with DitV.
[20-Apr-2012 04:38:53]  <n> mormons
[20-Apr-2012 04:38:59]  <Motoko> I know precious little about the former, though.
[20-Apr-2012 04:39:00]  <Iverum> Right.
[20-Apr-2012 04:40:40]  <Motoko> The setting I had in mind was essentially space colonists fleeing Earth, which is in the midst of an ecological disaster.
[20-Apr-2012 04:40:54]  <Iverum> So, BSG without cylons.
[20-Apr-2012 04:41:08]  <Motoko> And the whole "war" thing.
[20-Apr-2012 04:41:17]  <Iverum> Anyway, that sounds cool. I've been wanting to do a relic sci-fi game.
[20-Apr-2012 04:42:14]  <Motoko> I think the central faith is going to be what little I know of Mormonism mashed up with primitivism and a bit of archeology, which are two other things I also know little of.
[20-Apr-2012 04:43:20]  <Motoko> Objects from Old Earth before the 20th century or so are held in deep reverence, almost sacred.
[20-Apr-2012 04:43:22]  <Iverum> Motoko: What'll take the place of Coats?
[20-Apr-2012 04:43:33]  <Motoko> Coats?
[20-Apr-2012 04:43:47]  <Motoko> Sorry, I don't remember all the terminology.
[20-Apr-2012 04:45:11]  <Iverum> Dogs have coats that are made by their families as reminders of their faith and a source of power against evil.
[20-Apr-2012 04:45:38]  <Motoko> Oh, that might be where the artifacts come in...
[20-Apr-2012 04:48:07]  <Motoko> The original idea I had for the faith was one where history was paramount, basically, and so the adherents were tasked with preserving historical artifacts.
[20-Apr-2012 04:48:33]  <Motoko> I couldn't quite make it gel with the DitV setting until I threw in that whole primitivism thing just fifteen minutes ago.
[20-Apr-2012 04:52:23]  <Motoko> Anyway, if you're interested in playing, I'd love feedback, since this is my first time running a campaign at all and everything.
[20-Apr-2012 04:53:04]  <Iverum> I'm interested.
[20-Apr-2012 04:53:51]  <Iverum> So, the main idea would be a group of colonials fleeing a dying Earth? What would be the "towns"?
[20-Apr-2012 04:54:22]  <Motoko> Oh, I imagine they've already settled on a nearby body, Mars or such.
[20-Apr-2012 04:54:56]  <Motoko> There'll be settlements dotted around the place.
[20-Apr-2012 04:55:21]  <Iverum> Ah, cool.
[20-Apr-2012 04:55:32]  <Iverum> Do we get to use Old Earth revolvers?
[20-Apr-2012 04:56:31]  <Motoko> Only the adepts are allowed to handle such highly-esteemed weapons!
[20-Apr-2012 04:56:46]  <Iverum> Do we get laser guns then?
[20-Apr-2012 04:58:07]  <Motoko> You'll probably just have to throw rocks at each other.
[20-Apr-2012 04:58:14]  <n> noice.
[20-Apr-2012 04:58:22]  <Motoko> You kill people by making them inhale toxic dust.
[20-Apr-2012 04:58:27]  <Iverum> Workable.
[20-Apr-2012 04:58:45]  <Iverum> Mars is terraformed or no?
[20-Apr-2012 05:00:09]  <Motoko> I imagined it as having a habitable surface, but one that still looks very distinctly Mars.
[20-Apr-2012 05:00:30]  <Iverum> Lots of red.
[20-Apr-2012 05:00:36]  <Motoko> Lots.
[20-Apr-2012 05:00:39]  <Iverum> A steeper horizon.
[20-Apr-2012 05:00:50]  <Iverum> Dimmer sunlight.
[20-Apr-2012 05:00:53]  <Iverum> Cool.
[20-Apr-2012 05:01:07]  <Motoko> So the entire thing will be a bit... desert.
[20-Apr-2012 05:01:21]  <Iverum> Makes sense.
[20-Apr-2012 05:01:26]  <Iverum> Plant life?
[20-Apr-2012 05:01:37]  <n> I'm picturing playing a game in the world of Martian Time-Slip and I like it but none of you have read that
[20-Apr-2012 05:02:48]  <Motoko> Nope. Agricultural centers with specialized facilities, probably, and there might be towns near one of those, but more likely they'll be closer to cities, and we won't be close to cities.
[20-Apr-2012 05:03:25]  <Iverum> Hydroponics and such?
[20-Apr-2012 05:03:32]  <Iverum> @w martian time-slip
[20-Apr-2012 05:03:33]  <Motoko> The cities produce pretty much everything and the small towns are dependent on supply shipments.
[20-Apr-2012 05:03:33]  <Omnipresence> Iverum: Wikipedia (full-text): Martian Time-Slip: Martian Time-Slip is a 1964 science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick. The novel uses the common science fiction concept of a huma... — http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_Time-Slip
[20-Apr-2012 05:05:21]  <Iverum> I imagine bandits often interrupt the shipments?
[20-Apr-2012 05:08:29]  <Motoko> That and they're not very frequent in the first place.
[20-Apr-2012 05:08:49]  <Iverum> Corrupt city governments?
[20-Apr-2012 05:09:07]  <Iverum> Or are the small towns part of a less respectable religious persuasion?
[20-Apr-2012 05:09:28]  <Motoko> Apathetic. People wonder why they're sending resources to outsiders.
[20-Apr-2012 05:09:48]  <n> I mostly just like the imagery in the book.  Cities were fairly small, and people were very spread out, living along rigid canals, and usually commuting by boat or helicopter.
[20-Apr-2012 05:09:52]  <Motoko> Plus cities are inefficient and bureaucratic.
[20-Apr-2012 05:10:19]  <n> due to, IIRC, the Earth government overestimating the population, they spread out the canals too far, or something
[20-Apr-2012 05:10:32]  <Iverum> That seems likely.
[20-Apr-2012 05:10:47]  <Motoko> Commuting by boat on Mars would be interesting, but I'd be too distracted by how Aria does the same thing.
[20-Apr-2012 05:11:07]  <Iverum> What's the general technology level?
[20-Apr-2012 05:11:22]  <n> The canals were in the middle of deserts, though.  Not much like Space-Venice which is I think Aria's setting?
[20-Apr-2012 05:11:37]  <Motoko> Yeah, that's about right.
[20-Apr-2012 05:12:08]  <Motoko> Schizophrenic, Iverum. On the one hand, the faith is all about shunning new technology. On the other, it's hard to live on Mars without depending on it to some extent.
[20-Apr-2012 05:12:10]  <Iverum> Aria is the one with the Space Venice that is divided by a wall and has class warfare tones out the wazoo?
[20-Apr-2012 05:12:25]  <Motoko> Just the space Venice.
[20-Apr-2012 05:12:47]  <n> Dammit that sounds interesting
[20-Apr-2012 05:12:47]  <Iverum> Oh. Who had the rest of that then? Let's go find out.
[20-Apr-2012 05:13:13]  <Iverum> Motoko: Pony express instead of instant messages?
[20-Apr-2012 05:13:21]  <Motoko> Class warfare wouldn't really suit the iyashikei vibe.
[20-Apr-2012 05:13:51]  <Motoko> There's not much communications infrastructure outside cities. Information goes in person, or along with the supply shipments.

[20-Apr-2012 05:14:37]  <Omnipresence> URL: [thejotaku.tumblr.com] Tako Tako Tako Tako Tak Tak Tako
[20-Apr-2012 05:15:51]  <n> any relation to Tako?
[20-Apr-2012 05:15:58]  <Iverum> Not that I can see.
[20-Apr-2012 05:16:17]  <n> oh, I saw that acquariwhatever thing, what is it.
[20-Apr-2012 05:16:52]  <Motoko> I'm trying to think of technology that would be acceptable to adherents. Maybe medical, for pragmatic reasons.
[20-Apr-2012 05:17:04]  <Motoko> After all, that toxic Martian dust is *everywhere*.
[20-Apr-2012 05:17:25]  <Iverum> Do they where respirators all the time?
[20-Apr-2012 05:17:28]  <Iverum> *wear
[20-Apr-2012 05:17:51]  <n> cool image.
[20-Apr-2012 05:18:09]  <Motoko> The toxic dust is a joke, but sandstorms can't be good for the soul. Or the respiratory system.
[20-Apr-2012 05:18:39]  <ponicalica> Isn't Mars dust actually really toxic?
[20-Apr-2012 05:19:10]  <Motoko> Possibly, but I'm not considering it in the setting.
[20-Apr-2012 05:19:22]  <Iverum> Moon dust is terrible because it sticks to your lungs.
[20-Apr-2012 05:19:25]  <Iverum> Like asbestos.
[20-Apr-2012 05:19:51]  <Iverum> So, what's the general aesthetic?
[20-Apr-2012 05:19:56]  <n> in the future, bureaucracy has criminalized the moon
[20-Apr-2012 05:21:51]  <Motoko> Villages of the Old West, on Mars. Spread out. Also a bit dark. Earth is really wheezing at this point, after all.
[20-Apr-2012 05:22:01]  <Motoko> And the Sun is further away and all that.
[20-Apr-2012 05:22:37]  <Motoko> Oh, the towns aren't very old, probably less than a generation or two.
[20-Apr-2012 05:23:16]  <Iverum> Not many older folks on Mars?
[20-Apr-2012 05:23:44]  <Motoko> A lot of adherents have personal knowledge of Earth; its woeful state is probably why they decided to abandon industria.
[20-Apr-2012 05:24:07]  <Motoko> There'll be older people; they just won't have been there all that long, relatively speaking.
[20-Apr-2012 05:24:31]  <Iverum> I see.
[20-Apr-2012 05:24:50]  <Motoko> I'm thinking things only got *really* bad within the last few decades, so some older people will know what things were like "before."
[20-Apr-2012 05:25:20]  <n> what is "bad", here?
[20-Apr-2012 05:25:22]  <Motoko> Still, it's long enough and far enough for truths to get distorted or forgotten.
[20-Apr-2012 05:25:33]  <Motoko> The state of Earth, n.
[20-Apr-2012 05:25:41]  <n> I know, I meant how.
[20-Apr-2012 05:25:50]  <Iverum> Constant toxic rain.
[20-Apr-2012 05:25:58]  <n> Eergh
[20-Apr-2012 05:26:28]  <Motoko> Massive climate change, major crop collapses, pandemonium in the streets.
[20-Apr-2012 05:26:55]  <Motoko> Pollution, overcrowding, basically the Malthusian environmentalist's nightmare.
[20-Apr-2012 05:28:42]  <Motoko> If you're rich, you're sipping martinis in a bubble home hanging over what used to be Cancun, but if you're not, you could do worse than to try the stars.
[20-Apr-2012 05:29:36]  <n> right right.
[20-Apr-2012 05:29:38]  <Motoko> I'll think more about this later; in the meantime, I have sleep to make up for. Good night.
