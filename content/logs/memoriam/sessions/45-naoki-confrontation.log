@time=2015-07-01T22:43:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Last time we found out where our presumed murderer might be: vacationing in a country inn.
@time=2015-07-01T22:43:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Pretty chill of him, don't you think?
@time=2015-07-01T22:43:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, what's the plan, my friends?
@time=2015-07-01T22:44:10.000Z :Icon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Everyone can appreciate a relaxing stay at a country inn. Except maybe Rin.
@time=2015-07-01T22:45:24.000Z :Icon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So we could either storm the place, or gather more info somehow. One is more reasonable than the other. One is also more fitting.
@time=2015-07-01T22:45:27.000Z :Icon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :for us*
@time=2015-07-01T22:45:30.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think some rest and recuperation and then finding the guy and kicking his teeth in
@time=2015-07-01T22:45:35.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well, how much more info can we even gather
@time=2015-07-01T22:45:42.000Z :Icon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mmm.
@time=2015-07-01T22:46:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno. We could gather info about the amenities of the inn.
@time=2015-07-01T22:47:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Are you planning a vacation?
@time=2015-07-01T22:48:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm not going unless it has an attached hot spring."
@time=2015-07-01T22:48:14.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki could use a break.
@time=2015-07-01T22:48:33.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Floorplan in order to plan an attack, I guess, but that seems like a detail that doesn't matter too much to our narration
@time=2015-07-01T22:49:20.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :some relaxing at the inn before magicking the guy to death sounds good
@time=2015-07-01T22:49:23.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But honestly, yeah, I dunno if gathering more information is very useful.
@time=2015-07-01T22:49:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was thinking more a distinction between going in with guns blazing and... not doing that.
@time=2015-07-01T22:50:27.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We could just confront him normally. Claim we believe he's responsible for the deaths and on a mission of vengeance.
@time=2015-07-01T22:52:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Normal? What? You can't do things normally!
@time=2015-07-01T22:52:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Dramatically then
@time=2015-07-01T22:52:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, anyway, so I suppose that's the "stroll in the front door and ask" strategy.
@time=2015-07-01T22:52:20.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :isn't that our normal though?
@time=2015-07-01T22:52:56.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Do we have any solid evidence?
@time=2015-07-01T22:53:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mean, the sorta-confession kinda.
@time=2015-07-01T22:53:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Righteous anger?
@time=2015-07-01T22:53:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mean, that's a motivator for at least two people.
@time=2015-07-01T22:54:06.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyone else have other ideas?
@time=2015-07-01T22:54:37.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not really
@time=2015-07-01T22:54:46.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ambush, maybe, but he's probably paranoid and holed in at this point
@time=2015-07-01T22:55:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I like the straight up confront the guy and expect him not to try to kill us (like always).
@time=2015-07-01T22:56:04.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :...would it have been possible to get the magical fingerprint off of whatever was possessing Murata or is it too late for that now/wouldn't have given us anything?
@time=2015-07-01T22:56:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's a bit late for that now.
@time=2015-07-01T22:58:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I guess we're just strolling in, then.
@time=2015-07-01T22:58:30.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well I guess we can add 'an inn' to the list of things destroyed by the conservators...
@time=2015-07-01T22:58:59.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm good with that, no one else seems to have any other strong feelings.
@time=2015-07-01T22:59:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Uh, I don't think the insurance company's going to be happy with that.
@time=2015-07-01T22:59:17.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: magical girls are an insurance company's worst enemy
@time=2015-07-01T22:59:25.000Z :Icon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :o7
@time=2015-07-01T22:59:33.000Z :Icon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah I'm fine with direct confrontation.
@time=2015-07-01T22:59:48.000Z :Icon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't think any of us really know subtle anyway.
@time=2015-07-01T22:59:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shioiri, where the inn is, is about two hours away by train. It's a long ride.
@time=2015-07-01T22:59:53.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And I think direct confrontation is basically how it's going to go, yeah
@time=2015-07-01T23:00:00.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't think our groups been good with doing things any other way?
@time=2015-07-01T23:01:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's already evening by the time the Conservators arrive at the station, which is little more than a wooden box with a bored-looking middle-aged staff member sitting at a desk in one corner.
@time=2015-07-01T23:01:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He points the way towards the inn, not batting an eye at the motley group of youngsters disembarking from the train in the middle of nowhere.
@time=2015-07-01T23:03:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Totally normal.
@time=2015-07-01T23:03:49.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Happens a lot here.
@time=2015-07-01T23:04:17.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :probably students on a vacation or something
@time=2015-07-01T23:04:26.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :japan has vacations, right?
@time=2015-07-01T23:04:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The road up - and it is up, about a kilometer ascending a hill - goes from paved to loose gravel distressingly quickly. Hope you wore good shoes.
@time=2015-07-01T23:06:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Soon enough, the inn comes into view. It looks like it's been standing for at least a hundred years. The name is written on a plate hanging over the entrance, though none of the Conservators can figure out how exactly it's supposed to be pronounced.
@time=2015-07-01T23:07:36.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so this is a really traditionally old japanese hotel?
@time=2015-07-01T23:07:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :An older woman stands behind the reception desk in the otherwise empty foyer. She tilts her head quizzically as Kazuki walks in. By the time the girls file in, she looks positively baffled.
@time=2015-07-01T23:08:29.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("We're looking for a Prophet, do you think you can tell me his room number?")
@time=2015-07-01T23:09:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Can I help you?" she asks.
@time=2015-07-01T23:09:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :This is where we ask about the hot springs, right?
@time=2015-07-01T23:10:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Uh, sure.
@time=2015-07-01T23:11:23.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki smiles at the woman, "We were supposed to meet Miyama here. Could you tell us where we can find him?"
@time=2015-07-01T23:13:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Miyama?" She ponders for a second, then: "I can tell him that someone's looking for him here. How should I introduce you?"
@time=2015-07-01T23:15:07.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"He'll know me by mister Sakura, I believe." (I don't remember how names work)
@time=2015-07-01T23:15:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Just a moment."
@time=2015-07-01T23:16:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The woman disappears behind a curtain at the back of the room.
@time=2015-07-01T23:16:25.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: you probably want whichever honorifics go to "mister Sakura" anyways I think?
@time=2015-07-01T23:16:41.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She seems fairly unpreturbed by Kazuki's silent entourage.
@time=2015-07-01T23:16:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A deep silence settles down on the room.
@time=2015-07-01T23:17:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki wonders for a moment if he should try to mask the presence of all their magic.
@time=2015-07-01T23:17:59.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He doesn't bother though. Perhaps the mesh of magic will better approximate his father's, who will probably be the first person Miyama would think of.
@time=2015-07-01T23:18:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The lights flicker slightly, as if they're candles in a light breeze.
@time=2015-07-01T23:19:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki glances over at Ayako for reassurance.
@time=2015-07-01T23:19:18.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin thinks for a moment, then asks Kazuki, "You know Miyama?"
@time=2015-07-01T23:19:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I imagine my father does."
@time=2015-07-01T23:20:22.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :do we know your father's a prophet?
@time=2015-07-01T23:20:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't think he's kept it a secret.
@time=2015-07-01T23:20:47.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm running with rin pretty much just learning that :/
@time=2015-07-01T23:21:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That'd be fine. We'll just say that he hasn't kept it hushed up, but he didn't advertise it.
@time=2015-07-01T23:21:18.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Your father...he's a Prophet, right?"
@time=2015-07-01T23:21:26.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Ayako is more likely to remember than Rin is)
@time=2015-07-01T23:22:49.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki nods, "He is. Miyama would at least know him by that."
@time=2015-07-01T23:23:43.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She's been a while," Kazuki says idly.
@time=2015-07-01T23:24:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, I was waiting for you to finish.
@time=2015-07-01T23:25:12.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :suddenly, without warning, Hikari gets struck by a lightning bolt
@time=2015-07-01T23:25:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, feel free to ignore that then. I just didn't know if Rin wanted to push further about the Prophetness.
@time=2015-07-01T23:26:01.000Z :Icon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I didn't know what to say :I
@time=2015-07-01T23:26:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The Prophetness would make a good alt hip-hop album title.
@time=2015-07-01T23:26:47.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari would probably have a lot of the Prophets' names memorized.
@time=2015-07-01T23:26:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway.
@time=2015-07-01T23:28:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Not the Sakura I was expecting."
@time=2015-07-01T23:28:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The voice is deep and a little too calm. Like the villain in some British film.
@time=2015-07-01T23:29:05.000Z :Xeniera JOIN #madokamadness

@time=2015-07-01T23:30:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Naoki Miyama is dressed in a light yukata. Unseasonable, considering it's still January.

@time=2015-07-01T23:30:16.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :magic, clearly
@time=2015-07-01T23:30:37.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the arc ends with Prophet Miyama dropping a car on the Conservators
@time=2015-07-01T23:30:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What brings you here?"
@time=2015-07-01T23:31:32.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We're here to talk about some recent issues with the Consilium Renascens."
@time=2015-07-01T23:31:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki steels himself to address the man... and finds himself cut off by Ayako.
@time=2015-07-01T23:31:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :pwned
@time=2015-07-01T23:32:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You'll have to forgive me. I wasn't aware the council was under the oversight of the Conservators."
@time=2015-07-01T23:34:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Is Ayako gonna continue?
@time=2015-07-01T23:35:44.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako ponders a response.  A breach of the Order's heirarchy must be very carefully considered.
@time=2015-07-01T23:35:58.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Her pondering leaves her open to getting cut off by Kazuki or Hikari)
@time=2015-07-01T23:36:03.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(not putting much stock in Rin tbh)
@time=2015-07-01T23:37:01.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"There were some irregularities with the council. We were sent to investigate them and we've been lead to you."
@time=2015-07-01T23:37:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Do you mind if we go somewhere private?" Kazuki says, feeling that this conversation would be better suited outside of the lobby of this inn.
@time=2015-07-01T23:39:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Miyama thinks for a moment.
@time=2015-07-01T23:39:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I do have a room," he then says, with a cordial smile.
@time=2015-07-01T23:39:32.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, Miyama-san, you're so forward.
@time=2015-07-01T23:40:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki nods, "That might be more appropriate, if you don't mind."

@time=2015-07-01T23:44:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Miyama gestures to the Conservators to enter, closing the sliding door behind them afterwards.
@time=2015-07-01T23:44:07.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the Kazuki/Naoki shippers won't care

@time=2015-07-01T23:44:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Tea?" he asks. A pot sits on the room's center table.

@time=2015-07-01T23:45:13.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :pfff
@time=2015-07-01T23:47:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Guess not," he says, taking a seat at one end of the table. "Well, then, you'll have to describe to me what these... irregularities are that brought you all the way out here."
@time=2015-07-01T23:47:39.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sorry, stepped out to grab a glass of water.
@time=2015-07-01T23:48:26.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Are you familiar with a Takako Murata?"
@time=2015-07-01T23:48:47.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She was the only voter on a surprising number of initiatiations."

@time=2015-07-01T23:51:29.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That's what appeared when we checked the messages.  That and something about a key?"
@time=2015-07-01T23:52:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Miyama's face lights up with an obviously feigned curiosity.
@time=2015-07-01T23:53:27.000Z :Icon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He sounds really punchable right now.
@time=2015-07-01T23:53:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"This is very unusual. What is this key you're talking about?"
@time=2015-07-01T23:53:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He offered you tea! Come, now, where is your courtesy?
@time=2015-07-01T23:54:21.000Z :Icon PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Point.
@time=2015-07-01T23:54:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki certainly would have accepted tea, but someone couldn't wait for me to get back from getting water.
@time=2015-07-01T23:58:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno where Ayako was going with the key thing.
@time=2015-07-01T23:58:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So are we punching him, answering his question, what?
@time=2015-07-01T23:58:16.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the key thing was something murata called herself
@time=2015-07-01T23:58:32.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It's something Murata called herself when we confronted her."
@time=2015-07-01T23:58:39.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, but I don't have anything interesting to say about answering his question other than... well that.

@time=2015-07-02T00:01:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sorry, just a sec.

@time=2015-07-02T00:04:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm sorry, but I'm still not sure what you're getting at."
@time=2015-07-02T00:05:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He drums on the table with the fingers on his right hand.
