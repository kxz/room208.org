[30-May-2015 19:07:08]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Hype Williams | IDEOGRAMMATIC: JackMackerel baiting
[30-May-2015 19:07:50]  <IllFlower> Kazuki and his mother sit across from each other at the cafe table.
[30-May-2015 19:08:24]  <IllFlower> The other Conservators have "left," but are mostly staring inside through the exterior windows.
[30-May-2015 19:08:45]  <Calica> I'm just imagining the three girls with their faces against the windows
[30-May-2015 19:09:10]  <Icon> Nah. Hikari, naturally, would be trying to keep the other two away and be the "mature" one, while catching glances herself.
[30-May-2015 19:09:40]  <BGTB2005> I think Rin would be paying more attention to her phone at the moment
[30-May-2015 19:09:42]  <IllFlower> Miss Kataoka speaks first, after a long silence. "There's something I need to explain to you before I can tell your friends about what I was thinking of. It wouldn't be fair to you."
[30-May-2015 19:10:50]  <Calica> ("I'm not your real mother.")
[30-May-2015 19:11:10]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[30-May-2015 19:11:11]  <IllFlower> She loops a finger through her teacup and takes a sip. Her eyes dart around the cafe with a slightly agitated edge.
[30-May-2015 19:11:11]  <Rig> Kazuki sits silently, doing his best to keep his expression neutral.
[30-May-2015 19:11:28]  <IllFlower> "Do you remember Sena Miyama?"
[30-May-2015 19:12:15]  <Rig> "No. Should I?" (Should I?)
[30-May-2015 19:12:24]  <IllFlower> Not particularly.
[30-May-2015 19:13:43]  <Calica> okay, Sena Miyama doesn't seem to be in the summary list
[30-May-2015 19:14:13]  <Icon> Ah, yes, Mouth Silence. Perfect music for this.
[30-May-2015 19:15:10]  <IllFlower> "She was the daughter of a Prophet. Naoki Miyama. You might have seen him on occasion around your father.
[30-May-2015 19:16:37]  <IllFlower> "It turned out that she was responsible for almost killing another initiate, and a tribunal stripped her powers for five years. She committed suicide not long after that.
[30-May-2015 19:16:49]  * BGTB2005 checks JDIC and memorial wall
[30-May-2015 19:16:58]  <IllFlower> "This was right before I left the Order."
[30-May-2015 19:17:57]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's mother pauses again.
[30-May-2015 19:18:37]  <Rig> Have we had anyone else commit suicide after losing their powers? I can't remember.
[30-May-2015 19:18:50]  <IllFlower> Not to my memory.
[30-May-2015 19:18:59]  <Calica> I can't remember either
[30-May-2015 19:19:02]  <Rig> Okay, must have been something I made up.
[30-May-2015 19:19:13]  *** eriophora <~Christine@c-73-181-245-125.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has joined #madokamadness
[30-May-2015 19:19:49]  <IllFlower> She seems to wait for a response, though what Kazuki could possibly say here is an open question.
[30-May-2015 19:19:56]  <BGTB2005> think that's the first mentioned occurrence with that specific cause
[30-May-2015 19:20:24]  <Rig> "Did you leave because of that?" Kazuki asks, but he's fairly sure that's not the reason. He remembers her concerns being voiced rather loudly.
[30-May-2015 19:22:32]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's mother bites her lip. "The identities of the judges who served on that particular case were kept secret, precisely because Sena's father was a Prophet. He was convinced that she was innocent, and people were worried that he'd exert pressure on whoever made the decision."
[30-May-2015 19:22:59]  <Rig> (The first mention that this justice system even has judges.)
[30-May-2015 19:23:25]  <IllFlower> More of an inquisition, really.
[30-May-2015 19:23:40]  <IllFlower> Not a Spanish one, though.
[30-May-2015 19:23:40]  <Rig> Nobody expects.... sorry.
[30-May-2015 19:24:24]  <IllFlower> (I told you the Order is more than a little like the Catholic Church.)
[30-May-2015 19:24:48]  <Rig> I didn't notice.
[30-May-2015 19:26:28]  <Rig> I don't know if Kazuki is supposed to respond. I'd imagine he's waiting for her to spill it.
[30-May-2015 19:27:56]  <IllFlower> "There were three of us. I thought we made the right decision at the time. I still do.
[30-May-2015 19:28:31]  <IllFlower> "But it's hard to keep going when you feel like a young girl lost her life because of that decision."
[30-May-2015 19:30:24]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's mother looks into his eyes.
[30-May-2015 19:30:24]  <Rig> Kazuki stares at his untouched cup. He can understand that feeling. It is hard to keep going when it seems like any decision you make leads to someone being hurt.
[30-May-2015 19:30:44]  <Rig> He doesn't meet her eyes as he mumbles, "I understand."
[30-May-2015 19:31:20]  <IllFlower> "You're the first person I've said anything about this to. Not even your father knows, though I'm sure he has his suspicions. He can look at the timing of when I left and put two and two together."
[30-May-2015 19:33:25]  <IllFlower> A soft piano background track floats through the cafe.
[30-May-2015 19:34:32]  <Rig> Kazuki cannot understand why she's telling this to him now. He's not certain why an event so long ago would connect to Chiaki.
[30-May-2015 19:34:51]  <Calica> maybe you should ask that
[30-May-2015 19:34:53]  <Rig> "What are you going to tell the others?"
[30-May-2015 19:36:48]  <IllFlower> "Your friend Minakami mentioned something. That whoever killed Oonishi and Shimamura seemed to be targeting my students. She said a familiar was trying to recruit Hikami as well.
[30-May-2015 19:37:19]  <IllFlower> "If we assume there's a pattern, the only thing tying those three together is me. Their teacher.
[30-May-2015 19:37:59]  <IllFlower> "And then there are the sightings of a middle-aged man around campus.
[30-May-2015 19:38:24]  <Rig> "Naoki," Kazuki says.
[30-May-2015 19:39:07]  <IllFlower> "He's the only magic wielder I can think of who would have the motivation to do this."
[30-May-2015 19:40:16]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's mother stares down at her now-empty teacup. "He can't hurt me directly since I left the Order, but..."
[30-May-2015 19:40:23]  <Rig> Another Prophet as his team's suspect. This was a dangerous path to keep treading. Kazuki looked at his mother, wondering if she felt responsible for the attacks on her students.
[30-May-2015 19:41:01]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:208a:c8ff:f989:7b75> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.91.1 [Firefox 38.0.1/20150513174244])
[30-May-2015 19:41:04]  <IllFlower> Hey, Yuuya was only one in training.
[30-May-2015 19:41:22]  <Calica> Still, though.
[30-May-2015 19:41:30]  <Rig> I'm sure there is some kind of record in the Order called "Possible Dissidents" and our team is racing to the top.
[30-May-2015 19:41:55]  <Rig> We've let one group get away, we practically killed a possible prophet, and now we're possibly blaming another.
[30-May-2015 19:41:57]  <IllFlower> Nah, it's more like the CIA. Everyone's working against each other and they don't even realize it.
[30-May-2015 19:42:07]  <Rig> Just like a church.
[30-May-2015 19:42:49]  <IllFlower> It's the Catholic-ish Initiate Agency.
[30-May-2015 19:42:55]  *** Haruspex <~Glossina@66.96.79.231> has joined #madokamadness
[30-May-2015 19:43:12]  <IllFlower> Is Kazuki going to say any of this? :p
[30-May-2015 19:43:23]  <Rig> Hang on, trying to type a decent response.
[30-May-2015 19:44:06]  <Rig> "We can't just lay the blame on him," Kazuki says. "He's a prophet. Besides, if we do and we're wrong then you'll be outed for certain."
[30-May-2015 19:44:30]  <Rig> "And I'm fairly certain that my team is not on the best terms with the Prophets at the moment."
[30-May-2015 19:44:40]  <Calica> 12:41 <@Rig> I'm sure there is some kind of record in the Order called "Possible Dissidents" and our team is racing to the top. <---The RP ends with a Prophet coming in and bringing the whole thing down
[30-May-2015 19:45:31]  <IllFlower> "I know," Kazuki's mother says. "I don't have evidence to suggest it's him, either.
[30-May-2015 19:45:58]  <Rig> Kazuki mulls for a moment. He tries to get the words ordered properly in his mind, but can't find a way to frame them without accusing her of running away.
[30-May-2015 19:46:15]  <IllFlower> "He can hide behind the familiars when it comes to how the dead initiates were recruited.
[30-May-2015 19:46:41]  <IllFlower> "And I doubt he's sloppy enough to just go and cast the fatal spell himself."
[30-May-2015 19:48:48]  <Rig> Kazuki sighs. "It isn't likely to be easy to track this all back to him." He pushes his still full cup of tea away. "I think it'd be best if we tried to keep your students out of the Order. It will at least keep them safer."
[30-May-2015 19:50:07]  <IllFlower> "I agree."
[30-May-2015 19:50:37]  *** Buttercupistiny <~chatzilla@2602:306:834e:5780:21aa:423e:2ec5:e227> has joined #madokamadness

[30-May-2015 19:50:41]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's mother looks up at her son again.
[30-May-2015 19:50:43]  <Rig> Kazuki briefly realizes that he just agreed to the exact same logic that his mother tried to use to keep him out originally.
[30-May-2015 19:51:55]  <Rig> Did you have something to add, IllFlower?
[30-May-2015 19:53:14]  <IllFlower> "You should stay safe, too. I don't know if he'll be bold enough to go after you or your father, since neither of you is exactly out of the limelight, but I'd hate to see something happen to you.
[30-May-2015 19:53:53]  <IllFlower> "Promise?" she says.
[30-May-2015 19:54:07]  <Calica> ("I'm a Conservator, Mom.  Jeez.")
[30-May-2015 19:55:58]  <Rig> "I know that this isn't the life you wanted for me, but I am here now. I have seen enough people get hurt now to know that this life is dangerous, and I can't stop that, but I'll try to keep an eye out for myself." Kazuki meets his mother's eyes.
[30-May-2015 19:57:40]  <IllFlower> "Thanks."
[30-May-2015 19:58:07]  <Rig> Kazuki just nods, not sure what else to say or do.
[30-May-2015 19:59:08]  <IllFlower> Now is as good a time to awkwardly close the conversation and return to your colleagues as any.
[30-May-2015 19:59:18]  <Rig> I agree.
[30-May-2015 19:59:37]  <Rig> Should we invite them back in or go out to meet them and then move to the next scene after imparting this knowledge.
[30-May-2015 20:00:11]  <IllFlower> It's up to you. I'd personally do the latter.
[30-May-2015 20:00:21]  <Rig> I think that'd be the best too.
[30-May-2015 20:00:45]  <Rig> Mind if I take the lead for that bit?
[30-May-2015 20:01:34]  <IllFlower> Go right ahead.
[30-May-2015 20:02:39]  <Rig> With that awkward silence Kazuki figures that their talk is over. It was not as rough as he'd been expecting. He drops a few bills in the tray with the check at the end of the table and follows his mother out of the cafe.
[30-May-2015 20:03:03]  <Rig> His teammates are doing their best to appear disinterested and otherwise occupied as they exit, but the only convincing one is Rin.
[30-May-2015 20:03:37]  <IllFlower> And that's because Rin never looks interested in anything.
[30-May-2015 20:04:21]  <Rig> "We have a lead on possible suspects," he starts, but he can't find a decent way to lay out his mother's suspicions. After a moment of fumbling he looks to her.
[30-May-2015 20:04:38]  <IllFlower> Oh, is she still around?
[30-May-2015 20:04:49]  <Calica> he just started to walk out so
[30-May-2015 20:05:03]  <IllFlower> I was thinking Kazuki would relay what she said and omit all the sensitive parts.
[30-May-2015 20:05:13]  <Rig> Oh, we can do that.
[30-May-2015 20:05:17]  <IllFlower> ("'His name is Naoki Miyama.' Then he shuts up.")
[30-May-2015 20:05:29]  <Rig> Let's walk that back a bit.
[30-May-2015 20:06:34]  <IllFlower> <<REW
[30-May-2015 20:06:47]  <Rig> After a moment of fumbling Kazuki manages to summarize part of their conversation. His mother suspects that a high-ranking Order member is targeting her students in an act of vengeance. They agreed that for the moment the best choice is to keep her students from becoming initiates.
[30-May-2015 20:07:07]  <Rig> He stops and looks at his team, expecting objections and questions.
[30-May-2015 20:07:44]  <Calica> "You want to accuse a high-ranking member of the Order?"
[30-May-2015 20:08:03]  <Rig> "No, I want to surreptiously investigate a Prophet."
[30-May-2015 20:08:23]  <Icon> "That is fine by me. He's our only lead anyway, yes?"
[30-May-2015 20:09:18]  <Rig> "Unless Rin has more information from Chiaki. But I think we need to do this quietly, either way."
[30-May-2015 20:09:42]  <Rig> "Our suspicions cannot leave our team. No one can know until we're ready."
[30-May-2015 20:09:53]  <Icon> Hikari nods in agreement.
[30-May-2015 20:10:15]  <IllFlower> (Kazuki looks very pointedly at Hikari, who's playing a game on her pho-- oh, never mind.)
[30-May-2015 20:10:29]  <Calica> Ayako grimaces skeptically.  "...I can do that."
[30-May-2015 20:10:53]  <BGTB2005> Rin gives a small nod
[30-May-2015 20:10:58]  <Rig> (Rin is too busy looking at pictures of cars and fire on her phone... nvm)
[30-May-2015 20:11:43]  <Rig> "Do we have the name of the familiar that's been recruiting at Chiaki's school?"
[30-May-2015 20:11:43]  <Calica> ("Why is your porn folder entirely full of Ford Pintos?"
[30-May-2015 20:11:50]  <Icon> (I like to think Rin noticed that Hikari nodded, out of the corner of her eye, and nodded in agreement from that.)
[30-May-2015 20:11:53]  <IllFlower> (Ayako doesn't have a cell phone. Poor Ayako.)
[30-May-2015 20:12:15]  <Rig> (The only person Ayako would call died in a train crash, remember?)
[30-May-2015 20:12:16]  <BGTB2005> (I was thinking she was watching a stream of some race on the other side of the planet and/or for any more texts from Chiaki)
[30-May-2015 20:12:17]  <IllFlower> Yeah, it's Myaa. Chiaki mentioned it.
[30-May-2015 20:13:12]  <Rig> I was thinking we'd figure out why they're recruiting from the school so frequently.
[30-May-2015 20:13:59]  <IllFlower> You get to find out how the sausage is made! Isn't that exciting.
[30-May-2015 20:14:22]  <IllFlower> So do you want to ask Myaa a few questions?
[30-May-2015 20:14:36]  <Rig> Unless anyone has other avenues they'd like to take?
[30-May-2015 20:14:55]  <Calica> Myaa is probably the best lead, I guess
[30-May-2015 20:14:56]  <Icon> I... can't think of anything else? :v
[30-May-2015 20:15:57]  <IllFlower> All right, why don't we go do that?
[30-May-2015 20:16:17]  <Rig> Sounds good to me.
[30-May-2015 20:16:49]  <BGTB2005> sounds like a plan
[30-May-2015 20:18:25]  <IllFlower> Myaa's base of operations is a slightly disused basement practice space. There's a drum kit in the center of the room, and a couple of guitars against the wall. Odd, since Myaa doesn't have fingers to play the guitar with.
[30-May-2015 20:18:40]  <Calica> he's trying to organize a rock band of initiates
[30-May-2015 20:18:43]  <IllFlower> At least the adjustable music stools are nice.
[30-May-2015 20:19:40]  <IllFlower> The Conservators find Myaa staring intently at a drum practice pad when they arrive.
[30-May-2015 20:19:59]  <Calica> So Myaa is zeroplusalpha? :p
[30-May-2015 20:20:17]  <Icon> !!
[30-May-2015 20:20:50]  * Rig spends a minute just picturing this catlike thing staring intently at a practice pad.

[30-May-2015 20:22:46]  <IllFlower> Anyway, someone should probably say something.
[30-May-2015 20:22:51]  <Rig> "Myaa," Kazuki starts, wondering if they're interupting some kind of practice session.
[30-May-2015 20:23:11]  <IllFlower> He doesn't seem to respond.
[30-May-2015 20:23:25]  <Rig> We should try the universal language of music.
[30-May-2015 20:23:37]  <Rig> Everyone pick an instrument and roll heart and acutiy.
[30-May-2015 20:23:40]  <Rig> *acuity
[30-May-2015 20:23:43]  <BGTB2005> pfff

[30-May-2015 20:25:54]  <IllFlower> Kazuki takes a nearby drum stick and gently taps Myaa on the head.
[30-May-2015 20:26:11]  <Rig> Not exactly a musical intro.
[30-May-2015 20:27:09]  <IllFlower> "Hm?" Myaa says, looking up at the initiates.
[30-May-2015 20:27:16]  <IllFlower> "Oh, sorry. It was a bit loud. I didn't realize anyone had come in."
[30-May-2015 20:27:38]  <Calica> so is this a delusional familiar?
[30-May-2015 20:27:54]  <Icon> Yes.
[30-May-2015 20:28:02]  <IllFlower> Maybe it's all beyond the range of human hearing.
[30-May-2015 20:28:07]  <BGTB2005> maybe he's wearing ear buds?
[30-May-2015 20:28:54]  <IllFlower> (Hikari finds a record player with an LP of "Ultraacoustic Serenades for Dogs" spinning on the turntable.)
[30-May-2015 20:28:56]  <Rig> "It's okay," Kazuki says cautiously. "We're Conservators," Kazuki says and briefly introduces the team."
[30-May-2015 20:29:14]  <Calica> briefly introducing the team.  important business
[30-May-2015 20:29:26]  <Rig> We were hoping you could answer some questions about your recent recruits."

[30-May-2015 20:30:39]  <IllFlower> "That won't be a problem," Myaa says.
[30-May-2015 20:32:32]  <Rig> brb, but carry on without me
[30-May-2015 20:33:59]  <Rig> Good job carrying on without me.
[30-May-2015 20:34:08]  <Calica> "Your most recent recruits, as well as Chiaki Hikami who you're targeting, have all been tied to a particular school."
[30-May-2015 20:38:01]  <IllFlower> Sorry, just a moment.
[30-May-2015 20:40:14]  <IllFlower> Myaa tilts his head quizzically. "Hikami, yes... what do you mean, 'tied to a particular school'?"
[30-May-2015 20:42:39]  <BGTB2005> didn't they have different familiars?
[30-May-2015 20:43:12]  <IllFlower> I don't know if I ever actually *said* that, but yeah.

[30-May-2015 20:44:09]  <Rig> I probably forgot that.
[30-May-2015 20:44:22]  <Rig> It was 5 months ago.
[30-May-2015 20:45:04]  <BGTB2005> anyways

[30-May-2015 20:51:36]  <Calica> (I'm waiting for someone else to comment because it feels like someone other than Ayako should this time around)
[30-May-2015 20:53:15]  <BGTB2005> (I think Kazuki would know more about the Order's hierarchy and would be better at getting information, but i don't know if that's really possibly without raising too much suspicion)
[30-May-2015 20:53:18]  <Rig> "Why are you recruiting from a school with such a history?"
[30-May-2015 20:53:35]  *** Haruspex <~Glossina@66.96.79.231> has quit IRC (Quit: leaving)
[30-May-2015 20:54:40]  <IllFlower> "I was speaking to Hikami before all this happened. If she expresses interest, it's not my place to decline."
[30-May-2015 20:55:16]  <IllFlower> Myaa tries to be diplomatic, but his tone is vaguely defensive.
[30-May-2015 20:56:03]  <Rig> "I'm curious though, how do you decide who you approach about becoming an initiate." Kazuki tries to be friendly and disarm the familiar. "I didn't have all the pagentry of a formal recruitment."
[30-May-2015 21:00:34]  <IllFlower> "We try to make determinations on the basis of magical potential. You can think of us as sensors, in a way. We collect data, and approach recruits after that data is interpreted by the Prophets."
[30-May-2015 21:01:24]  <Rig> Kazuki nods thoughtfully. "And the Prophet's pick who you should approach?"
[30-May-2015 21:02:36]  <IllFlower> "Essentially."
[30-May-2015 21:03:48]  <Rig> Hm, I guess we could just ask him who he reports to.
[30-May-2015 21:04:41]  <Calica> Or at least who chose Chiaki
[30-May-2015 21:05:36]  <Icon> Or why they're bothering with the school? Or all of them
[30-May-2015 21:06:09]  <Rig> "Can you tell us which Prophet picked Chiaki?"
[30-May-2015 21:07:47]  <IllFlower> "We're not told about those details," Myaa says. "Only a general determination from the group of Prophets responsible for new initiates."
[30-May-2015 21:08:56]  <Rig> The most formal familiar yet.
[30-May-2015 21:09:25]  <Rig> I don't think we're likely to get anything else here unless you guys want to press?
[30-May-2015 21:10:01]  <BGTB2005> sounds like a conflict?
[30-May-2015 21:10:26]  <Rig> I dunno if Myaa knows enough for a conflict to be justified.
[30-May-2015 21:10:46]  <Calica> A conflict could be nice.
[30-May-2015 21:11:33]  <IllFlower> What would the objective be?
[30-May-2015 21:11:57]  <Calica> It'd really be the information but I guess Myaa doesn't actually have that
[30-May-2015 21:12:52]  <IllFlower> Unfortunately.
[30-May-2015 21:13:34]  <BGTB2005> unless we could find out by simply asking, I guess the objective would be 'learning which prophet Myaa reports to'?
[30-May-2015 21:13:42]  <IllFlower> If you're feeling reckless you can be direct and ask about a very particular person.
[30-May-2015 21:14:07]  <Calica> Luckily, Rin is always feeling reckless.
[30-May-2015 21:14:25]  <BGTB2005> Hikari too I guess
[30-May-2015 21:14:39]  *** eriophora <~Christine@c-73-181-245-125.hsd1.wa.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Quit)
[30-May-2015 21:16:04]  <Icon> Yes.
[30-May-2015 21:16:56]  <IllFlower> You're all pretty patient for such reckless people. :p
[30-May-2015 21:17:06]  <Rig> Very patient. :P
[30-May-2015 21:17:12]  <BGTB2005> After a moment, Rin speaks up again. "Which prophet do you report to?"
[30-May-2015 21:17:18]  <Rig> I dunno if it's worth a conflict, but you can go ahead.
[30-May-2015 21:17:31]  <Calica> I'm waiting for someone else because I feel like Ayako's probably the most unsure about this, and BGT is a slow typer.
[30-May-2015 21:17:49]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: That's essentially the same question expressed differently.
[30-May-2015 21:18:20]  <BGTB2005> ...I was hoping different wording would get more information(?)
[30-May-2015 21:18:33]  <IllFlower> When I say "a very particular person," I mean names. Which would be pretty reckless. But hey.
[30-May-2015 21:19:22]  <Rig> I think it'd be better to go around Myaa and search for evidence elsewhere. Or maybe go make sure Chiaki doesn't enlist.
[30-May-2015 21:20:17]  <BGTB2005> we could probably have Hikari tie Chiaki down somewhere
[30-May-2015 21:20:24]  <Icon> Oooh, actively forcing down more initiates?
[30-May-2015 21:20:27]  <Rig> Whoa.
[30-May-2015 21:20:29]  <Icon> Bad timing
[30-May-2015 21:20:39]  <Icon> I blame BGTB2005 for ninja'ing me
[30-May-2015 21:20:46]  <Calica> I see what game BGT and Icon want to play :p
[30-May-2015 21:21:04]  <IllFlower> It involves those handcuffs, doesn't it.
[30-May-2015 21:21:36]  <Icon> No! I was thinking of how we wer fighting with those bozos from sessions back and we pissed them off. Okay that wasn't quite convincing them not to become initiates but still
[30-May-2015 21:21:40]  <Icon> IllFlower: I am not Hikari
[30-May-2015 21:22:16]  <IllFlower> Uh-huh.
[30-May-2015 21:22:36]  <Icon> Jussayin'.
[30-May-2015 21:22:47]  <IllFlower> Do you want to try and convince Myaa not to pursue Chiaki, at least?
[30-May-2015 21:22:56]  <Rig> That might be worthwhile.
[30-May-2015 21:23:28]  <Icon> Sounds conflict-worthy, though I'm not sure Myaa ultimately has to listen to some weirdos?
[30-May-2015 21:23:37]  <Icon> And Hikari.
[30-May-2015 21:24:13]  <Calica> I think Conservators lie over Familiars in the heirarchy
[30-May-2015 21:24:23]  <Icon> Oh, right.
[30-May-2015 21:24:57]  <Rig> If we can prevent Myaa from recruiting from the school that might be a start.
[30-May-2015 21:24:58]  <BGTB2005> I think the prophets could overrule us though
[30-May-2015 21:25:13]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Sure, but it's better than nothing.
[30-May-2015 21:25:16]  <Rig> Probably, but that'd mean showing their hand.
[30-May-2015 21:25:42]  <Calica> "We do think that, given the circumstances, you should hold off on recruiting from the school until we've solved the murders of the two initiates."
[30-May-2015 21:27:06]  <IllFlower> "Should I take that as an order issued on behalf of the Conservators?"
[30-May-2015 21:28:44]  <IllFlower> "Under the auspices of," whatever.
[30-May-2015 21:29:06]  <Rig> Kazuki looks to Ayako briefly before nodding to Myaa. "Yes, that is an order."
[30-May-2015 21:29:46]  <Rig> I keep almost spelling Maya.
[30-May-2015 21:31:02]  <IllFlower> "Understood. I'll terminate my contact with Chiaki Hikami for now."
[30-May-2015 21:31:43]  <Rig> "Thank you. That'll be everything for now," Kazuki says stiffly. He thought Shii was weird, but Myaa is unsettling on a different level.
[30-May-2015 21:33:50]  <IllFlower> Or just efficient!
[30-May-2015 21:34:14]  <Rig> Yes. The staring at a practice pad was effeciently weird.
[30-May-2015 21:34:25]  <Calica> Rig: It's the most efficient way to enjoy music.
[30-May-2015 21:34:27]  <Rig> Where to next?
[30-May-2015 21:35:36]  <BGTB2005> I guess we could try observing the guy at Chiaki's school?
[30-May-2015 21:35:45]  <Calica> I don't have any better ideas
[30-May-2015 21:36:13]  <Icon> Let's Sta - Investigate!
[30-May-2015 21:36:29]  <Rig> I was thinking that or maybe tracking down some Prophets and asking them about how recruiting is done or letting Chiaki know she's not really up for initiation anymore (because of us)
[30-May-2015 21:40:16]  <BGTB2005> If the conservators are going to get some sleep between now and not-stalking the suspicious guy or whatever our next course of action is, I was thinking Rin was planning on spending the night at Chiaki's
[30-May-2015 21:40:58]  <Rig> That sounds like a decent way to get her caught up.
[30-May-2015 21:42:20]  <Icon> Sleepover.
[30-May-2015 21:42:27]  <IllFlower> Fanservice!
[30-May-2015 21:42:32]  <Icon> Uh
[30-May-2015 21:42:34]  <Rig> Beach episode!
[30-May-2015 21:42:48]  <IllFlower> So what's the plan?
[30-May-2015 21:42:55]  <Calica> What conflict level does 'pillow fight' go under?
[30-May-2015 21:43:11]  <Rig> Rin catches up Chiaki and we prep to do some surveiling 
[30-May-2015 21:43:15]  <IllFlower> You can cause concussions with those things, man.
[30-May-2015 21:43:23]  <Rig> So, d10 fallout?
[30-May-2015 21:43:35]  <Rig> Pillows are magical weapons.
[30-May-2015 21:43:36]  <Icon> RIP everyone defeated by Hikari's amazing skills
[30-May-2015 21:44:02]  <Calica> Rig: An emgirl that fights with a pillow, her transformation looks like pajamas.
[30-May-2015 21:44:11]  <BGTB2005> glorious way to go out, though
[30-May-2015 21:44:26]  <Calica> anyways, uh, yeah, we should probably inform Chiaki?
[30-May-2015 21:44:45]  <Rig> I'm reminded that I still haven't described Kazuki's transform.
[30-May-2015 21:45:06]  <BGTB2005> I'm running with him looking like Ikuto
[30-May-2015 21:45:37]  <BGTB2005> if only because I don't really have any other catboys to reference
[30-May-2015 21:46:07]  <IllFlower> Rin spends the night over at Chiaki's place, filling her in on what's transpired.
[30-May-2015 21:46:32]  <IllFlower> The Conservators meet in Shii's lair the next morning to construct a surveillance plan.
[30-May-2015 21:46:56]  <IllFlower> Shii, unusually, isn't there.
[30-May-2015 21:47:04]  <Rig> He's in a band with Myaa.
[30-May-2015 21:47:07]  <Rig> They started touring.
[30-May-2015 21:47:27]  <IllFlower> Shii's a she.
[30-May-2015 21:47:28]  <Calica> thousands of magical girls, their wish to be to go backstage
[30-May-2015 21:47:33]  <IllFlower> They even sound the same.
[30-May-2015 21:47:44]  <Rig> I've been pronouncing it wrong then.
[30-May-2015 21:47:55]  <Rig> I thought the s was silent.
[30-May-2015 21:48:20]  <Calica> she actually spells it in romaji as Sii
[30-May-2015 21:48:29]  <IllFlower> How do you want to go about all this?
[30-May-2015 21:48:55]  <Rig> Do we know anything other than "There is a creepy middle aged dude stalking around the school?"
[30-May-2015 21:51:29]  <IllFlower> Maybe not...
[30-May-2015 21:51:33]  <Rig> We could just sit around the school and wait to see him?
[30-May-2015 21:51:51]  <Rig> Extending conflict to catch a predator.
[30-May-2015 21:52:28]  <Calica> Is Shii's absence supposed to be significant?
[30-May-2015 21:52:32]  <IllFlower> I have no particular objection to that.
[30-May-2015 21:52:49]  <Calica> But yeah, running a stakeout like we did back in the first arc could work
[30-May-2015 21:53:02]  <BGTB2005> ("Have a seat over there." raise 3 3?)
[30-May-2015 21:55:08]  <Rig> Okay, so, we just wait and watch the school?
[30-May-2015 21:55:59]  <IllFlower> As the Conservators look at a map to try and figure out good locations for a stakeout, Shii suddenly appears on her desk with a louder-than-normal snap.
[30-May-2015 21:56:11]  <Rig> Fiesty.
[30-May-2015 21:56:23]  <IllFlower> EI. Like Feist.
[30-May-2015 21:56:35]  <Rig> Spelling is dumb.
[30-May-2015 21:57:36]  <Rig> Kazuki looks up at Shii. "Is everything all right?"
[30-May-2015 21:59:20]  <Calica> "What's going on?"
[30-May-2015 21:59:26]  <IllFlower> "Things are a bit up in arms at headquarters. A familiar retired overnight and there's been a scramble to reassign his charges to new familiars."
[30-May-2015 22:00:06]  <Rig> Kazuki raises an eyebrow. "Anyone we would know?"
[30-May-2015 22:01:31]  <IllFlower> "Someone named Myaa. He had six or seven initiates under his wing."
[30-May-2015 22:01:58]  <Calica> Ayako looks around at the other initiates.
[30-May-2015 22:02:27]  <Rig> Kazuki isn't particularly surprised. "Why did he retire? Wait, you can retire?"
[30-May-2015 22:04:05]  <BGTB2005> I think it's a euphemism?
[30-May-2015 22:04:26]  <IllFlower> "No familiar sticks around forever. Some of them make that decision."
[30-May-2015 22:04:49]  <IllFlower> Shii's voice suggests that this is far from the first time she's seen this happen.
[30-May-2015 22:05:10]  <IllFlower> "They usually don't have this many initiates, though. One at most."
[30-May-2015 22:06:48]  <Calica> "Did Myaa say anything about why he did this?"
[30-May-2015 22:08:48]  <IllFlower> "It'd be remarkably abrupt if he hadn't, but I don't know."
[30-May-2015 22:10:34]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: You might be on to something...
[30-May-2015 22:11:44]  <Calica> It's a euphemism in the same way Nyoma being "released" was a euphemism
[30-May-2015 22:12:23]  <Rig> "What is going to happen to the initiates that Myaa was in charge of?"
[30-May-2015 22:13:22]  <IllFlower> Shii mentioned they're getting reassigned.
[30-May-2015 22:15:16]  <Rig> Hang on, a storm just blew in and drove rain sideways into my room. Gotta dry everything. I wanted to ask about the people Myaa was recruiting
[30-May-2015 22:15:27]  <Icon> :I
[30-May-2015 22:15:46]  <BGTB2005> I need to go get dinner at some point
[30-May-2015 22:16:06]  <Rig>  Okay. Sorta dry now.
[30-May-2015 22:16:13]  <Rig> So, different question.
[30-May-2015 22:16:14]  <IllFlower> We'll close in a bit.
[30-May-2015 22:16:32]  <Rig> "Did Myaa have any people they were initiating? What happens to them?"
[30-May-2015 22:17:41]  <IllFlower> "That's up to how much the Prophets want a potential initiate, I suppose. Why do you ask?"
[30-May-2015 22:18:33]  <Rig> "We went to speak to Myaa yesterday," Kazuki comes clean. "Myaa was in charge of the recruitment of one of Rin's friends. We were concerned."
[30-May-2015 22:20:08]  <IllFlower> "Wait, the one that was wondering whether or not to become an initiate and came to Rin about it?"
[30-May-2015 22:20:22]  <Rig> Kazuki nods.
[30-May-2015 22:20:24]  <BGTB2005> "Yes."
[30-May-2015 22:21:49]  <IllFlower> Shii is silent for a while.
[30-May-2015 22:22:25]  <IllFlower> "This friend, she was a classmate of the recent murder victims, no?"
[30-May-2015 22:22:46]  <Rig> "That's correct."
[30-May-2015 22:24:13]  <IllFlower> "Something is up," Shii says. "This pattern doesn't make sense.
[30-May-2015 22:24:52]  <IllFlower> "The fact that there were still any familiars trying to make contracts there doesn't make sense."
[30-May-2015 22:25:07]  <Rig> "I'm glad we agree."
[30-May-2015 22:25:37]  <Rig> "Who would be capable of making them continue contracting there?
[30-May-2015 22:25:39]  <Rig> "
[30-May-2015 22:25:50]  <Icon> (I have not known what to say, sorry.)
[30-May-2015 22:25:51]  <IllFlower> "Are you suspecting someone?"
[30-May-2015 22:26:38]  <Rig> Kazuki doesn't know if he should reveal their suspicions even to Shii. He's technically part of their team, but it feels like a breach to tell him.
[30-May-2015 22:26:44]  <Calica> her
[30-May-2015 22:26:49]  <Rig> Yeah
[30-May-2015 22:27:18]  <Rig> "We were hoping Myaa could point us in the right direction."
[30-May-2015 22:27:19]  <IllFlower> This gets funnier when you remember Kazuki is gay.
[30-May-2015 22:29:47]  <IllFlower> "Familiars are entitled to make their own decisions, but they can be overridden by the Prophets.
[30-May-2015 22:30:03]  <IllFlower> "More specifically, the conclave responsible for initiations. I don't remember the name."
[30-May-2015 22:31:14]  <Calica> "Is it possible that someone on this conclave could be corrupted?  If so, what should be done?"
[30-May-2015 22:33:28]  <IllFlower> Shii's eyes widen.
[30-May-2015 22:33:45]  <IllFlower> "I... I'd suggest speaking to a trusted Prophet, perhaps."
[30-May-2015 22:34:11]  <Rig> Kazuki sighs. This is just one big family reunion.
[30-May-2015 22:34:46]  <IllFlower> Hey, Ayako knows one too.
[30-May-2015 22:35:05]  <Rig> I'm wondering if anyone can be considered trusted.
[30-May-2015 22:35:21]  <IllFlower> paranoia paranoia paranoia
[30-May-2015 22:35:46]  * IllFlower hits Calica with "stop apologizing" fan
[30-May-2015 22:36:07]  <Calica> IllFlower: I deliberately avoided saying "sorry" in that private message!
[30-May-2015 22:36:38]  <IllFlower> ">_>" totally implies it.
[30-May-2015 22:37:39]  <BGTB2005> Rin would probably be more inclined to go with the Miyahara
[30-May-2015 22:38:18]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@104.204.220.179> has joined #madokamadness
[30-May-2015 22:40:13]  <IllFlower> Anybody?
[30-May-2015 22:40:16]  <Rig> "Who do we trust enough to approach?"
[30-May-2015 22:41:06]  <IllFlower> Good question.
[30-May-2015 22:41:22]  <IllFlower> Ayako does have 1d8 Yurika.
[30-May-2015 22:41:39]  <Calica> Does Kazuki remotely trust his father
[30-May-2015 22:41:57]  <Rig> Yeah, he does, but he doesn't really want to reveal the secret his mother told him.
[30-May-2015 22:42:20]  <IllFlower> That would be treble awkward.
[30-May-2015 22:44:59]  <BGTB2005> yeah I think going with Yurika is probably better?
[30-May-2015 22:45:23]  <Calica> yeah probably
[30-May-2015 22:45:28]  <Rig> I agree for now.
[30-May-2015 22:45:48]  <Icon> Makes sense to me, least she's someone.
[30-May-2015 22:45:57]  <IllFlower> All right.
[30-May-2015 22:46:19]  <IllFlower> I think this is a good stopping point. Remarkably low tension given what else has happened this session, but hey, whatever.
[30-May-2015 22:46:25]  <Rig> Sorry.
[30-May-2015 22:46:42]  <Calica> <_<
[30-May-2015 22:46:48]  * IllFlower menacingly raises fan at Rig
[30-May-2015 22:46:49]  <Rig> Storm kinda fucked up my shit.
[30-May-2015 22:47:05]  <IllFlower> Nah, it's already been close to four hours anyway.
[30-May-2015 22:47:17]  <BGTB2005> I don't think Kazuki's done anything cold this session?
[30-May-2015 22:47:32]  <Rig> Shit!
[30-May-2015 22:47:33]  <IllFlower> I didn't call him cold last session either, so Rig already lost that one.
[30-May-2015 22:47:38]  <Rig> ;-;
[30-May-2015 22:47:46]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that's right! Double shit!
[30-May-2015 22:48:37]  <IllFlower> Anyway, thanks for playing. We'll pick up again next week.
[30-May-2015 22:48:41]  <IllFlower> Until then!
