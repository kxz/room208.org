@time=2014-07-26T20:13:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So last we left off, Kazuki was busy being comatose.
@time=2014-07-26T20:13:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, and something about a barrier.
@time=2014-07-26T20:13:58.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, Hikari brought it up to Ayako, but she was all "Eh, later, now's not the time." :p
@time=2014-07-26T20:14:12.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Which, is true...
@time=2014-07-26T20:14:52.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako marked down where it was on a train map so that we could go back to it.  P

@time=2014-07-26T20:14:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You guys are good at this "investigating" thing, aren't you.
@time=2014-07-26T20:15:11.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Welllllll.
@time=2014-07-26T20:15:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In any case, "later" is now. So what say you?
@time=2014-07-26T20:16:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, another barrier blocking off a building?
@time=2014-07-26T20:16:51.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We’ve had good luck with those, right?
@time=2014-07-26T20:17:27.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mai's went alright.
@time=2014-07-26T20:17:29.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Right, we already met up with Mai and got some information from her. So we could go back and try our luck there.
@time=2014-07-26T20:18:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or there's the whole guard thing.
@time=2014-07-26T20:18:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You probably won't die.
@time=2014-07-26T20:18:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In case that helps you make your decision.
@time=2014-07-26T20:20:09.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I vote for investigating the barrier
@time=2014-07-26T20:20:12.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Me too.
@time=2014-07-26T20:20:25.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I've wanted to.
@time=2014-07-26T20:20:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :For so long!
@time=2014-07-26T20:20:57.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :what do you think she's so hyped for, IllFlower?
@time=2014-07-26T20:21:20.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let's go!
@time=2014-07-26T20:22:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's bright and early in the morning when the Conservators set back out for Miyahama and the building where they saw the barrier the previous day.
@time=2014-07-26T20:23:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Finding it again proves surprisingly easy. The sunlight reflects off the visible surfaces of the magical wall, causing them to stand out even from behind the place's shuttered windows.
@time=2014-07-26T20:24:34.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“It brightens the place up,” Kazuki comments.
@time=2014-07-26T20:25:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The lot itself is blocked off at ground level by fences and construction equipment. A large sign informs passers-by that the building is scheduled for demolition. The concrete exterior seems appropriately aged and gritty.
@time=2014-07-26T20:26:22.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :man, initiates really like using abandoned buildings
@time=2014-07-26T20:26:38.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd use one as my hideout.
@time=2014-07-26T20:26:48.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :They've got good taste.
@time=2014-07-26T20:26:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Is the barrier up against the building?
@time=2014-07-26T20:26:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or does it extend to the fence?
@time=2014-07-26T20:27:07.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :From how it was described last week, I assumed that the barrier was inside the building, but I could be wrong
@time=2014-07-26T20:27:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The barrier seems to cover just one part of a floor of the building. Probably an apartment.
@time=2014-07-26T20:28:43.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Makes them easy to find.
@time=2014-07-26T20:28:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“Should we go ring the bell?”
@time=2014-07-26T20:29:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :True to form, there don't appear to be any workers on site today. The demolition seems to have been delayed for some bureaucratic reason or another.
@time=2014-07-26T20:30:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: Kazuki jokes, but he finds the doorbells have all been stripped already.
@time=2014-07-26T20:30:52.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Effecient.
@time=2014-07-26T20:31:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki eyes the removed doorbells. “I don’t have much hope for the elevators either."
@time=2014-07-26T20:31:26.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Too bad only one of us can fly."
@time=2014-07-26T20:31:32.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin considers just flying up to the barrier
@time=2014-07-26T20:32:21.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“You can fly?” Kazuki asks Ayako. “Maybe you should scout ahead?”
@time=2014-07-26T20:32:31.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I can."
@time=2014-07-26T20:32:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The elevator doesn't work, but it looks like there's a scissor lift outside that the construction crew's left behind.
@time=2014-07-26T20:32:50.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm not sure I'd trust Rin to scout ahead."
@time=2014-07-26T20:33:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And there's always the stairs. Seven floors up isn't *that* high, right?
@time=2014-07-26T20:34:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“How about we split up? Ayako and Rin will take the outside of the building and Hikari and I will take the stairs?”
@time=2014-07-26T20:34:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, Kazuki might get a little winded. He's only got 3 Bd.
@time=2014-07-26T20:34:30.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Sure, I'm fine with that."
@time=2014-07-26T20:34:43.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :whereas the rest of us have a whopping 4 Bd
@time=2014-07-26T20:35:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“We’ll text you when we’re in position,” Kazuki says and heads for the stairs.

@time=2014-07-26T20:36:42.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'll try to make sure Rin doesn't do anything rash.  Follow me, Rin; the lift is this way."
@time=2014-07-26T20:37:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Up on the seventh floor, the barrier resembles nothing so much as a wall of tightly woven reflective fabric. The door and all of the windows are blocked by the same pattern.
@time=2014-07-26T20:38:18.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Rin works best... when she has someone to keep her in line. We still have trouble with that." Hikari mulls over what to say, before continuing. "On our last assignment she attacked someone without good cause."
@time=2014-07-26T20:38:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All of the other rooms are devoid of people, and some even of interior walls and fixtures. Of course. The place's being demolished, after all.
@time=2014-07-26T20:39:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki nods, but keeps his worries to himself. They’ve reached the barrier. The woven magic feels strangely intense to him. He’s never seen initiates use something so complex.
@time=2014-07-26T20:40:17.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He sends a quick text to Ayako, “No way in on this side"
@time=2014-07-26T20:41:20.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako responds "Same here, but I think Rin's considering just setting the whole barrier on fire"
@time=2014-07-26T20:42:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“No” is Kazuki’s response to that particular idea
@time=2014-07-26T20:42:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha.
@time=2014-07-26T20:42:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :To the point.

@time=2014-07-26T20:43:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, someone's gotta do something!
@time=2014-07-26T20:44:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki reaches out with his senses and tries to sense magic inside the barrier, but the whole thing seems to radiate too much energy to see through.

@time=2014-07-26T20:48:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki reaches out again, physically this time, and runs his hands around the barrier just inches from the surface. He uses slight pulses of magic to probe for weaknesses.
@time=2014-07-26T20:49:06.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako pulls out her notebook and begins chanting something, pushing her own pulses of magic at the barrier, and probably creating some sort of neat resonance pattern.

@time=2014-07-26T22:35:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako always got the impression Yurika was looking down on her, something like that.
