@time=2014-09-13T19:22:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari is attending to an unconscious Ayako inside. Youichi's made his way out to where Miu's crumpled form lies in the middle of the parking lot.

@time=2014-09-13T22:44:00.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari got a bit too caught up in making sure those that disobeyed stopped disobeying, which... well, not effectively stopping Ayako's powers would be the conclusion of that.

@time=2014-09-13T22:45:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: Anything on the other experience item?
@time=2014-09-13T22:46:06.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :1d6 Wants to keep the order? This being everything from, like, "Oh shit Ayako let loose" to "Okay disobeying the Order is WRONG, but the team comes first."
@time=2014-09-13T22:46:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was thinking that Rin could stand to be more assertive with her teammates, but then I remembered how she basically started wailing on Kazuki halfway through...
@time=2014-09-13T22:46:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ahah.
@time=2014-09-13T22:46:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: That's a little vague.
@time=2014-09-13T22:46:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hm.. yeah, it is.
@time=2014-09-13T22:47:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thinking from Hikari's perspective, I could see her going "I need to make sure Ayako - or any of my teammates - never does anything like that again."
@time=2014-09-13T22:48:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: /me looks at "takes charge"
@time=2014-09-13T22:48:41.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah she's, in her self-righteous way, been trying to not let things get dumb. While of course letting others know that they're wrong.
@time=2014-09-13T22:48:55.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Because they are.
@time=2014-09-13T22:49:01.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin might be a tad irritated over being left out in part of Hikari's summary of events, but I'm not sure how that would affect her relationship with Hikari
@time=2014-09-13T22:49:39.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, Hikari also got in the way of her punching out Kazuki.
@time=2014-09-13T22:49:43.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Sad day that day.)
@time=2014-09-13T22:50:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: And maybe that relationship with Rin.
@time=2014-09-13T22:51:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: A simple way to think about it: The righteous judge both their allies and their enemies in equal measure.

@time=2014-09-13T22:51:41.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's more succinct than I can do. >_>;
@time=2014-09-13T22:51:45.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But, yeah.
@time=2014-09-13T22:52:17.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :more succinct than Hikari can do :p
@time=2014-09-13T22:52:41.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :1d6 The judge of situations? Or maybe there's a better way of putting it, but something that gets across her knowing what is actually up.
@time=2014-09-13T22:52:46.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: I tryyyyyyyyy.
@time=2014-09-13T22:52:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm just not good at speaking in general.
@time=2014-09-13T22:53:29.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was just referencing her intended mode of speaking already
@time=2014-09-13T22:53:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's the spirit in which I suggested "reponsible for my comrades' actions."
@time=2014-09-13T22:53:40.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :which as you mentioned is a bit overly formal
@time=2014-09-13T22:53:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Oh, misunderstood. >__>;
@time=2014-09-13T22:54:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The last thing you need when you're on a righteous streak is an unrighteous ally undermining you.
@time=2014-09-13T22:54:43.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :too bad she's surrounded by them
@time=2014-09-13T22:55:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: That... yeah, I get what you're getting at, now. Oops. So perhaps that die, and up one of her stats (Ht) or her relationship with Ayako?
@time=2014-09-13T22:55:59.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Upping Bd doesn't make sense. Wl I could see but not as much as that. Acuity... she's no Ayako, lol.
@time=2014-09-13T22:56:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: "I can help people [and not just be a bundle of rage] 1d6"
@time=2014-09-13T22:56:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: I'd go for the relationship with Ayako.
@time=2014-09-13T22:57:28.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: I was leaning towards that, even if I wanna up a stat.
@time=2014-09-13T22:57:40.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So that works. Even if Relationships don't seem to get pulled in much.
@time=2014-09-13T22:57:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mean, I agree with you that the stat bumps don't make all that much sense.
@time=2014-09-13T22:57:59.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm not sure if it's distinct enough from '1d6 Stands up for others'
@time=2014-09-13T22:58:28.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well with the trait IF mentioned, the not just a bundle of rage is important
@time=2014-09-13T22:58:44.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :since there's helping people by healing them, and helping people by pummelling a bully
@time=2014-09-13T22:58:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: Well, the intended nuance is "sometimes violence is not the answer," haha.
@time=2014-09-13T22:59:27.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin is improving! While Ayako isn't! Kazuki continues to be a slimy jerk, and Hikari the sole bastion of righteousness! Exclamation marks!
@time=2014-09-13T22:59:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe notching "if it doesn't work, use more" or "sticks to her strengths" down might communicate that.
@time=2014-09-13T23:00:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Were you considering anything?
@time=2014-09-13T23:00:24.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: So, yeah. Adding that trait, and upping her Relationship with Ayako.
@time=2014-09-13T23:00:36.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: Still not sure, even with the hints you gave.
@time=2014-09-13T23:00:40.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :1d6 Responsible for the lack of righteousness
@time=2014-09-13T23:00:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: Done.

@time=2014-09-13T23:02:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Her lack of confidence in her own self-control might lead her to hold back her magical abilityies.

@time=2014-09-13T23:02:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So one of those traits might lose a die, or shrink to d8.
@time=2014-09-13T23:03:11.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hmm, well, I think she is backsliding/deteriorating/etc a bit, it remains to be seen what comes next.  I think the "holding back" thing makes a lot of sense.
@time=2014-09-13T23:03:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I should remove the wand now that she doesn't have it anymore, eh.
@time=2014-09-13T23:03:30.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not as if she needs it. ;)

@time=2014-09-13T23:04:48.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: Because I am Slow, I just got the other implication of "responsibility" in her new Trait. By which I mean the whole "Of course Hikari would think she is" deal.
@time=2014-09-13T23:04:55.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sry for slowness.
@time=2014-09-13T23:04:57.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: Maybe.  We can cross that bridge when we come to it, lol
@time=2014-09-13T23:04:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, I just crossed it out so it's obvious it's gone.
@time=2014-09-13T23:05:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, so Alicia and Rig are done. BGTB2005 still needs one more change, ponicalica two.
@time=2014-09-13T23:06:30.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think I'll take 2d10→2d8 on dangerous magic, as she feels her control over same is deteriorating, etc.
@time=2014-09-13T23:07:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mm, I thought that was more for when other people used it against her.
@time=2014-09-13T23:07:33.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hmm, true, maybe it should be the other d10 trait
@time=2014-09-13T23:07:52.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :3d10→3d8 on that one, actually, yeah
@time=2014-09-13T23:08:09.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :since the knowledge is still there but has become less reliable
@time=2014-09-13T23:08:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Done.

@time=2014-09-13T23:15:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You could drop the 1d4 relationship.

@time=2014-09-13T23:18:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hm, yeah, I'm actually partial to erasing the 1d4 with Rin.
@time=2014-09-13T23:18:18.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, I think I like that idea too
@time=2014-09-13T23:18:30.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It makes sense.
@time=2014-09-13T23:18:44.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not like their relationship improved anyway.
@time=2014-09-13T23:18:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: That being said, going 1d4 -> 2d4 Kazuki makes sense for Rin...
@time=2014-09-13T23:19:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :If you don't want to do the mellowing trait adjustments I proposed earlier.
@time=2014-09-13T23:19:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Depends on whether she's more affected by saving a girl or hating Kazuki.
@time=2014-09-13T23:20:00.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin never mellows. She just finds more efficient ways to stick it to The Man.

@time=2014-09-13T23:20:55.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe both. "I sure hate Kazuki, but like I need that ass to do good."

@time=2014-09-13T23:23:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that's why I mentioned bumping down the other traits, since that's the inverse of "if it doesn't work, use more" as far as I can tell.
@time=2014-09-13T23:23:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Adding a new trait works too, though.
@time=2014-09-13T23:23:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In fact, I think having both of those "opposite" traits for now might be a good illustration of an inner conflict on Rin's part, if that's the direction you want to go.
@time=2014-09-13T23:25:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Up to you.
@time=2014-09-13T23:25:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Scratched the 1d4 with Rin.
@time=2014-09-13T23:25:41.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think I'll do that
@time=2014-09-13T23:25:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :New trait?
@time=2014-09-13T23:25:50.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-09-13T23:26:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Cool.
@time=2014-09-13T23:26:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, I think that handles everything. Thanks for playing, everyone!
