[13-Sep-2014 19:07:39]  <BGTB2005> also I still have fallout
[13-Sep-2014 19:08:14]  <ponicalica> from saving whatserface
[13-Sep-2014 19:08:15]  <ponicalica> er
[13-Sep-2014 19:08:17]  <ponicalica> Miu, right?
[13-Sep-2014 19:08:35]  <IllFlower> Right, let's do something about that.
[13-Sep-2014 19:08:38]  <BGTB2005> an XP and a long-term, plus the one XP from before that
[13-Sep-2014 19:09:35]  <IllFlower> As usual, one of the easy answers is "bump a stat."
[13-Sep-2014 19:09:43]  <BGTB2005> For the long-term, I was thinking adding a d4 to the relationship with Ayako?
[13-Sep-2014 19:09:59]  <IllFlower> (bump Ht, cough cough)
[13-Sep-2014 19:10:06]  <IllFlower> Okay, done.
[13-Sep-2014 19:10:09]  <Rig> So, where is everyone as of the end of last session?
[13-Sep-2014 19:10:50]  <IllFlower> Ayako and Hikari and maybe Youichi and probably nobody else are in the restaurant.
[13-Sep-2014 19:11:18]  <ponicalica> Ayako's passed out from too much magic and will wake up whenever it's narratively convenient.
[13-Sep-2014 19:11:20]  <IllFlower> Rin just saved Miu, Ritsuko's in tears or something, and Kazuki's busy smoking.
[13-Sep-2014 19:11:49]  <Rig> Kazuki should just walk up to Youichi and be like “That dissent is going real well.”
[13-Sep-2014 19:12:19]  <Alicia> Back.
[13-Sep-2014 19:12:24]  <Alicia> Thanks.
[13-Sep-2014 19:12:29]  <BGTB2005> for one of the XP I'd like to add a d6 relationship with Miu/Pyunpyun's rebellious initiates
[13-Sep-2014 19:12:54]  <IllFlower> Any one of them in particular?
[13-Sep-2014 19:12:59]  <IllFlower> Or just the whole group?
[13-Sep-2014 19:13:03]  <Alicia> Rig: Hikari's near the passed out Ayako in the dirtied up restaurant.
[13-Sep-2014 19:13:26]  <IllFlower> Oh, let's say a thunderstorm just rolled in out of nowhere. For dramatic effect.
[13-Sep-2014 19:13:42]  <ponicalica> man Ayako really fucked things up

[13-Sep-2014 19:16:31]  <BGTB2005> and for the last XP I'd like to bump a stat
[13-Sep-2014 19:16:52]  <IllFlower> *drumroll*
[13-Sep-2014 19:17:22]  <BGTB2005> Given Rin's actions so far, I guess Ht like you suggested earlier?
[13-Sep-2014 19:17:39]  <IllFlower> All wrapped up.
[13-Sep-2014 19:17:49]  <ponicalica> Ayako is now the most heartless Conservator in the cast
[13-Sep-2014 19:17:53]  <IllFlower> Poor girl.
[13-Sep-2014 19:18:06]  <IllFlower> Well, it's not like this is a new thing for her.
[13-Sep-2014 19:18:15]  <IllFlower> She's just more malicious than awkward now.
[13-Sep-2014 19:19:04]  <IllFlower> Okay, shall we open the curtains on the scene?
[13-Sep-2014 19:19:19]  <Alicia> Sure deal.
[13-Sep-2014 19:19:34]  <BGTB2005> I almost wanted to try bumping Rin's Ac, but I'm not sure if I would be able to justify it
[13-Sep-2014 19:19:49]  <IllFlower> Healing is an Ac thing.
[13-Sep-2014 19:20:03]  <IllFlower> But this works.
[13-Sep-2014 19:20:09]  <IllFlower> Anyway,
[13-Sep-2014 19:20:11]  <BGTB2005> yeah, let me get some popcorn
[13-Sep-2014 19:20:22]  <Rig> So, what’s the scene?
[13-Sep-2014 19:20:45]  <IllFlower> It's just started raining, the mid-afternoon sky turned dark enough to be evening.
[13-Sep-2014 19:21:26]  <IllFlower> Most everyone seems to have cleared out of the restaurant. One suspects the police may be on their way, but if so they're nowhere in sight quite yet.
[13-Sep-2014 19:22:03]  <IllFlower> Hikari is attending to an unconscious Ayako inside. Youichi's made his way out to where Miu's crumpled form lies in the middle of the parking lot.
[13-Sep-2014 19:22:46]  <IllFlower> Kazuki, for his part, simply stares at the scene from the nearby street, a mix of disbelief and scorn busy whirling around in his mind.
[13-Sep-2014 19:24:19]  <IllFlower> Slowly, Youichi and Ritsuko lift Miu onto their shoulders, bringing her out of the way of traffic. Rin staggers behind them, exhausted from the healing ritual she's just performed.
[13-Sep-2014 19:24:22]  <ponicalica> I'm pretty sure "a mix of disbelief and scorn" is basically his entire personality at this point
[13-Sep-2014 19:25:08]  <IllFlower> This is your scene.
[13-Sep-2014 19:26:16]  <Rig> Kazuki walks up to Youichi. The rain seems to part around him as he walks. “Is it still worth it? Is this what your dissent means?”
[13-Sep-2014 19:27:15]  <IllFlower> "I could ask you the same question. Is this what your Order demands?"
[13-Sep-2014 19:27:35]  <IllFlower> Youichi shifts under Miu's weight. "I guess there's no convincing either of us, though."
[13-Sep-2014 19:30:32]  <Rig> “I guess not,” Kazuki says. He looks toward the restaraunt. “The Order demands… well, order,” he smirks. Kazuki looks toward the exhausted Rin and considers his options. He planned to kill these initiates in the name of the order. Rin had planned to kill Yuuya for much the same reason.
[13-Sep-2014 19:31:34]  <Rig> “Leave, run, take your powers and your beliefs far from our reach.” Kazuki turns and walks toward the restaraunt.
[13-Sep-2014 19:32:38]  <Rig> (Objections to this?)
[13-Sep-2014 19:32:53]  <ponicalica> Ayako slowly wakes up, and turns to Hikari, still somewhat dazed.  "W--what happened here?  I sort of remember starting to confront them, but then everything goes fuzzy..."
[13-Sep-2014 19:33:00]  <IllFlower> Rig: None at all.
[13-Sep-2014 19:33:18]  <ponicalica> It's up to Hikari to decide what she wants to actually tell Ayako ;)
[13-Sep-2014 19:35:16]  <Rig> Kazuki enters the restaraunt. Remnants of the magical light have left scorches across surfaces and the broken glass reflects the natural light with faint glimmers. “Ayako….” he mumbles.
[13-Sep-2014 19:36:42]  <Rig> Alicia: Do you want to fill in Ayako/Kazuki on what the hell happened in the restaraunt?
[13-Sep-2014 19:37:07]  <Alicia> Hikari surveys the restaurant, while thinking over an answer. She turned the question over in her head. "Ayako, you..." she begins, as Kazuki enters.
[13-Sep-2014 19:37:37]  <Rig> “She?” he implores.
[13-Sep-2014 19:37:50]  <Alicia> "... hello, Kazuki." She begins quietly, her expression tied between concern and confusion.

[13-Sep-2014 19:39:17]  <Alicia> Hikari takes a deep breath in, letting Kazuki wait to hear. "She - Ayako, you... you began attacking the initiates. Miu  got thrown out of a window, and the others would have gotten hurt as well, had they not escaped..."
[13-Sep-2014 19:39:21]  *** IllFlowe1 is now known as IllFlower
[13-Sep-2014 19:39:26]  <IllFlower> I've got logs, don't worry.
[13-Sep-2014 19:39:54]  <IllFlower> Not dancing around the subject, are we.
[13-Sep-2014 19:40:05]  <Alicia> She looks from outside, then back in, before turning to Kazuki. "I know what you're thinking."
[13-Sep-2014 19:40:14]  <ponicalica> well she's definitely omitting an important detail, isn't she
[13-Sep-2014 19:40:33]  <Rig> “Then I don’t need to say it?” Kazuki asks.
[13-Sep-2014 19:40:56]  <Rig> He really can’t help him self though, “Can we actually complete a mission without blowing up a civilian business?”
[13-Sep-2014 19:41:34]  * BGTB2005 looks through logs
[13-Sep-2014 19:41:56]  <Alicia> "Yes, I'm sure you're all ready to tell us about... this mess. How we messed -" her face tenses in anger. "Kazuki, you wouldn't... Do you think we tried to do this!?"
[13-Sep-2014 19:42:16]  <Alicia> "Ayako lost control! I failed to help her calm down! And now you want to start with this?"
[13-Sep-2014 19:42:31]  <Rig> “Honestly, in the two missions I’ve been on since I’ve been assigned to this team we’ve completely annihilated the top floors of a hospital, nearly killed a soon-to-be prophet, started a magical fight in a family restaraunt and thrown a suspect we’re supposed to be capturing out of a window!”
[13-Sep-2014 19:42:41]  <Rig> “I don’t think being calm is the problem here.”
[13-Sep-2014 19:42:58]  <Rig> “I think the problem is that…” he pauses.
[13-Sep-2014 19:43:38]  <ponicalica> "I...what?  Again?"  Ayako has a horrified look on her face.
[13-Sep-2014 19:44:02]  <Rig> “It doesn’t matter what I think,” he says. “We need to report this to the Order and get out of here before police arrive.”
[13-Sep-2014 19:44:06]  <Alicia> Hikari goes silent. He's... not wrong about what happened.
[13-Sep-2014 19:44:21]  <IllFlower> Someone should tell Ayako that Miu is dead.
[13-Sep-2014 19:44:26]  <IllFlower> For the lulz.
[13-Sep-2014 19:45:04]  <Alicia> (Well, Hikari doesn't know. I mean, it's not like magical girls haven't lived through worse...)
[13-Sep-2014 19:46:24]  <IllFlower> And to think that this was supposed to be the arc where killing people wasn't going to be an option.
[13-Sep-2014 19:47:00]  <ponicalica> somewhere, Vince Baker is laughing
[13-Sep-2014 19:47:25]  <Rig> IllFlower: You should know that killing people is always an option.
[13-Sep-2014 19:47:25]  <Alicia> Hikari looks to Ayako, though responds to both. "I - yes."
[13-Sep-2014 19:47:33]  <Alicia> responds as if to*

[13-Sep-2014 19:49:07]  <Alicia> "We need to go, Ayako." She helps lift Ayako up, staring back at Kazuki.
[13-Sep-2014 19:49:17]  <IllFlower> Is anyone going to attend to Rin?
[13-Sep-2014 19:49:24]  <IllFlower> She's just kinda slumped over outside, last I checked.
[13-Sep-2014 19:50:09]  <Alicia> (I thought Rin was coming back in? And I figured the four would inevitably meet as they go about leaving...)
[13-Sep-2014 19:50:43]  <BGTB2005> that's what I was thinking too
[13-Sep-2014 19:50:49]  <ponicalica> "Mm."  Ayako gets on her own two feet, and regains her bearings after a bit of a wobble.  "Where's Rin?"
[13-Sep-2014 19:51:54]  <Rig> “She was outside,” Kazuki says. “She seemed kinda out of it.”
[13-Sep-2014 19:52:38]  <Rig> Kazuki heads back outside to find their remaining member.
[13-Sep-2014 19:52:54]  <Rig> Not sure what you want Rin to be doing or how out of it you want her to be, BGTB2005 
[13-Sep-2014 19:53:51]  <Alicia> (Well, naturally, she's not so out of it to not glare at him, I'm sure.)
[13-Sep-2014 19:54:50]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[13-Sep-2014 19:55:54]  <Rig> Kazuki grimaces in response to the glare. “We need to go, Rin. Can you walk?"
[13-Sep-2014 19:57:02]  <IllFlower> ("I can walk by myself! Geez..." /tsundere)
[13-Sep-2014 19:58:36]  <BGTB2005> "Yeah."
[13-Sep-2014 19:58:52]  <IllFlower> (Way to wreck my imagination!)
[13-Sep-2014 19:59:15]  <Rig> Shall we exit pursued by police then?
[13-Sep-2014 19:59:53]  <IllFlower> Maybe without that last part.
[13-Sep-2014 20:00:10]  <Alicia> We're sneakier than that, when we can sneak.
[13-Sep-2014 20:00:11]  <IllFlower> So, what happens now?
[13-Sep-2014 20:00:42]  <ponicalica> I think Kazuki said something about returning to Shii?
[13-Sep-2014 20:01:03]  <Rig> I believe we should report to the Order that there was an incident and in the chaos the suspects escaped.
[13-Sep-2014 20:01:26]  <Alicia> That sounds good, yeah.
[13-Sep-2014 20:02:38]  <IllFlower> Just as expected from Kazuki the Spin Doctor.
[13-Sep-2014 20:02:41]  <IllFlower> So it shall be, then.
[13-Sep-2014 20:03:23]  <Rig> ^_^
[13-Sep-2014 20:03:34]  <IllFlower> The Conservators make their way back to home base, not really paying heed to the rain either way.
[13-Sep-2014 20:04:35]  <IllFlower> Shii and Pyunpyun are there waiting for them. It's as if they haven't moved an inch since the Conservators left - which may actually be the case.
[13-Sep-2014 20:07:04]  <IllFlower> "Hardly a triumphant return," Pyunpyun remarks on seeing their rain-soaked bodies.
[13-Sep-2014 20:07:44]  <Rig> Gotta switch out laundry. I’ll brb. Feel free to assume Kazuki is sneering at everyone.
[13-Sep-2014 20:08:45]  <Alicia> (Then I'll get soup, maybeh)
[13-Sep-2014 20:08:48]  <BGTB2005> (and Rin will look like she's trying to set Kazuki on fire with her mind)

[13-Sep-2014 20:14:51]  <Rig> “I don’t think our team should be the one pursuing them. In fact, I think our team needs to take a step back from this situation entirely, to be honest.” Kazuki can feel the glares of the girls on him, but he ignores them.

[13-Sep-2014 20:20:29]  <Alicia> Well, everyone else escaped once objects began violently hitting the fan. I think.
[13-Sep-2014 20:21:17]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun balks. "Do you mean my initiates were attacking civilians?"
[13-Sep-2014 20:21:55]  <IllFlower> Shii has retreated, seemingly no longer willing to get in the way of Pyunpyun's questioning.
[13-Sep-2014 20:22:15]  <BGTB2005> "As far as I could tell, they were not."
[13-Sep-2014 20:22:21]  <ponicalica> "I think they all left before anything happened, actually."

[13-Sep-2014 20:23:08]  <IllFlower> "Then what do you mean, Sakura?"
[13-Sep-2014 20:23:27]  <Alicia> "A fight broke out between us, save for Kazuki, and your initiates."
[13-Sep-2014 20:24:18]  <IllFlower> "I gathered that much."
[13-Sep-2014 20:27:19]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun looks to continue, but Shii interrupts first. "What he means is that you haven't told us how exactly civilians were involved. Fights happen all the time. They're part of the job."
[13-Sep-2014 20:27:19]  <Alicia> "Well, we - er, Ayako..." Hikari goes over how to say it. It all happened so quickly. "Ayako ended up trying to take them on, and Miu got thrown out of a window. Ritsuko and Youichi tried to escape, and... I don't know what happened after that."
[13-Sep-2014 20:27:41]  <Alicia> (Or never mind? :v I'm confused.)
[13-Sep-2014 20:28:04]  <Alicia> (Because civilians didn't ended up getting involved, I thought, so much as it was Ayako attacking them.)
[13-Sep-2014 20:28:11]  <ponicalica> (Kazuki mentioned civilians)
[13-Sep-2014 20:28:18]  <ponicalica> (potential, not actual, really)

[13-Sep-2014 20:28:29]  <Alicia> (Oh, my bad.)
[13-Sep-2014 20:28:58]  <Alicia> (Then okay should I rework that or does that work? It still fits under "risk to civilians" so...)
[13-Sep-2014 20:29:45]  <Rig> I think it works if you just mention that all of this happened inside a restaraunt with other people and Ayako’s attack kind of overdid it.
[13-Sep-2014 20:29:57]  <Alicia> Mmm.
[13-Sep-2014 20:30:01]  <IllFlower> Yeah, nobody's mentioned that yet, ahem.
[13-Sep-2014 20:30:27]  <IllFlower> I'm surprised Kazuki's not chipping in here, but maybe he's showing verbal restraint for once.
[13-Sep-2014 20:30:38]  <Rig> “The initiates had taken shelter inside a restaraunt full of civilians,” Kazuki mentions.
[13-Sep-2014 20:30:39]  <Alicia> "This all took place inside a restaurant, while Ayako and I were trying to convince Youichi and his friends to return with us."
[13-Sep-2014 20:30:48]  <Alicia> (>:I)
[13-Sep-2014 20:30:53]  <Rig> Let’s go with Alicia’s instead of Kazuki's.
[13-Sep-2014 20:31:33]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun shakes his head. "Human shields," he says in a low voice.
[13-Sep-2014 20:32:04]  <Alicia> "Kazuki had already left..." Hikari mentions as an afterthought, remembering what Kazuki had told her earlier.
[13-Sep-2014 20:33:24]  <IllFlower> "Let's not get into those details now," Shii says. "The most important thing is to figure out what to do now that the cult is at large."
[13-Sep-2014 20:36:41]  <Alicia> (Man, what to do. Kazuki could say he dealt with them, but >Kazuki.)
[13-Sep-2014 20:37:16]  <ponicalica> (Well, his suggestion is to pawn it off on another group of initiates.)
[13-Sep-2014 20:38:21]  <IllFlower> (You know, responsibility.)
[13-Sep-2014 20:38:37]  <Alicia> (Yeah, he's up for it. Hikari is Hikari, though, Ayako's busy thinking over her blow up, and I'unno about Rin.)
[13-Sep-2014 20:39:06]  <ponicalica> (Rin is utterly confused after actually succeeding in helping someone, even if they are a cultist)
[13-Sep-2014 20:39:36]  <BGTB2005> yeah, more or less
[13-Sep-2014 20:40:57]  <Rig> “As I said, I think another team should pursue them. They do not trust us and are…” Kazuki pauses looking for the right word, “capable of manipulating some of us.”
[13-Sep-2014 20:41:44]  <ponicalica> Kazuki then proceeds to stare utter fucking daggers at Rin, probably
[13-Sep-2014 20:42:20]  <Alicia> You can feel the hatred.
[13-Sep-2014 20:42:37]  <IllFlower> "This gets less reassuring by the minute," Pyunpyun says, obliquely glacing at Shii.
[13-Sep-2014 20:43:23]  <IllFlower> Shii looks back at Kazuki. "You can't be this vague. What exactly happened?
[13-Sep-2014 20:44:10]  <Rig> “Rin sympathizes with the initiates,” he says flatly.
[13-Sep-2014 20:44:14]  <IllFlower> "We can't just send another group after the cult without more details. Not when they apparently managed to turn back *four* of you. You're hardly all newbies."
[13-Sep-2014 20:44:59]  <IllFlower> ...
[13-Sep-2014 20:45:04]  <IllFlower> "Rin, is this true?" Shii asks.
[13-Sep-2014 20:50:40]  <BGTB2005> "Yes."
[13-Sep-2014 20:52:03]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun looks ready to explode from incredulity.
[13-Sep-2014 20:52:40]  <ponicalica> (also, Snezana has a gun and is just outside the building. He'll explode much more literally from that.)
[13-Sep-2014 20:53:06]  <ponicalica> (shut up I know guns don't actually make you blow up)
[13-Sep-2014 20:53:21]  <Alicia> (I'd really like to see Kazuki's Hate-o-meter throughout this session.)
[13-Sep-2014 20:53:49]  <ponicalica> (Kazuki and Rin's hate-o-meters are pretty much on maximum now I think
[13-Sep-2014 20:53:56]  <BGTB2005> "I don't feel it was right to deny Narumi a memorial for her sister."
[13-Sep-2014 20:54:06]  <IllFlower> Shii is rather more composed, though. "That doesn't explain how we get to civilians in danger and needing someone else to step in," she says.
[13-Sep-2014 20:54:24]  <BGTB2005> (Also guns can totally make you explode Fallout told me so)
[13-Sep-2014 20:54:47]  <IllFlower> "Differences of opinion are normal. This is not."
[13-Sep-2014 20:55:54]  <IllFlower> Shii paces. "I'll have this case transferred, but not for the reasons you've mentioned. I'll keep that my own secret, though I'm sure that just like with your secrets, they're actually fairly obvious."
[13-Sep-2014 20:56:14]  <IllFlower> s/keep that/keep my reasons/
[13-Sep-2014 20:56:40]  <Rig> Kazuki galnces at Hikari, wondering what exactly happened in the restaraunt.
[13-Sep-2014 20:57:01]  <IllFlower> She gives Kazuki a pointed look. Kazuki looks at Hikari, in turn.
[13-Sep-2014 20:57:43]  <Alicia> (So, what, explain that Ayako just flared up?)
[13-Sep-2014 20:58:03]  <IllFlower> "You're free to go," Shii finally says to Pyunpyun. "I'll let you know when we've settled on a new team for this case."
[13-Sep-2014 20:58:24]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun nods, vanishing with a subdued *crack*.
[13-Sep-2014 20:58:56]  <IllFlower> With that, Shii returns her attention to the Conservators.
[13-Sep-2014 21:00:10]  <IllFlower> "What happened? I feel like I'm hearing a different story every time someone opens their mouth.
[13-Sep-2014 21:00:21]  <IllFlower> "You are working *together*, yes?"
[13-Sep-2014 21:03:19]  <Rig> “If you mean we are generally in the same area, yes.”
[13-Sep-2014 21:03:38]  <ponicalica> itt Kazuki being a snarky asshole
[13-Sep-2014 21:04:38]  <Alicia> (Lol, Kazuki working with others.)
[13-Sep-2014 21:06:08]  <IllFlower> Shii shakes her head.
[13-Sep-2014 21:07:19]  <IllFlower> "I want each of you to tell me what happened in the time since you left.
[13-Sep-2014 21:07:52]  <IllFlower> "Why don't we start with you, Hikari?"
[13-Sep-2014 21:10:07]  <IllFlower> (I'm going to go down the line, so better get your stories ready!)

[13-Sep-2014 21:14:46]  <IllFlower> Recap: Flowers, restaurant, despair.
[13-Sep-2014 21:15:04]  <Alicia> Hikari nods. "We decided to go search the initiates out, and found them in a restaurant. There, we all thought it'd be best for Ayako and Rin to talk to them, since they don't hate Rin. Kazuki and I were waiting outside, before we saw some commotion going on inside. When we went in, Ayako was hurt and the others were angry. Kazuki, Ayako, and I, all tried to convince them, though Kazuki left soon after that." She emphasizes her last
[13-Sep-2014 21:15:05]  <IllFlower> You don't have to be hideously thorough. Flustered is good.

[13-Sep-2014 21:16:43]  <Alicia> (Summed it all up with the bit after that.)
[13-Sep-2014 21:17:05]  <IllFlower> "Lost control?" Shii asks Hikari, her eyes occasionally darting towards Ayako.
[13-Sep-2014 21:18:05]  <ponicalica> duh duh duh
[13-Sep-2014 21:18:27]  <Alicia> Hikari goes silent briefly, tying the events back into order. "She started using magic, which is how Miu ended up getting hurt. I'm not sure how or when after that, because it's such a blur..."
[13-Sep-2014 21:18:43]  <Alicia> "And then it was over. Ayako passed out."
[13-Sep-2014 21:19:12]  <IllFlower> "Ayako?"
[13-Sep-2014 21:19:20]  <Alicia> "I don't know what happened to the other two initiates after that." Hikari states flatly, grimacing.
[13-Sep-2014 21:20:32]  <ponicalica> "I...don't really know what happened.  I remember confronting them at the diner, and then things start getting fuzzy.  I think a punch was thrown, but after they grabbed me I don't actually remember anything..."
[13-Sep-2014 21:22:11]  <IllFlower> "What happened to justify the use of magic in a public place?"
[13-Sep-2014 21:23:24]  <ponicalica> "Th-they must have attacked me.  I don't even remember losing control, but it happened again..."
[13-Sep-2014 21:24:44]  <Rig> Kazuki watches Ayako carefully.
[13-Sep-2014 21:24:46]  <IllFlower> "What is 'it', exactly?" Shii asks. "Hikari? Rin?"

[13-Sep-2014 21:29:44]  <Alicia> "Darkness surrounded Ayako and the initiates, and a few lights ended up darting out of the cloud afterwards. I tried catching Youichi so that Ayako wouldn't attack him, and..."
[13-Sep-2014 21:29:59]  <BGTB2005> "I didn't see what happened, but I saw a bolt of light go past me and I heard glass shattering, so I guess Ayako used magic to send Miu through a window."
[13-Sep-2014 21:31:31]  <IllFlower> "'Again,' though?"
[13-Sep-2014 21:31:31]  <Alicia> She wracks her brain. "I don't know after that. I couldn't reach Ayako. I thought if Youichi stopped attacking, Ayako would as well."
[13-Sep-2014 21:31:49]  <ponicalica> "Like against Yuuya, where my magic slipped out, and I lost control..."
[13-Sep-2014 21:34:01]  <IllFlower> "What I'm gathering is that nothing happened to justify this."
[13-Sep-2014 21:34:09]  <IllFlower> The disappointment in Shii's voice is plain as day.
[13-Sep-2014 21:35:30]  <ponicalica> Ayako done fucked up.
[13-Sep-2014 21:36:07]  <Rig> Kazuki keeps his comments to himself for once. He honestly couldn’t add anything to make this better.
[13-Sep-2014 21:36:18]  <IllFlower> Haha, about that...
[13-Sep-2014 21:36:47]  <Alicia> (I'm not sure if I want Hikari to talk here? She's said all she knows, and it's obvious she's not proud. Adding a quiet no or something wouldn't work.)
[13-Sep-2014 21:36:51]  <Alicia> talk more*
[13-Sep-2014 21:36:58]  <IllFlower> "And Kazuki?" Shii pointedly asks. "Hikari says you left? Why, exactly?"

[13-Sep-2014 21:37:27]  <ponicalica> Also, you know, I think this may be the first time that Shii has actually been upset.
[13-Sep-2014 21:38:33]  <Rig> “I left to wait for the initiates to leave the restaraunt. We obviously couldn’t convince them to leave, and making a scene wouldn’t have been advantageous. My plan was to apprehend them in a location less likely to result in civilians being exposed to magic. I believed that it was clear to my teammates. I overestimated their ability to pick up on hints.”
[13-Sep-2014 21:38:42]  <Rig> “Or I underestimated how bloodthirsty they might be.”
[13-Sep-2014 21:38:51]  <Rig> He gives a pointed glance at Ayako.
[13-Sep-2014 21:39:45]  <IllFlower> Lots of pointedness today, huh.
[13-Sep-2014 21:39:57]  <Rig> We’re all on pins and needles, you might say.
[13-Sep-2014 21:40:09]  <ponicalica> I assume Kazuki's eyes are pretty much 90% daggers at this point
[13-Sep-2014 21:40:38]  <Alicia> Hikari tenses up in response, though she stifles her response quickly. Now isn't the time.
[13-Sep-2014 21:41:01]  <IllFlower> "This is the second time something like this has happened, Kazuki.
[13-Sep-2014 21:41:23]  <IllFlower> "Understand that the blame for failures of communication lies partly on the communicator."
[13-Sep-2014 21:41:56]  <Rig> Kazuki stiffles a comment about crypticism being a high art inside the order.

[13-Sep-2014 21:45:03]  <IllFlower> At least disconsolately nod or something, yeesh!
[13-Sep-2014 21:46:26]  <Rig> “Perhaps I could have been clearer about my intention to set a trap, directly in front of the parties we intended to trap."
[13-Sep-2014 21:47:29]  <IllFlower> "You know that wasn't the only option."
[13-Sep-2014 21:48:08]  <Rig> Kazuki nods.
[13-Sep-2014 21:48:08]  <Alicia> Hikari glares in his direction, before turning away.
[13-Sep-2014 21:49:25]  <Alicia> (I want Hikari to begin making some snappy comments back, but...)
[13-Sep-2014 21:49:59]  <IllFlower> "That goes equally for all of you. There was no reason for this to go as poorly as it did.
[13-Sep-2014 21:50:13]  <Nitya> 14i'm sure this situation can be resolved with sarcasm! (get it?)
[13-Sep-2014 21:51:45]  <IllFlower> "I know each of you prefers a different approach to things. The idea behind putting you together on a team was to come up with fresh ideas, not devolve into internal squabbles."
[13-Sep-2014 21:54:01]  <IllFlower> Shii pauses for a moment, then continues. "Do we believe this is possible?"
[13-Sep-2014 21:54:10]  <IllFlower> Her eyes land on each of her charges in turn.
[13-Sep-2014 21:54:35]  <ponicalica> Ayako nods.  "I'm sorry that I failed to understand Kazuki's plans, ran out when he was about to explain them."
[13-Sep-2014 21:55:52]  <Rig> Kazuki meets Shii’s gaze. Whether this is a yes or no is left up to Shii’s discretion.

[13-Sep-2014 21:58:20]  <IllFlower> Because that's anticlimactically vague!
[13-Sep-2014 21:58:22]  <Alicia> "I'm sure of it." Hikari answers. "Regardless of any issues." She adds on frankly, head tilting towards Kazuki a bit, just to be clear.
[13-Sep-2014 21:58:25]  <IllFlower> Who do you think you are, me?!

[13-Sep-2014 22:17:09]  <IllFlower> All righty, then it's off to page 121 with all of you.
[13-Sep-2014 22:17:15]  <Rig> That none of us are any good at being consistent.

[13-Sep-2014 22:18:01]  <IllFlower> Or questions, though the answers may be elusive.
[13-Sep-2014 22:18:20]  <Rig> It was more interesting when we weren’t fighting people.
[13-Sep-2014 22:18:27]  <Alicia> Yes.
[13-Sep-2014 22:18:29]  <Rig> We should have jumped to conflicts sooner in a lot of places.
[13-Sep-2014 22:19:01]  <Alicia> I did actually try to focus on talking rather than fightan. Not sure how that panned out though.
[13-Sep-2014 22:19:41]  <IllFlower> That is kinda the direction I've been moving in the last three arcs, haha.
[13-Sep-2014 22:19:58]  <Rig> Understandable.

[13-Sep-2014 22:20:13]  <Rig> Still just need to jump to conflicts sooner because we can’t really come to conclusions without them.
[13-Sep-2014 22:20:18]  <Nitya> 14as far as i can tell this game is rapidly becoming Mahou OfficeSpace, which, now that i say it, sounds perfectly IllFlower
[13-Sep-2014 22:20:43]  <IllFlower> Nonsense. They haven't beaten up the magical scribe in a field yet.
[13-Sep-2014 22:20:54]  <Rig> We’ll try though.
[13-Sep-2014 22:20:56]  <Alicia> Nitya: What.
[13-Sep-2014 22:21:01]  <ponicalica> Yeah, a lot of the times we've had pre-conflict conversations that seem more suited to conflict
[13-Sep-2014 22:21:07]  <Nitya> 14[[office space]]
[13-Sep-2014 22:21:09]  <Omnipresence> 14Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space — Office Space is a 1999 American comedy film written and directed by Mike Judge. Satirizing work life in a typical mid-to-late-1990s software company, it focuses on a handful of individuals fed…
[13-Sep-2014 22:21:10]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: are you saying Ayako's gonna die ;_;
[13-Sep-2014 22:21:33]  <Alicia> Ooh that.
[13-Sep-2014 22:21:37]  <IllFlower> "'PC LOAD PARCHMENT'? What the fuck does that mean?"
[13-Sep-2014 22:22:02]  * ponicalica hasn't watched Office Space :V
[13-Sep-2014 22:22:07]  <IllFlower> Okay, I'll keep the talky conflict thing in mind.
[13-Sep-2014 22:22:22]  <Nitya> me neither, it's just that you just got into an argument with your manager based on you're all assholes
[13-Sep-2014 22:22:29]  <BGTB2005> sounds like something to do for a group watch?
[13-Sep-2014 22:22:53]  <Alicia> Hikari's not an asshole, Nitya.
[13-Sep-2014 22:22:59]  <Alicia> Just full of herself.
[13-Sep-2014 22:23:12]  <BGTB2005> at least, we haven't seen her be one
[13-Sep-2014 22:23:14]  <Alicia> Now Kazuki...
[13-Sep-2014 22:23:15]  <BGTB2005> yet
[13-Sep-2014 22:23:16]  <Rig> Just like how Kazuki isn’t being an asshole. Just being honest to his goals.
[13-Sep-2014 22:23:24]  <IllFlower> Nah, Office Space was about liberation from an impersonal bureaucratic hellhole through - well, okay, maybe you have a point.
[13-Sep-2014 22:23:32]  <ponicalica> Ayako's not an asshole, she's just...nah, she's an asshole
[13-Sep-2014 22:23:55]  <BGTB2005> Rin is, um...
[13-Sep-2014 22:23:59]  <ponicalica> also an asshole
[13-Sep-2014 22:24:00]  <BGTB2005> She doesn't think she's one?
[13-Sep-2014 22:24:01]  <Rig> Anyway, IllFlower, I’d like to up lying as a last resort from d6 to d8.
[13-Sep-2014 22:24:21]  <IllFlower> But you didn't really lie as a last resort this arc, haha.
[13-Sep-2014 22:24:38]  <Rig> But Kazuki did lie frequently enough.
[13-Sep-2014 22:24:39]  <IllFlower> I mean, if that's a lesson, it's all well and good, but the trait didn't really even get used.
[13-Sep-2014 22:24:40]  <Alicia> BGTB2005: Still dealing with emotional issues.
[13-Sep-2014 22:24:44]  <ponicalica> I think it's that he realized what's bad about lying, but I'm not sure that's the lesson, lol
[13-Sep-2014 22:25:20]  <Rig> Honestly, Kazuki wasn’t in enough conflicts this time to really get any traits used.
[13-Sep-2014 22:25:48]  <IllFlower> Because he kept leaving before they happened! >_>
[13-Sep-2014 22:25:59]  <Rig> Because they should have happened earlier.
[13-Sep-2014 22:26:11]  <Rig> Like that entire thing in the diner should have been a conflict.
[13-Sep-2014 22:26:25]  <Rig> But we rolled for it after I got tired of the scene and wanted to move on.
[13-Sep-2014 22:26:27]  <IllFlower> Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true too.
[13-Sep-2014 22:26:39]  <ponicalica> I think the only reason it wasn't a conflict was so that Ayako could punch without actually escalating
[13-Sep-2014 22:26:58]  <Alicia> Before actually escalating. Magically.
[13-Sep-2014 22:27:15]  <IllFlower> I probably would have made it one if someone had prompted for it.
[13-Sep-2014 22:27:22]  <IllFlower> Note to self: Don't wait for people to prompt for conflict.
[13-Sep-2014 22:27:36]  <Rig> I’ll remember to constantly prompt for conflict whenever I feel like we’re getting bogged down.
[13-Sep-2014 22:27:39]  <ponicalica> I think there was at least one instance where I suggested a conflict and you had us argue more
[13-Sep-2014 22:27:54]  <ponicalica> maybe that was the previous branch?
[13-Sep-2014 22:28:07]  <IllFlower> <Rig> Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail? Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail? Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?

[13-Sep-2014 22:28:27]  <Alicia> lol.
[13-Sep-2014 22:28:28]  <Rig> I really don’t know where to put experience though. Maybe add another die to Youichi’s relationship.
[13-Sep-2014 22:28:42]  <IllFlower> Maybe a Wl bump.
[13-Sep-2014 22:28:46]  <Nitya> 1d8 is an asshole
[13-Sep-2014 22:28:50]  <Nitya> just saying!!
[13-Sep-2014 22:28:50]  <ponicalica> lol
[13-Sep-2014 22:29:14]  <Alicia> You forgot "slimy"
[13-Sep-2014 22:29:15]  <ponicalica> I don't know where to put experience either
[13-Sep-2014 22:29:21]  <IllFlower> Wl is basically supposed to be the "is an asshole" trait. I think.

[13-Sep-2014 22:29:54]  <IllFlower> "More dice in Will means a character who’s tenacious, aggressive, confident, unflinching, strong-willed, or unshakable." // basically asshole, right
[13-Sep-2014 22:30:00]  <ponicalica> yeah, pretty much
[13-Sep-2014 22:30:05]  <ponicalica> that's "asshole" in positive terms
[13-Sep-2014 22:30:05]  <Rig> Or maybe I can bump Wl twice.
[13-Sep-2014 22:30:08]  <Rig> For the hell of it.
[13-Sep-2014 22:30:25]  <IllFlower> Rig: The former works for me. The latter's a bit boring.
[13-Sep-2014 22:31:14]  <BGTB2005> Could I add one to Ac, for healing Miu?
[13-Sep-2014 22:31:35]  <IllFlower> Sounds okay to me.
[13-Sep-2014 22:31:51]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@c-76-16-39-247.hsd1.il.comcast.net> has joined #madokamadness
[13-Sep-2014 22:33:03]  <Alicia> Yeah I'm not sure about experience either.
[13-Sep-2014 22:33:39]  <IllFlower> Relationship with Ayako seems relevant here.
[13-Sep-2014 22:33:46]  <Alicia> She semi-told off Rin about the Order, made sure the initiates didn't disrespect the Order... and I'm not sure how to sum up that whole deal with the diner.
[13-Sep-2014 22:33:55]  <IllFlower> You can revise the dice on a trait or relationship downward if need be.
[13-Sep-2014 22:35:58]  <IllFlower> Relationships with the Conservators might also be a good thing to examine.
[13-Sep-2014 22:36:47]  <Alicia> I don't think that even ended up getting used. Or any of the Relationships. :v
[13-Sep-2014 22:36:56]  <ponicalica> the deal with the diner is that you're now sort of protecting Ayako from herself
[13-Sep-2014 22:37:56]  <Alicia> Mm. Of all the Conservators I figure that leaves Hikari as the one that doesn't actually hate her.
[13-Sep-2014 22:38:04]  <IllFlower> Oh, I suppose you can do the thing with adding unassigned relationship dice.
[13-Sep-2014 22:38:13]  <IllFlower> If your heart grew three sizes bigger that day.
[13-Sep-2014 22:38:44]  <ponicalica> Or you saw the hidden dark side of magical humanity

[13-Sep-2014 22:39:53]  <Alicia> I think I want to increase the relationship die with Ayako, and a stat. Heart or Will.
[13-Sep-2014 22:39:57]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@c-76-16-39-247.hsd1.il.comcast.net> has joined #madokamadness
[13-Sep-2014 22:40:02]  <Alicia> Though there's also the feelings/law bit.
[13-Sep-2014 22:40:25]  <IllFlower> You messed with those traits quite a bit already this arc, though I suppose that's not a reason you can't keep doing that.
[13-Sep-2014 22:40:37]  <IllFlower> A new trait might be on order?
[13-Sep-2014 22:40:57]  <Alicia> Hmm...
[13-Sep-2014 22:41:07]  <IllFlower> I'm not really sure I can pin down exactly what Hikari's role was, though.
[13-Sep-2014 22:41:24]  <ponicalica> failed mediator probably
[13-Sep-2014 22:41:45]  <IllFlower> Kazuki was militant, Rin was sympathetic, Ayako and Hikari kinda got caught in the middle.
[13-Sep-2014 22:44:00]  <Alicia> Hikari got a bit too caught up in making sure those that disobeyed stopped disobeying, which... well, not effectively stopping Ayako's powers would be the conclusion of that.
[13-Sep-2014 22:44:49]  <IllFlower> "My comrades' actions are my responsibility too 1d6"
[13-Sep-2014 22:45:25]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Anything on the other experience item?
[13-Sep-2014 22:46:06]  <Alicia> 1d6 Wants to keep the order? This being everything from, like, "Oh shit Ayako let loose" to "Okay disobeying the Order is WRONG, but the team comes first."
[13-Sep-2014 22:46:16]  <IllFlower> I was thinking that Rin could stand to be more assertive with her teammates, but then I remembered how she basically started wailing on Kazuki halfway through...
[13-Sep-2014 22:46:31]  <Alicia> Ahah.
[13-Sep-2014 22:46:42]  <IllFlower> Alicia: That's a little vague.
[13-Sep-2014 22:46:51]  <Alicia> Hm.. yeah, it is.
[13-Sep-2014 22:47:52]  <IllFlower> Thinking from Hikari's perspective, I could see her going "I need to make sure Ayako - or any of my teammates - never does anything like that again."
[13-Sep-2014 22:48:40]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: /me looks at "takes charge"
[13-Sep-2014 22:48:41]  <Alicia> Yeah she's, in her self-righteous way, been trying to not let things get dumb. While of course letting others know that they're wrong.
[13-Sep-2014 22:48:55]  <Alicia> Because they are.
[13-Sep-2014 22:49:01]  <BGTB2005> Rin might be a tad irritated over being left out in part of Hikari's summary of events, but I'm not sure how that would affect her relationship with Hikari
[13-Sep-2014 22:49:39]  <Alicia> Well, Hikari also got in the way of her punching out Kazuki.
[13-Sep-2014 22:49:43]  <Alicia> (Sad day that day.)
[13-Sep-2014 22:50:00]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: And maybe that relationship with Rin.
[13-Sep-2014 22:51:10]  <IllFlower> Alicia: A simple way to think about it: The righteous judge both their allies and their enemies in equal measure.
[13-Sep-2014 22:51:31]  <Rig> I’ve gotta go.
[13-Sep-2014 22:51:32]  *** Rig <~Iverum@c-50-148-120-29.hsd1.in.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Rig)
[13-Sep-2014 22:51:40]  <IllFlower> And there he goes.
[13-Sep-2014 22:51:41]  <Alicia> That's more succinct than I can do. >_>;
[13-Sep-2014 22:51:45]  <Alicia> But, yeah.
[13-Sep-2014 22:52:17]  <ponicalica> more succinct than Hikari can do :p
[13-Sep-2014 22:52:41]  <Alicia> 1d6 The judge of situations? Or maybe there's a better way of putting it, but something that gets across her knowing what is actually up.
[13-Sep-2014 22:52:46]  <Alicia> ponicalica: I tryyyyyyyyy.
[13-Sep-2014 22:52:56]  <Alicia> I'm just not good at speaking in general.
[13-Sep-2014 22:53:29]  <ponicalica> I was just referencing her intended mode of speaking already
[13-Sep-2014 22:53:38]  <IllFlower> That's the spirit in which I suggested "reponsible for my comrades' actions."
[13-Sep-2014 22:53:40]  <ponicalica> which as you mentioned is a bit overly formal
[13-Sep-2014 22:53:56]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Oh, misunderstood. >__>;
[13-Sep-2014 22:54:18]  <IllFlower> The last thing you need when you're on a righteous streak is an unrighteous ally undermining you.
[13-Sep-2014 22:54:43]  <BGTB2005> too bad she's surrounded by them
[13-Sep-2014 22:55:31]  <Alicia> IllFlower: That... yeah, I get what you're getting at, now. Oops. So perhaps that die, and up one of her stats (Ht) or her relationship with Ayako?
[13-Sep-2014 22:55:59]  <Alicia> Upping Bd doesn't make sense. Wl I could see but not as much as that. Acuity... she's no Ayako, lol.
[13-Sep-2014 22:56:20]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: "I can help people [and not just be a bundle of rage] 1d6"
[13-Sep-2014 22:56:58]  <IllFlower> Alicia: I'd go for the relationship with Ayako.
[13-Sep-2014 22:57:28]  <Alicia> IllFlower: I was leaning towards that, even if I wanna up a stat.
[13-Sep-2014 22:57:40]  <Alicia> So that works. Even if Relationships don't seem to get pulled in much.
[13-Sep-2014 22:57:53]  <IllFlower> I mean, I agree with you that the stat bumps don't make all that much sense.
[13-Sep-2014 22:57:59]  <BGTB2005> I'm not sure if it's distinct enough from '1d6 Stands up for others'
[13-Sep-2014 22:58:28]  <ponicalica> well with the trait IF mentioned, the not just a bundle of rage is important
[13-Sep-2014 22:58:44]  <ponicalica> since there's helping people by healing them, and helping people by pummelling a bully
[13-Sep-2014 22:58:58]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Well, the intended nuance is "sometimes violence is not the answer," haha.
[13-Sep-2014 22:59:27]  <Alicia> Rin is improving! While Ayako isn't! Kazuki continues to be a slimy jerk, and Hikari the sole bastion of righteousness! Exclamation marks!
[13-Sep-2014 22:59:43]  <IllFlower> Maybe notching "if it doesn't work, use more" or "sticks to her strengths" down might communicate that.
[13-Sep-2014 23:00:01]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Were you considering anything?
[13-Sep-2014 23:00:24]  <Alicia> IllFlower: So, yeah. Adding that trait, and upping her Relationship with Ayako.
[13-Sep-2014 23:00:36]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Still not sure, even with the hints you gave.
[13-Sep-2014 23:00:40]  <Alicia> 1d6 Responsible for the lack of righteousness
[13-Sep-2014 23:00:52]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Done.
[13-Sep-2014 23:00:55]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@c-76-16-39-247.hsd1.il.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.90.1 [Firefox 32.0.1/20140911151253])
[13-Sep-2014 23:01:07]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Depends on how you want to spin it.
[13-Sep-2014 23:01:26]  <IllFlower> Is Ayako doing a tailspin into madness or starting to level out a bit?
[13-Sep-2014 23:01:34]  <Alicia> "3d10 Magical education 2d10 Can handle danagerous magic" Damn gurl, still.
[13-Sep-2014 23:02:12]  <IllFlower> Her lack of confidence in her own self-control might lead her to hold back her magical abilityies.
[13-Sep-2014 23:02:31]  <IllFlower> s/y//
[13-Sep-2014 23:02:57]  <IllFlower> So one of those traits might lose a die, or shrink to d8.
[13-Sep-2014 23:03:11]  <ponicalica> Hmm, well, I think she is backsliding/deteriorating/etc a bit, it remains to be seen what comes next.  I think the "holding back" thing makes a lot of sense.
[13-Sep-2014 23:03:19]  <IllFlower> I should remove the wand now that she doesn't have it anymore, eh.
[13-Sep-2014 23:03:30]  <Alicia> Not as if she needs it. ;)
[13-Sep-2014 23:04:36]  <BGTB2005> I think she might want it back at some point in the future, though
[13-Sep-2014 23:04:45]  <BGTB2005> when she feels she ahs control over her magic again?
[13-Sep-2014 23:04:48]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Because I am Slow, I just got the other implication of "responsibility" in her new Trait. By which I mean the whole "Of course Hikari would think she is" deal.
[13-Sep-2014 23:04:55]  <Alicia> Sry for slowness.
[13-Sep-2014 23:04:57]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: Maybe.  We can cross that bridge when we come to it, lol
[13-Sep-2014 23:04:58]  <IllFlower> Well, I just crossed it out so it's obvious it's gone.
[13-Sep-2014 23:05:39]  <IllFlower> Okay, so Alicia and Rig are done. BGTB2005 still needs one more change, ponicalica two.
[13-Sep-2014 23:06:30]  <ponicalica> I think I'll take 2d10→2d8 on dangerous magic, as she feels her control over same is deteriorating, etc.
[13-Sep-2014 23:07:13]  <IllFlower> Mm, I thought that was more for when other people used it against her.
[13-Sep-2014 23:07:33]  <ponicalica> hmm, true, maybe it should be the other d10 trait
[13-Sep-2014 23:07:52]  <ponicalica> 3d10→3d8 on that one, actually, yeah
[13-Sep-2014 23:08:09]  <ponicalica> since the knowledge is still there but has become less reliable
[13-Sep-2014 23:08:32]  <IllFlower> Done.
[13-Sep-2014 23:09:18]  <ponicalica> other XP
[13-Sep-2014 23:09:19]  <ponicalica> hmm
[13-Sep-2014 23:12:23]  <IllFlower> The relationship with Rin or the witches, perhaps.
[13-Sep-2014 23:12:51]  <Alicia> 1d1 Rin, fuck that girl
[13-Sep-2014 23:13:15]  <BGTB2005> what did Rin even do to Ayako /this/ time?
[13-Sep-2014 23:13:40]  <ponicalica> They both ran out after that one conflict that Kazuki proceeded to Kazuki up
[13-Sep-2014 23:15:10]  <IllFlower> You could drop the 1d4 relationship.
[13-Sep-2014 23:15:27]  <IllFlower> "I still don't *like* her, but she's not actually the worst person in the world."
[13-Sep-2014 23:15:48]  <ponicalica> "That's Kazuki."
[13-Sep-2014 23:15:52]  <BGTB2005> (Kazuki is)
[13-Sep-2014 23:17:04]  <IllFlower> lol, let's not *actually* make this Everybody Hates Kazuki...
[13-Sep-2014 23:17:17]  <Alicia> List of people that like Rin: Hikari, sort of.
[13-Sep-2014 23:17:30]  <Alicia> List of people that tolerate Kazuki: Hikari.
[13-Sep-2014 23:17:42]  <ponicalica> List of people that don't think Ayako is going nuts: Hikari, again
[13-Sep-2014 23:17:54]  <BGTB2005> but it's hard not to when Kazuki does Kazuki-y things
[13-Sep-2014 23:18:09]  <IllFlower> Hm, yeah, I'm actually partial to erasing the 1d4 with Rin.
[13-Sep-2014 23:18:18]  <ponicalica> yeah, I think I like that idea too
[13-Sep-2014 23:18:30]  <Alicia> It makes sense.
[13-Sep-2014 23:18:44]  <Alicia> Not like their relationship improved anyway.
[13-Sep-2014 23:18:52]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: That being said, going 1d4 -> 2d4 Kazuki makes sense for Rin...
[13-Sep-2014 23:19:35]  <IllFlower> If you don't want to do the mellowing trait adjustments I proposed earlier.
[13-Sep-2014 23:19:55]  <IllFlower> Depends on whether she's more affected by saving a girl or hating Kazuki.
[13-Sep-2014 23:20:00]  <Alicia> Rin never mellows. She just finds more efficient ways to stick it to The Man.
[13-Sep-2014 23:20:08]  <Alicia> (I kid. She did A Good Thing.)
[13-Sep-2014 23:20:55]  <Alicia> Maybe both. "I sure hate Kazuki, but like I need that ass to do good."
[13-Sep-2014 23:21:20]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005 already bumped Rin's Ac.
[13-Sep-2014 23:21:35]  <Alicia> Oh, right.
[13-Sep-2014 23:21:53]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.13.229.16> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[13-Sep-2014 23:21:58]  <BGTB2005> I'm now trying to decide between adding a d4 to the relationship with Kazuki, or something along the lines of '1d6 Can help people without harming others'
[13-Sep-2014 23:23:09]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that's why I mentioned bumping down the other traits, since that's the inverse of "if it doesn't work, use more" as far as I can tell.
[13-Sep-2014 23:23:22]  <IllFlower> Adding a new trait works too, though.
[13-Sep-2014 23:23:56]  <IllFlower> In fact, I think having both of those "opposite" traits for now might be a good illustration of an inner conflict on Rin's part, if that's the direction you want to go.
[13-Sep-2014 23:25:13]  <IllFlower> Up to you.
[13-Sep-2014 23:25:27]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Scratched the 1d4 with Rin.
[13-Sep-2014 23:25:41]  <BGTB2005> I think I'll do that
[13-Sep-2014 23:25:46]  <IllFlower> New trait?
[13-Sep-2014 23:25:50]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[13-Sep-2014 23:26:00]  <IllFlower> Cool.
[13-Sep-2014 23:26:52]  <IllFlower> Okay, I think that handles everything. Thanks for playing, everyone!
[13-Sep-2014 23:27:03]  <IllFlower> We'll be back sometime for the next branch.
