[10-Aug-2014 20:07:26]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: One-Act Magic Theatre | https://room208.org/tmp/thatwentwell.mp4
[10-Aug-2014 20:08:00]  <IllFlower> When we left off, Kazuki had just brokered a compromise that wasn't really a compromise and Ayako had gone off somewhere in annoyance.
[10-Aug-2014 20:08:26]  <IllFlower> So what's the plan?
[10-Aug-2014 20:08:27]  *** Xeniera <~Solstace@71-34-82-224.ptld.qwest.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[10-Aug-2014 20:09:52]  <Alicia> Help them setup perhaps? If we're going to bother we might as well go in all the way.
[10-Aug-2014 20:09:56]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[10-Aug-2014 20:10:09]  <Rig> Nah, we still need to talk to Narumi and tell her that she can’t have a ceremony.
[10-Aug-2014 20:10:39]  <Alicia> Oh duh, right. Yeah she's the first order of business, and I'm sure it'll go swimmingly.
[10-Aug-2014 20:11:55]  <BGTB2005> didn't we agree on a private ceremony?
[10-Aug-2014 20:12:00]  <Rig> No.
[10-Aug-2014 20:12:07]  <Rig> We told the initiates we would do that.
[10-Aug-2014 20:12:07]  <IllFlower> Oh, I never did answer that question of where you could find her last time, huh.
[10-Aug-2014 20:12:13]  <Rig> We never agreed on anything.
[10-Aug-2014 20:12:41]  <IllFlower> I thought lying was supposed to be a last resort for Kazuki. ;)
[10-Aug-2014 20:13:01]  <Rig> It was a last resort.
[10-Aug-2014 20:13:08]  <Rig> Greater good and all that.
[10-Aug-2014 20:13:29]  <IllFlower> We'll say that she left you a way to contact her. Simple enough.
[10-Aug-2014 20:13:45]  <IllFlower> You can pick the place.
[10-Aug-2014 20:14:05]  <Rig> Let’s go with Shii’s office.
[10-Aug-2014 20:14:13]  <Rig> Probably without Shii there.
[10-Aug-2014 20:14:17]  <IllFlower> The pews again?
[10-Aug-2014 20:14:24]  <Rig> She’s off doing familiar things.
[10-Aug-2014 20:14:28]  <IllFlower> lol.
[10-Aug-2014 20:14:33]  <Rig> Sure, why introduce new settings?
[10-Aug-2014 20:14:38]  <Rig> 30 named settings!
[10-Aug-2014 20:15:04]  <ponicalica> save money on sets
[10-Aug-2014 20:15:34]  <IllFlower> The office is empty when the Conservators arrive. Shii must have been called out on other business.
[10-Aug-2014 20:16:35]  <IllFlower> Narumi shows up about fifteen minutes after she gets the call, in costume this time. She's either been on magical assignment, or picked up on the hint from last time.
[10-Aug-2014 20:17:03]  <IllFlower> "Is there news?" she asks.
[10-Aug-2014 20:17:21]  <Rig> So, who is here?
[10-Aug-2014 20:17:28]  <Rig> Hikari and Kazuki?
[10-Aug-2014 20:17:37]  <IllFlower> Ayako's gone.
[10-Aug-2014 20:17:42]  <IllFlower> Is Rin off stewing in a corner?
[10-Aug-2014 20:18:03]  <BGTB2005> or something
[10-Aug-2014 20:18:35]  <IllFlower> Maybe she and Ayako are stewing together, who knows.
[10-Aug-2014 20:18:50]  <IllFlower> Anyway, yes, it looks like it's just Kazuki and Hikari in the office.
[10-Aug-2014 20:19:21]  <Rig> Kazuki leans against Shii’s desk and puts on his best sympathetic face. “I’m sorry, Narumi. It’s not good news.”
[10-Aug-2014 20:20:38]  <IllFlower> "I thought as much," Narumi says with a resigned tone.
[10-Aug-2014 20:20:52]  <BGTB2005> Rin's probably off scouting for locations for a ceremony she thinks is going to happen
[10-Aug-2014 20:20:54]  <Rig> “Pyunpyun is rather set on not allowing a ceremony. And in all honesty, he is in accordance with the Order’s wishes on this.”
[10-Aug-2014 20:21:14]  <ponicalica> there's no way this whole lying thing isn't going to blow up in our faces, is there
[10-Aug-2014 20:21:49]  <Rig> Kazuki sighs. “You know that you can’t do anything magical for your sister’s memorial, but you’re allowed to participate in any other ways of remembering her, right?”
[10-Aug-2014 20:22:17]  <Alicia> (ponicalica: Smooth, Kazuki.)
[10-Aug-2014 20:23:38]  <IllFlower> "I do." Narumi looks straight at Kazuki for a moment or two, wordlessly stating the caveats.
[10-Aug-2014 20:24:41]  <Rig> Kazuki meets her gaze. “If you go against the Order on this you understand what will happen, don’t you?”
[10-Aug-2014 20:25:54]  <Rig> Perhaps another conflict is in order, Kazuki v Narumi: The Bout of the Century
[10-Aug-2014 20:26:11]  <IllFlower> Narumi leaves room for a long silence.
[10-Aug-2014 20:27:02]  <IllFlower> "That won't be necessary," she finally says. "Sorry to have taken your time."
[10-Aug-2014 20:27:12]  <Alicia> (Good job.)
[10-Aug-2014 20:27:33]  <Rig> Kazuki nods. “Sorry we couldn’t be more help.”
[10-Aug-2014 20:29:51]  *** Zia <~Christine@97-113-123-121.tukw.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Aug-2014 20:29:56]  <IllFlower> "No. I shouldn't have expected anything else," Narumi says. Her eyes are glassy, as if her mind has already left without her.
[10-Aug-2014 20:30:34]  <IllFlower> "Good-bye, then."
[10-Aug-2014 20:31:44]  <Rig> Kazuki doesn’t say anything as the girl leaves. He waits until he’s sure she’s out of earshot and then turns to Hikari. “We should probably follow her, right?”
[10-Aug-2014 20:32:50]  <Alicia> "Yes, we should. She already seems unstable, and our attempts to help certainly haven't fostered any progress."
[10-Aug-2014 20:34:36]  <Rig> “I swear we have more cultists in the Order than actual initiates,” Kazuki mutters under his breath. “Yeah, let’s go.”
[10-Aug-2014 20:35:04]  <ponicalica> kazuki decides the entire Order is corrupt, burns it all to the ground
[10-Aug-2014 20:35:17]  <IllFlower> Their minds made up, the two Conservators trail out of Shii's office and down into the passageways along the side of the former church's main hall.
[10-Aug-2014 20:35:23]  <Alicia> Honestly, I'm mildly surprised Kazuki's speaking to her normally, instead of just being all "So, we're doing this, aight?" :p
[10-Aug-2014 20:35:26]  <Rig> Didn’t I tell you that was exactly what I was planning?
[10-Aug-2014 20:35:52]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.13.247.53> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[10-Aug-2014 20:36:22]  <Rig> Kazuki is much friendlier in smaller groups.
[10-Aug-2014 20:36:43]  <IllFlower> Narumi is standing in the portico, having switched back into her civilian clothes - her school uniform, in this case. It seems she came here straight from some after-school activity.
[10-Aug-2014 20:36:51]  <IllFlower> She's talking to someone on her cell phone.
[10-Aug-2014 20:37:31]  <IllFlower> "Yeah, they gave me the same answer after all."
[10-Aug-2014 20:37:34]  <IllFlower> ...
[10-Aug-2014 20:37:48]  <IllFlower> "Wait, what do you mean?"
[10-Aug-2014 20:37:59]  <IllFlower> ...
[10-Aug-2014 20:38:28]  <IllFlower> "That's not what they told me... Mm-hmm, it was an absolute 'no.'"
[10-Aug-2014 20:38:35]  <IllFlower> ...
[10-Aug-2014 20:39:30]  <IllFlower> "Well, that doesn't make any sense! They must have --"
[10-Aug-2014 20:39:33]  <IllFlower> ...
[10-Aug-2014 20:40:08]  <IllFlower> "Maybe it was someone else? Who did you talk to?"
[10-Aug-2014 20:40:12]  <IllFlower> ...
[10-Aug-2014 20:40:51]  <Rig> Like we ever gave our names. Psh.
[10-Aug-2014 20:41:01]  <Rig> We never introduce ourselves. Policy violation, ya know.
[10-Aug-2014 20:41:17]  <BGTB2005> They can describe us, though
[10-Aug-2014 20:41:34]  <IllFlower> "Tall, older boy? I think I talked to the same one..."
[10-Aug-2014 20:41:36]  <IllFlower> Narumi shakes her head, though of course the person she's talking to can't see that.
[10-Aug-2014 20:41:36]  <Rig> “There was a pompous one, an angry one, a nerdy one, and a pretensious one."
[10-Aug-2014 20:41:38]  <Alicia> "Some talkative brunette girl and an angry looking older man."
[10-Aug-2014 20:42:00]  <Alicia> Rig: Hikari, Rin, Ayako, Kazuki?
[10-Aug-2014 20:42:15]  <IllFlower> "Then why did we get two different answers?"
[10-Aug-2014 20:42:16]  <Rig> Flipped the first and last.
[10-Aug-2014 20:42:18]  <IllFlower> ...
[10-Aug-2014 20:42:41]  <Alicia> Kazuki, Rin... yeah that's accurate.
[10-Aug-2014 20:43:00]  <IllFlower> "Are they even allowed to do that? I mean, I know they're busy, but..."
[10-Aug-2014 20:43:02]  <IllFlower> ...
[10-Aug-2014 20:43:40]  <IllFlower> Narumi sighs. "I guess that explains it."
[10-Aug-2014 20:43:40]  <IllFlower> ...
[10-Aug-2014 20:44:28]  <IllFlower> "Yeah, I'll think of something. Thanks, Ritsuko. We'll talk more when I get home, okay?"
[10-Aug-2014 20:44:32]  <IllFlower> ...
[10-Aug-2014 20:44:37]  <IllFlower> "Sure. See you later."
[10-Aug-2014 20:44:43]  <ponicalica> welp
[10-Aug-2014 20:45:13]  <IllFlower> Narumi hangs up and steps out into the street in front of the building.
[10-Aug-2014 20:45:22]  <Alicia> We made a sad girl even unhappier. Good job.
[10-Aug-2014 20:45:40]  <Rig> Life is hard.
[10-Aug-2014 20:45:51]  <BGTB2005> Rin is not going to be amused when she finds out
[10-Aug-2014 20:45:53]  <Rig> She gets hit by a car, arc over.
[10-Aug-2014 20:46:12]  <Alicia> Welp.
[10-Aug-2014 20:46:30]  <ponicalica> basically the entire arc is going to be Kazuki pissing everyone off
[10-Aug-2014 20:46:37]  <Rig> The best kind of arc.
[10-Aug-2014 20:47:44]  <Rig> Hey, IllFlower, can we make things more complicated?
[10-Aug-2014 20:47:57]  <IllFlower> Aren't they already complicated?
[10-Aug-2014 20:47:58]  <Rig> I have a ridiculous and hilarious idea.
[10-Aug-2014 20:48:17]  <IllFlower> Let's hear it.
[10-Aug-2014 20:48:28]  <Alicia> My oh my.
[10-Aug-2014 20:48:35]  * BGTB2005 prepares popcorn
[10-Aug-2014 20:48:48]  <BGTB2005> brb
[10-Aug-2014 20:49:04]  <Rig> Narumi should get a call from Rin telling her that they’ve found a place to have the ceremony. Kazuki and Hikari follow her to the meeting place and see that Rin is conspiring with Narumi to hold an unauthorized memorial ceremony.
[10-Aug-2014 20:49:11]  <Rig> Chaos ensues.
[10-Aug-2014 20:49:34]  <Alicia> That is in Rin's character.
[10-Aug-2014 20:50:17]  <BGTB2005> yeah, that's actually what I was thinking
[10-Aug-2014 20:50:26]  <Alicia> And I do like me some Conservator infighting.
[10-Aug-2014 20:50:47]  <IllFlower> Well, it's up to Rin to make that phone call, isn't it?
[10-Aug-2014 20:50:55]  <Alicia> Er. Not fighting, mind.
[10-Aug-2014 20:51:36]  <ponicalica> When should Ayako show up, btw?
[10-Aug-2014 20:52:24]  <Alicia> Maybe she's tailing Hikari and Kazuki, because she doubts Kazuki could be up to anything good.
[10-Aug-2014 20:52:30]  <Alicia> And she just shows up there.
[10-Aug-2014 20:52:41]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Whenever. I think we can safely call that enough scene time has passed.
[10-Aug-2014 20:53:30]  <Alicia> Also, we sure do tail people a lot...
[10-Aug-2014 20:53:42]  <ponicalica> Alright.  So we basically just have to find a good way to fit her in?
[10-Aug-2014 20:53:52]  <IllFlower> Either way, if anyone tails Narumi, she does actually just go straight home. So unless you guys want to try barging into her house, I think that line of inquiry has petered out.
[10-Aug-2014 20:54:32]  <Rig> So, what do we know about Hatsue’s cult?
[10-Aug-2014 20:54:44]  <Rig> Like anything solid or just “she was a cult leader"
[10-Aug-2014 20:55:35]  <BGTB2005> trying to type something up about Rin calling Narumi...
[10-Aug-2014 20:56:29]  <ponicalica> I think all that's known by anyone is that Hatsue was doing some sort of experiment and it backfired?
[10-Aug-2014 20:56:34]  <IllFlower> Rig: They got a little too curious and started using magic they were too inexperienced to handle. By the time witches got involved, they were in too deep to know how to back out. Nothing too complicated.
[10-Aug-2014 20:57:01]  <Rig> And are any other members known?
[10-Aug-2014 20:57:07]  <Alicia> Rin flips the bird to Kazuki, walks off.
[10-Aug-2014 20:57:56]  <ponicalica> If the tailing petered out, then they should probably regroup, and then "Where's Rin?" etc
[10-Aug-2014 20:58:03]  <IllFlower> Rig: They're all presumed in hiding. The only reason anyone knows anything is because of the post-death investigation.
[10-Aug-2014 20:58:06]  <ponicalica> or wait no
[10-Aug-2014 20:58:12]  <BGTB2005> Leaning against a wall elsewhere in the city, Rin, scrolls through her phone's contact list, selecting Narumi's number and pressing 'dial'
[10-Aug-2014 20:58:21]  <BGTB2005> (sod it let's have some conflict)
[10-Aug-2014 20:58:57]  <ponicalica> maybe Shii told Ayako where they were
[10-Aug-2014 20:59:18]  <Rig> Shii called Ayako to complain about being kicked out of her office by Kazuki.
[10-Aug-2014 20:59:26]  <Rig> They went and stewed together about how much they hate Kazuki.
[10-Aug-2014 20:59:43]  <IllFlower> "Hello?" Narumi's voice is masked somewhat by the sound of passing trains.
[10-Aug-2014 21:00:46]  <IllFlower> "Might I ask who I'm speaking to?"
[10-Aug-2014 21:02:27]  <BGTB2005> "Hi, Narumi? It's Rin."
[10-Aug-2014 21:03:37]  <IllFlower> "Rin? Oh, you're the Conservator from yesterday...
[10-Aug-2014 21:04:30]  <IllFlower> "Why are you calling? I just talked to your colleague Sakura a little while ago."
[10-Aug-2014 21:05:02]  <BGTB2005> "I found a place. Can you meet me at..." Rin reads the address of a nearby plate.
[10-Aug-2014 21:05:07]  <IllFlower> (Since none of the player characters introduce themselves, I'm going to give the NPCs the esoteric magical power of name divination!)
[10-Aug-2014 21:05:33]  <IllFlower> Narumi balks in confusion. "A place? A place for what?"
[10-Aug-2014 21:05:35]  <ponicalica> ("I met your colleague, the pompous one...")
[10-Aug-2014 21:05:58]  <Rig> All people in emdogs just operate on vague descriptions and precognizance.
[10-Aug-2014 21:05:58]  <BGTB2005> Rin probably introduced herself and gave the names of the other Conservators to Pyunpyun's other initiates
[10-Aug-2014 21:06:14]  <Alicia> You're very nice, Rin.

[10-Aug-2014 21:07:33]  <BGTB2005> "A private ceremony." She paused for a moment. "What did he tell you?"

[10-Aug-2014 21:08:32]  <IllFlower> "He said the whole thing was off. Even in private.
[10-Aug-2014 21:09:08]  <IllFlower> "One of my friends told me that the Conservators said that they'd allow a private ceremony, though.
[10-Aug-2014 21:09:24]  <IllFlower> "Wait, was that you? Or did something else...?"
[10-Aug-2014 21:09:57]  <BGTB2005> "What."
[10-Aug-2014 21:11:35]  <BGTB2005> "When we talked with the other initiates, Kazuki said he'd try to get you access to your sister's body and let you have a private ceremony."
[10-Aug-2014 21:12:42]  <Rig> Technically, I don’t think there would be much of a body left. Probably more of a soul gem or something equivalent.
[10-Aug-2014 21:13:03]  <BGTB2005> yeah I think cremation's the norm in Japan
[10-Aug-2014 21:13:10]  <IllFlower> Rin hears Narumi mutter "Ritsuko was right" under her breath.
[10-Aug-2014 21:14:09]  <IllFlower> "I -- I can't meet now," she then says. "Is tomorrow okay?"
[10-Aug-2014 21:14:55]  <IllFlower> There's a distinct edge of nervous panic to her voice.
[10-Aug-2014 21:15:02]  <BGTB2005> "...Yeah."
[10-Aug-2014 21:16:20]  <IllFlower> "Thanks. Until then."
[10-Aug-2014 21:16:27]  <IllFlower> Narumi doesn't wait for Rin's response before hanging up.
[10-Aug-2014 21:17:00]  <Rig> Suspicious!
[10-Aug-2014 21:17:10]  <Rig> No one is innocent!
[10-Aug-2014 21:17:15]  <Rig> Gaze into the fist of HIKARI!
[10-Aug-2014 21:17:27]  <Alicia> Hikari is gonna be so pissed.
[10-Aug-2014 21:17:38]  <ponicalica> I think everyone is going to be pissed.
[10-Aug-2014 21:17:43]  <BGTB2005> Kazuki's likely going to be gazing into the fist of Rin real soon
[10-Aug-2014 21:18:14]  <ponicalica> maybe Ayako will take Kazuki's side, but still be pissed at the whole lying thing
[10-Aug-2014 21:18:45]  <Alicia> "You ticked me off, but you're not Rin."
[10-Aug-2014 21:18:52]  <IllFlower> Man, I am loving this so much right now.
[10-Aug-2014 21:19:22]  <IllFlower> I was worried this arc was going to be too simple, but instead it's getting more complicated by the second!
[10-Aug-2014 21:19:39]  <IllFlower> Anyway, what's happening next?
[10-Aug-2014 21:19:41]  <Rig> Well, we could have made it simple. But let’s drag this shit out. This is what dogs is for.
[10-Aug-2014 21:19:54]  <Rig> Well, what does Rin do with the information she has?
[10-Aug-2014 21:20:18]  <Rig> Kazuki is probably somewhere trying to research some shit or crying about Yuuya.
[10-Aug-2014 21:20:20]  <BGTB2005> seek out Kazuki to punch him in his lying face?
[10-Aug-2014 21:20:31]  <Rig> I’m good with that.
[10-Aug-2014 21:20:48]  <Alicia> I can see Hikari stepping up to defend him, even though she's wishy-washy about him.
[10-Aug-2014 21:21:01]  <IllFlower> Hikari's one true love is Wataru, after all.
[10-Aug-2014 21:21:27]  <Alicia> "You will not punch him, and you shall not attack him - and thus the Order!"
[10-Aug-2014 21:21:32]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Hahah.
[10-Aug-2014 21:21:55]  <Alicia> Be way brb I need to get something to drink.
[10-Aug-2014 21:21:56]  <Alicia> By*
[10-Aug-2014 21:21:57]  <ponicalica> Ayako's probably done stewing in the library or something and now heading back to Shii's HQ for a "wtf next" or something
[10-Aug-2014 21:22:04]  <BGTB2005> not even Kazuki's cat ears can save him for the Wrath of Rin
[10-Aug-2014 21:22:10]  <BGTB2005> *from
[10-Aug-2014 21:22:23]  <ponicalica> pretty sure the shippers are only empowered by the characters hating each other so
[10-Aug-2014 21:22:36]  <IllFlower> Wasn't there a word for hateshipping?
[10-Aug-2014 21:22:45]  <IllFlower> Other than "hateshipping"?
[10-Aug-2014 21:23:03]  <Rig> Kismesis.
[10-Aug-2014 21:23:06]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I'll let you guys take the reins.
[10-Aug-2014 21:23:08]  <ponicalica> I can only think of the Homestuck term, that one
[10-Aug-2014 21:23:28]  <Rig> Okay, so Kazuki is sitting in the library at the Order HQ or something.
[10-Aug-2014 21:23:31]  <Alicia> Back.
[10-Aug-2014 21:23:37]  <IllFlower> It doesn't look like you guys are going to be interacting with any NPCs so I'm going to let you all destroy each other.
[10-Aug-2014 21:23:39]  <Rig> Minding his shit, reading a book about memorial ceremonies.
[10-Aug-2014 21:24:02]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yeah, that thing.
[10-Aug-2014 21:24:59]  <Alicia> Hikari is probably hanging around the area too, doing Hikari things.
[10-Aug-2014 21:25:09]  <Alicia> Reading about The Order.
[10-Aug-2014 21:25:26]  <ponicalica> So the setting is that the Conservators are now all going to be in the library?
[10-Aug-2014 21:25:26]  <IllFlower> Or watching reruns of Law and Order.
[10-Aug-2014 21:25:31]  <IllFlower> One of the two.
[10-Aug-2014 21:25:38]  <Alicia> Most likely.
[10-Aug-2014 21:25:51]  <Rig> Hikari is always streaming Law and Order: Tokyo Victims Unit.
[10-Aug-2014 21:25:56]  <IllFlower> Is Rin going to storm in, much to the chagrin of the poor Librarian?
[10-Aug-2014 21:27:10]  <Alicia> "I'd like to check out.... one lying jerk. I won't be returning it."
[10-Aug-2014 21:27:15]  <BGTB2005> something like that
[10-Aug-2014 21:28:04]  <IllFlower> lol, the librarian isn't one of our fifty named characters. I guess it's for the best.
[10-Aug-2014 21:28:15]  <Alicia> Lucky them.
[10-Aug-2014 21:28:58]  <IllFlower> Well, if you're going to be doing any storming, best do it now before the Library closes!
[10-Aug-2014 21:30:37]  <BGTB2005> +decide 1|2
[10-Aug-2014 21:30:37]  <rollermine> BGTB2005: 2
[10-Aug-2014 21:31:34]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: what's this
[10-Aug-2014 21:32:15]  <BGTB2005> ponicalica: was trying to decide who she got Kazuki's general location off of
[10-Aug-2014 21:33:17]  <BGTB2005> 1 was Hikari, 2 was Kazuki, though now I'm thinking he might not be willing to have told Rin where he was, even without knowing what she was going to do
[10-Aug-2014 21:33:41]  <BGTB2005> anyways, that's not important now
[10-Aug-2014 21:33:57]  <IllFlower> Arguably, it doesn't really matter. Maybe Rin dramatically stormed into several different places before finding the right one. I think that would suit her.
[10-Aug-2014 21:34:04]  <Rig> It would.
[10-Aug-2014 21:34:07]  <Alicia> Hahah, yeah.
[10-Aug-2014 21:34:24]  <Rig> Rin storms into a ramen shop. Rin storms out of ramen shop when there is no Kazuki.
[10-Aug-2014 21:34:25]  <IllFlower> "KAZUKI YOU LYING SON OF A-- oh, wait, he's not here.
[10-Aug-2014 21:34:32]  <IllFlower> "Uh, sorry, Shii." "Uh-huh."
[10-Aug-2014 21:34:32]  <Rig> Rin comes back and gets ramen a minute later.
[10-Aug-2014 21:35:23]  <Alicia> Rin storms into the wrong half of the library, walks out angrily. Kazuki is confused at to what the ruckus was, and goes back to moping.
[10-Aug-2014 21:35:32]  <Alicia> as*
[10-Aug-2014 21:35:32]  <IllFlower> Shii then mutters to herself, "What's even the point of having an office..."
[10-Aug-2014 21:35:46]  <ponicalica> Rin storms into the other part of the library, sees Ayako, gives one good punch and runs out angrily.
[10-Aug-2014 21:36:21]  <BGTB2005> Arriving at the library, Rin barges through the front door and heads towards the Librarian.
[10-Aug-2014 21:36:37]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: <Ayako> What did the desk even do to her...?
[10-Aug-2014 21:36:48]  <Rig> IllFlower: What’s the color legend on the Summary sheet?
[10-Aug-2014 21:36:56]  <IllFlower> Rig: Male/female. Red means deceased.
[10-Aug-2014 21:37:03]  <Rig> Ah
[10-Aug-2014 21:37:33]  <BGTB2005> right now I don't think Rin's mad enough at Ayako to punch her
[10-Aug-2014 21:37:42]  <ponicalica> no, that was a joke >_>
[10-Aug-2014 21:37:50]  <BGTB2005> yeah, so?
[10-Aug-2014 21:37:55]  <IllFlower> So, uh, what's Rin doing to the poor Librarian?
[10-Aug-2014 21:38:08]  <Rig> Just shaking him.
[10-Aug-2014 21:38:10]  <Rig> Back and forth.
[10-Aug-2014 21:38:11]  <IllFlower> If this keeps up, "poor" is going to have to become part of her title.
[10-Aug-2014 21:38:16]  <Rig> Forgetting why she’s here.
[10-Aug-2014 21:38:17]  <IllFlower> "The poor Poor Librarian..."
[10-Aug-2014 21:38:33]  <BGTB2005> asking her if she knows which section Kazuki's in
[10-Aug-2014 21:40:40]  <IllFlower> The Librarian gives Rin a stern look. "Whatever it is you're here for, it's no excuse to make such a racket. I don't know where your Kazuki is, but I doubt you'll have to look for him anyway. He probably already knows you're here."
[10-Aug-2014 21:41:17]  <IllFlower> A diminutive girl working behind the main circulation counter snickers. Rin's sure she's seen her before, but can't recall who she is. It's no matter right now anyway.
[10-Aug-2014 21:42:17]  <ponicalica> ("I'm surprised you don't recognize your big sister Chiaki")
[10-Aug-2014 21:42:47]  <BGTB2005> (It's not that important at the moment anyways)
[10-Aug-2014 21:42:54]  <IllFlower> In any case, confident that she's shut Rin up for at least a little while, the Librarian stalks off to patrol the stacks.
[10-Aug-2014 21:43:22]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: It's someone Ayako would definitely recognize, but she's not here! What a shame.
[10-Aug-2014 21:43:27]  <IllFlower> But, yeah, it's not that important.
[10-Aug-2014 21:43:32]  <Alicia> (You don't distract a Rin from her mission. It's impossible.)
[10-Aug-2014 21:43:42]  <IllFlower> I suppose Kazuki would indeed have already seen Rin making her scene.
[10-Aug-2014 21:43:51]  <BGTB2005> (Well, you can, but you do so at your own peril.)
[10-Aug-2014 21:44:22]  <ponicalica> At this point I assume Ayako and Hikari will show up in the middle of the Rin/Kazuki conflict
[10-Aug-2014 21:44:36]  <Rig> Kazuki hears Rin making a ruckus and gets up to go see what she needs.
[10-Aug-2014 21:45:00]  <Rig> “Rin,” Kazuki says, trying to keep his voice down as he approaches the girl. “What is it?"
[10-Aug-2014 21:45:13]  <Alicia> Hikari is patrolling the area and browsing the books.
[10-Aug-2014 21:45:33]  <IllFlower> Ruckus? Time to put on some Wu-Tang Clan.
[10-Aug-2014 21:46:14]  <ponicalica> Maybe Hikari found Ayako and she's trying to teach her magic but Hikari's getting bored.
[10-Aug-2014 21:47:03]  <Alicia> "I can already so some! proceeds to accidentally knock over a pile of books Why must it all be so needlessly fancy, Ayako?"
[10-Aug-2014 21:48:28]  <BGTB2005> "Kazuki..." Rin's expression changes and she adjusts her stance as he draws nearer. "You LYING BASTARD!" She throws a punch at his face.
[10-Aug-2014 21:48:44]  <ponicalica> "It's a long tradition stretching back c-"
[10-Aug-2014 21:50:33]  <Rig> Kazuki is stunned and falls back from the punch. “What the hell?” he looks up at the angry girl standing above him now. “What the hell?”
[10-Aug-2014 21:51:06]  <IllFlower> Good thing the both of them only have 3 Bd, right?
[10-Aug-2014 21:51:45]  <IllFlower> Well, if this goes to actual fisticuffs Kazuki's pretty much screwed, but eh.
[10-Aug-2014 21:52:00]  <Alicia> Oops.
[10-Aug-2014 21:55:01]  <ponicalica> What are the stakes?  Does Rin just want to beat up on Kazuki?
[10-Aug-2014 21:55:54]  <Rig> Kazuki stands up, his hand pressed to the place where Rin’s punch landed. “What is your problem?"
[10-Aug-2014 21:56:54]  <BGTB2005> Rin's not exactly in a diplomatic mood, but I guess she'd try and get Kazuki to reconsider?
[10-Aug-2014 21:58:12]  <IllFlower> Well, let's do a little bit of talking before we actually jump into conflict.
[10-Aug-2014 21:58:13]  <Rig> Well, we could start a conflict, but I don’t think Kazuki gets to define stakes here.
[10-Aug-2014 21:58:33]  <IllFlower> So far I haven't actually seen anyone declare conflicting interests yet.
[10-Aug-2014 21:58:54]  <IllFlower> Except that Kazuki probably doesn't want Rin to wail on him, but Rin's only thrown the one punch. So far.
[10-Aug-2014 22:00:41]  <Alicia> I think Rin might be trying to persuade him?
[10-Aug-2014 22:01:51]  <IllFlower> We know that, but Kazuki hasn't been told enough to think anything but "this girl crazy."
[10-Aug-2014 22:01:58]  <ponicalica> which to be fair is true
[10-Aug-2014 22:02:32]  <Rig> (Kazuki taps his foot impatiently waiting for an explaination for his new bruise.)
[10-Aug-2014 22:02:43]  <BGTB2005> (Rin wants to let Narumi go through with the ceremony, but mostly now she just wanted to punch a lying liar in the face.)
[10-Aug-2014 22:02:58]  <Alicia> If anyone is going to have a chance of persuading Rin, it might be Hikari with her entire 1d4. So.
[10-Aug-2014 22:03:40]  <BGTB2005> Ayako has 1d4 with Rin
[10-Aug-2014 22:03:59]  <Rig> So what’s the next move?
[10-Aug-2014 22:04:28]  <Alicia> Also, I could see Kazuki trying to Kazuki it up in front of Rin and just pissing her off more. "Stop trying to be 'diplomatic'" etc.
[10-Aug-2014 22:04:58]  <IllFlower> I dunno, I think I need some more dialogue before we start rolling dice.
[10-Aug-2014 22:05:01]  <Alicia> Which would lead to "stop punching me" or "please stop punching me"...
[10-Aug-2014 22:05:11]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Yeah.
[10-Aug-2014 22:05:41]  <ponicalica> maybe something like "How can you tell Namuri's friends that you're going to allow the ceremony and then deny it to her!"
[10-Aug-2014 22:05:43]  <IllFlower> If we're even rolling dice, which I'm a bit loath to do.
[10-Aug-2014 22:05:54]  <Rig> Well, I mean, I can have Kazuki repeat “What the hell?” a few more times.
[10-Aug-2014 22:05:58]  <ponicalica> except, you know, spell Narumi right
[10-Aug-2014 22:06:14]  <IllFlower> I prefer the way where you guys just dramatically yell at each other.
[10-Aug-2014 22:06:54]  <Alicia> IMO yell it out.
[10-Aug-2014 22:07:29]  <ponicalica> "KAZUKIIIII!" "RIIIIIIIIN!"
[10-Aug-2014 22:07:37]  <Rig> “HAMTARO!”
[10-Aug-2014 22:08:14]  <IllFlower> YOU HEAR THAT BGTB2005 I WANT SOME RIN YELLING
[10-Aug-2014 22:09:17]  <BGTB2005> "What the hell indeed! You tell me and Narumi's friends she can have her own ceremony, and then you tell her she can't!"
[10-Aug-2014 22:10:49]  <Rig> “Do you really think we could let someone jeopardize the Order like that?” Kazuki starts to shout back. He catches himself recieving a glare from the poor Librarian and lowers his voice. “I mean, if you want we could just start a newletter for all the cultists telling them how much we love them.”
[10-Aug-2014 22:11:35]  <Alicia> Hikari picks the books back up. "Ayako, I think Rin's doing something here." She comments quickly, before heading off towards the screaming girl.
[10-Aug-2014 22:11:59]  <Alicia> Rig: Sassy.
[10-Aug-2014 22:12:22]  <ponicalica> "Mmm."  Ayako quickly arranges the books into something vaguely resembling order and then heads off behind Hikari
[10-Aug-2014 22:12:30]  <Rig> Sakura “Z-Snap” Kazuki
[10-Aug-2014 22:12:48]  <ponicalica> >Japanese name order
[10-Aug-2014 22:13:56]  <Rig> >assumptions about names
[10-Aug-2014 22:17:27]  <IllFlower> I want to try and wrap this session up in about 45 minutes, so let's reach deep down and get in touch with our inner yelling selves.
[10-Aug-2014 22:17:42]  <Rig> Yeah, I need to leave by 7pm. I have a date.
[10-Aug-2014 22:19:57]  <BGTB2005> Unable to articulate a reply, Rin clenches her fists and prepares to throw another punch
[10-Aug-2014 22:20:18]  <ponicalica> Rin: still not much of a talker
[10-Aug-2014 22:20:40]  <IllFlower> Is Hikari or Ayako going to intercede?
[10-Aug-2014 22:20:59]  <Alicia> Yeah I was planning on having Hikari intervene all "woah girl" and stuff.
[10-Aug-2014 22:21:01]  <ponicalica> Ayako reaches the situation.  "What...what the hell is going on?  Rin, why are you punching yet another fellow Conservator?"
[10-Aug-2014 22:21:08]  <Alicia> ponicalica, thoughts?
[10-Aug-2014 22:21:12]  <Alicia> intervene physically*
[10-Aug-2014 22:21:24]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: "If I punch ten, I get the next one free."
[10-Aug-2014 22:21:30]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[10-Aug-2014 22:21:40]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: punch three Conservators, get one wish
[10-Aug-2014 22:21:59]  <IllFlower> ANYWAY KEEP TALKING
[10-Aug-2014 22:22:49]  <Rig> Kazuki steps back behind Ayako. “She just started attacking me. She wants to actually let those initiates have a ceremony.”
[10-Aug-2014 22:23:23]  <IllFlower> IF THE CONVERSATION GOES DEAD I WILL SWEEP IT UNDER THE RUG AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SCENE SO SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE
[10-Aug-2014 22:23:39]  <ponicalica> Ayako steps back, puzzled.  "So did you, though.  I don't see why she'd be punching you."
[10-Aug-2014 22:23:51]  <BGTB2005> "Just Narumi, like you said yesterday."
[10-Aug-2014 22:24:00]  <Alicia> Hikari pushes her way in front of Rin, adding distance between her and Kazuki. "Rin, Rin... just what do you think you're doing!?" She barely keeps herself from yelling.
[10-Aug-2014 22:24:31]  <Rig> “No, I just told them that. I told Narumi that she couldn’t.”
[10-Aug-2014 22:24:56]  <Rig> Kazuki steps back, “Seriously, is Hikari the only one who can keep up in this group?”
[10-Aug-2014 22:25:12]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.13.247.53> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Aug-2014 22:25:31]  <Rig> “First, you nearly kill a suspect… my friend… and then you storm away when we’re in the middle of a case.”
[10-Aug-2014 22:25:46]  <Rig> “Then you come back and accuse me of not having the Order’s best interests in mind.”
[10-Aug-2014 22:26:13]  <Alicia> Hikari lowers her arms, but stands firmly in front of her. "You're not going to keep punching him, Rin.
[10-Aug-2014 22:26:16]  <Alicia> "
[10-Aug-2014 22:26:35]  <Rig> “Yes, I lied. I did my job. I didn’t kill anyone. In fact, for the first time since this group formed no one is in the hospital.”
[10-Aug-2014 22:26:48]  <Rig> Kazuki rounds on Rin. “Or were you planning on keeping your streak going!?”
[10-Aug-2014 22:26:56]  <ponicalica> wait is Kazuki supposed to know about the previous cases
[10-Aug-2014 22:27:09]  <BGTB2005> "Try and stop me."
[10-Aug-2014 22:27:28]  <Alicia> "That is not how the Order works-" Hikari pauses, flashes of the Yuuya case and times before coming back." "..."
[10-Aug-2014 22:27:40]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:7554:41d1:cdec:3c39> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Aug-2014 22:28:19]  <Alicia> "I will, Rin. I won't allow you to harm another Conservator, and so flagrantly go against the Order. You will have to go through me." Hikari stares Rin down.
[10-Aug-2014 22:29:35]  <Rig> “Hikari,” Kazuki stands next to the girl. “It’s not worth it. I think Narumi is going to do something drastic and we need to stop her.” Kazuki glares at the other two. “And they don’t seem to want to help.”
[10-Aug-2014 22:30:00]  <Rig> “Let’s get Shii and Pyunpyun and got take Narumi into custody. We’ll work the rest of this out later.”
[10-Aug-2014 22:30:15]  <Rig> *go take
[10-Aug-2014 22:30:30]  <Rig> Satisfactory amount of yelling, IllFlower?
[10-Aug-2014 22:30:32]  <IllFlower> Under what evidence?
[10-Aug-2014 22:31:10]  <Rig> The phone call we overheard earlier. The unspoken acknowledgement that she was going to do this even without our permission.
[10-Aug-2014 22:31:12]  *** Nitya_ <~Glossina@75-164-170-198.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Aug-2014 22:31:24]  *** Nitya <~Glossina@75-164-170-198.ptld.qwest.net> has quit IRC (Read error: No route to host)
[10-Aug-2014 22:31:31]  <Rig> It’s not like we’ve needed evidence before anyway.
[10-Aug-2014 22:31:34]  <BGTB2005> The one with rin or the earlier one?
[10-Aug-2014 22:31:35]  <IllFlower> Are you going to barge into her house?
[10-Aug-2014 22:31:44]  <Alicia> Hikari sighs, taking it in. "... sure. Let's continue keeping an eye on Narumi." She follows after Kazuki.
[10-Aug-2014 22:32:02]  <Rig> I have a sneaking suspicion that she’s probably not at her house.
[10-Aug-2014 22:32:09]  <IllFlower> She's at her house.
[10-Aug-2014 22:32:17]  <Rig> Fuck your directorial fiat!
[10-Aug-2014 22:32:24]  <Alicia> Hahaha.
[10-Aug-2014 22:32:26]  <Rig> I say she’s guilty of something!
[10-Aug-2014 22:33:12]  <IllFlower> Well, she's not going to be going anywhere until school tomorrow morning, at the earliest.
[10-Aug-2014 22:33:26]  <Rig> We can at least meet with Shii and Pyunpyun and discuss removing her powers temporarily.
[10-Aug-2014 22:33:38]  <Alicia> In any case, I do doubt Kazuki wants to continue risk getting wailed on by an angry Conservator.
[10-Aug-2014 22:33:45]  <IllFlower> That's fine by me. When? Now?
[10-Aug-2014 22:33:46]  <Alicia> Unless, uh, he does.
[10-Aug-2014 22:33:56]  <Rig> Or we can start a knock down drag out fight in the library.
[10-Aug-2014 22:34:06]  <Rig> See if we can get all the PCs killed in one swoop.
[10-Aug-2014 22:34:15]  <Rig> IllFlower: Yeah, probably.
[10-Aug-2014 22:34:20]  <Alicia> Noo, nooooo.
[10-Aug-2014 22:34:25]  <Alicia> D:
[10-Aug-2014 22:34:25]  <IllFlower> The Librarian kills the whole party out of annoyance.
[10-Aug-2014 22:34:45]  <IllFlower> All right, then.
[10-Aug-2014 22:34:48]  <Rig> That’d be a good place to wrap this up. The group standing in Shii’s office glaring daggers across the sparsely furnished room.
[10-Aug-2014 22:35:10]  <Rig> I realize sparsely furnished is doing the room too much justice.
[10-Aug-2014 22:35:28]  <IllFlower> Kazuki, intent on executing his plan of action, calls Shii and Pyunpyun in for a meeting in the disused chapel offices.
[10-Aug-2014 22:36:38]  <IllFlower> Rin, not wanting to give Shii any reason to suspect she might be up to anything, follows along, though she spends most of her time glaring daggers from the back of the room just as Kazuki had earlier.
[10-Aug-2014 22:37:25]  <IllFlower> It's well into the evening by the time everyone's assembled. Pyunpyun seems quite frazzled.
[10-Aug-2014 22:37:28]  <Alicia> Hikari hangs off to the side, keeping an eye on Rin and Kazuki.
[10-Aug-2014 22:37:37]  <IllFlower> All right, Rig, take it away.
[10-Aug-2014 22:38:02]  <ponicalica> Ayako hangs in the back as well, looking a bit shaken from what's happened.
[10-Aug-2014 22:38:14]  <Rig> Kazuki stands before the two familars and ignores Rin with as much effort as is politely possible.
[10-Aug-2014 22:39:30]  <Rig> “Pyunpyun is already aware that one of his initiates approached us earlier today and asked us to convince him to allow a memorial service for her deceased sister. As her sister died a cult leader in a botched possession the Order expressly forbids the service.”
[10-Aug-2014 22:39:47]  *** Nitya_ is now known as Nitya
[10-Aug-2014 22:39:51]  <Rig> “We have reason to believe that Narumi will attempt to perform the service on her own.”
[10-Aug-2014 22:40:12]  <ponicalica> Ayako thinks "For example, you told her friends that she'd be able to."
[10-Aug-2014 22:40:58]  <BGTB2005> Thinking of having Rin voice those thoughts
[10-Aug-2014 22:41:15]  <IllFlower> Shii looks like she's on the verge of saying something, but Pyunpyun interrupts before she can commit any words to voice.
[10-Aug-2014 22:41:17]  <Rig> “I’m requesting the temporary removal of her powers pending the passing of the anniversary of Hatsue’s death and a review of her competency to act in the Order’s interests."
[10-Aug-2014 22:41:27]  <Rig> Sorry, had to phrase that right.
[10-Aug-2014 22:41:46]  <IllFlower> "That won't be necessary. Probably."
[10-Aug-2014 22:42:37]  <Alicia> "Then what do you have in mind, Shii? This has already gotten someewhat out of hand, even before Kazuki had to call you two up..."
[10-Aug-2014 22:42:40]  * IllFlower waits for Kazuki's inevitable incredulous response
[10-Aug-2014 22:43:04]  <IllFlower> Shii looks at Pyunpyun with as much surprise as the assembled Conservators.
[10-Aug-2014 22:43:14]  <Rig> "NAN DAI YO!”
[10-Aug-2014 22:43:16]  <Rig> Sorry.
[10-Aug-2014 22:43:34]  <IllFlower> "Nande yanen!"
[10-Aug-2014 22:43:38]  <Rig> “What? You suggested it yourself!”
[10-Aug-2014 22:44:27]  <IllFlower> "Narumi called me about fifteen minutes ago to tender her resignation.
[10-Aug-2014 22:44:36]  <IllFlower> "As well as those of... five... of my other initiates.
[10-Aug-2014 22:44:53]  <Rig> (Honestly, this worked out pretty much how I hoped.)
[10-Aug-2014 22:44:59]  <IllFlower> "She said they've arranged to meet for the ritual in my quarters tomorrow morning."
[10-Aug-2014 22:45:48]  <ponicalica> "Have they given a concrete reason for their resignation?"
[10-Aug-2014 22:46:09]  <Rig> Kazuki says nothing. He’s stunned that six initiates would all resign at once. It’s practically unheard of.
[10-Aug-2014 22:46:26]  <IllFlower> "No," Pyunpyun says, "but it doesn't take much guessing."
[10-Aug-2014 22:47:00]  <ponicalica> "They lost faith in the Order?  I wonder whose fault that could be..."
[10-Aug-2014 22:47:21]  <Rig> “They didn’t have much faith to start with,” Kazuki mutters.
[10-Aug-2014 22:48:54]  <IllFlower> "Faith or no faith, that should close this issue," Shii interjects.
[10-Aug-2014 22:48:58]  <Alicia> Hikari looks to Ayako briefly, pondering what to say, before focusing back on the familiars.
[10-Aug-2014 22:49:00]  <BGTB2005> Not sure if Rin's within earshot of that
[10-Aug-2014 22:49:17]  <ponicalica> They're all within earshot, I'd say
[10-Aug-2014 22:49:20]  <Rig> It’d help if she had cat ears.
[10-Aug-2014 22:49:25]  <ponicalica> the room's acoustics wouldn't be that bad I think
[10-Aug-2014 22:49:27]  <IllFlower> "I wish there were a more amicable resolution, but we'll have to take this one."
[10-Aug-2014 22:50:23]  <Rig> Kazuki nods.
[10-Aug-2014 22:51:07]  <Alicia> "That is fair..." Hikari responds quietly. "It's the best solution, perhaps."
[10-Aug-2014 22:51:07]  <ponicalica> Ayako also nods.
[10-Aug-2014 22:51:40]  <BGTB2005> Rin stays silent, but gives a small nod.
[10-Aug-2014 22:52:19]  <Alicia> ("You're a bunch of bastards, especially you two" she yells internally.)
[10-Aug-2014 22:53:07]  <IllFlower> So's that all?
[10-Aug-2014 22:53:15]  <Rig> Yeah, good place to drop curtain.
[10-Aug-2014 22:53:36]  <IllFlower> All right, then. We'll pick up on Saturday.
[10-Aug-2014 22:53:39]  <Rig> I hope I didn’t actually hurt anyone’s feelings playing Kazuki up as a huge bastard in the episode.
[10-Aug-2014 22:53:44]  <ponicalica> nah
[10-Aug-2014 22:53:44]  <Rig> It was lots of fun though.
[10-Aug-2014 22:54:17]  <IllFlower> Until then, thanks for playing, everyone.
