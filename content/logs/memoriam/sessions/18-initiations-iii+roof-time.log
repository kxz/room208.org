@time=2014-04-26T20:10:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Right, if you have anything left over from last branch, it'd be a good idea to get it out of the way now.
@time=2014-04-26T20:10:54.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :2d8→2d10 for "can handle dangerous magic" maybe, since while Ayako suffered some for not running from violence, she did pretty well megucally...

@time=2014-04-26T20:11:42.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: I did the fallout, so it's only post-town reflection.  For both Alicia/Hikari and myself/Ayako, I believe

@time=2014-04-26T20:15:30.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also IllFlower, thinking about adding a stat point to Bd.
@time=2014-04-26T20:15:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: Works for me. Hikari is a rather physical character.

@time=2014-04-26T20:20:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I get the sense she'd step in and do it anyway. Whether or not she succeeds, now, that might be an interesting way to play it.

If I hadn't bumped up the "dangerous magic" thing I think bumping up Ac would be suitable but as it is that feels a bit like double-dipping
