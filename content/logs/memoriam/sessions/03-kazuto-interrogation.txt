[21-Aug-2013 01:20:46]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's get started.
[21-Aug-2013 01:23:12]  <IllFlower> The three girls, having managed to snatch Kazuto after a grueling chase, bring him to the Library to face the music.
[21-Aug-2013 01:23:51]  <Iverjun> ((Hitomi hits him with a record))
[21-Aug-2013 01:24:15]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((heehee.))
[21-Aug-2013 01:24:17]  <IllFlower> The chief librarian is overjoyed at getting one of her missing books back. "This is the first one we've managed to recover, after all this time where they've just been disappearing," she says. **
[21-Aug-2013 01:25:06]  <Iverjun> "Just been disappearing?" Jun asks. She glares at Kazuto. "Want to confess to something?"
[21-Aug-2013 01:25:07]  <ponicalica> "First one?  You mean this has been happening for a while?"  Ayako's shocked.
[21-Aug-2013 01:25:27]  *** AttObl|FortuneSummoners is now known as AttObl
[21-Aug-2013 01:25:49]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> "Yes, it's unfortunate we're the first ones to be able to do our job," Hitomi says impassively.
[21-Aug-2013 01:25:55]  <IllFlower> Kazuto, true to form, stays mum. **
[21-Aug-2013 01:26:50]  <Iverjun> Ignoring the silence Jun turns back to the librarian. "Do the missing books have something in common?"
[21-Aug-2013 01:28:37]  <IllFlower> The librarian picks a pair of glasses up from her desk, and rifles through the papers stacked nearby before pulling out a handwritten list. "Here," she says.
[21-Aug-2013 01:29:08]  <ponicalica> 14presumably Jun then immediately hands the paper to Ayako
[21-Aug-2013 01:29:11]  <IllFlower> "A lot of them are restricted texts. The one you returned just now isn't supposed to be read by anyone who's not a Conservator.
[21-Aug-2013 01:30:07]  <IllFlower> "Outside of that, there doesn't appear to be a whole lot in common. Books on witches, books on initiations, books on the history of the magical hierarchy..." **
[21-Aug-2013 01:31:36]  <ponicalica> "Sounds like they're trying to duplicate the magical world, almost."
[21-Aug-2013 01:31:57]  <ponicalica> 14wait that's probably way too far ahead fuck
[21-Aug-2013 01:31:58]  <Iverjun> Jun spends a moment looking at the list, but doesn't remember ever bothering to read any of these. "Bookworm," she says, passing the paper to Ayako.
[21-Aug-2013 01:32:09]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi glances at Kazuto. "I think Kazuto here's a little envious, myself." She reaches for her bag nonchalantly, recalls she's indoors, recalls she's indoors in a magical institution. Crosses her arms instead.
[21-Aug-2013 01:33:01]  <ponicalica> 14ignore my last line that was a bit jumpthegun >_<
[21-Aug-2013 01:33:17]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((lol no problem.))
[21-Aug-2013 01:33:20]  <Iverjun> ((Not particularly))
[21-Aug-2013 01:33:51]  <ponicalica> Ayako picks up the paper, scans the titles.  "Some of these look a bit esoteric even for me.  Whoever's getting these has to be rather knowledgable already, really."
[21-Aug-2013 01:34:04]  <Iverjun> Jun glances at Hitomi and then down at Kazuto. "Perhaps we should take him somewhere quiet and ask him a few questions." (The librarian points out that a library is, by nature, quiet.))
[21-Aug-2013 01:35:06]  <Iverjun> ((Basically, I think we should start a conflict to interrogate the boy))
[21-Aug-2013 01:36:15]  <IllFlower> The librarian smiles wryly. "I'll point out that the underground carrels used to be prison cells, back when this building was still a defensive fortification." **
[21-Aug-2013 01:37:31]  <ponicalica> "I suppose we should head down, then, and see if we can get the location of this boy's friends out of him."
[21-Aug-2013 01:37:40]  *** SpruceZeus|away is now known as SpruceZeus
[21-Aug-2013 01:38:12]  <Iverjun> ((This is where Hitomi is supposed to smirk and say "Let's go check out a good /heavy/ book, Kazuto."))
[21-Aug-2013 01:38:36]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi looks down at her soap-stained outfit once, then at Kazuto. "Sounds good enough. Librarian ((-san)), would you happen to have any more information for us before we see if Kazuto here can help us?"
[21-Aug-2013 01:38:41]  <ponicalica> ((I think she prefers the baton.))
[21-Aug-2013 01:39:28]  <IllFlower> "No, none. Do let me know if you find the rest of those books. I'll be ever so grateful."
[21-Aug-2013 01:40:01]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((no asterisks, hmmm)
[21-Aug-2013 01:40:02]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> )
[21-Aug-2013 01:40:04]  <IllFlower> The girls truck Kazuto downstairs. He doesn't resist being moved around, but he remains as silent as ever.
[21-Aug-2013 01:40:50]  <IllFlower> No matter how the place has been redecorated, it's hard to miss the fact that the carrels are a converted dungeon, now that the librarian has told them about it. **
[21-Aug-2013 01:41:57]  <Iverjun> "Kazuto, you really should just tell us what you're doing with the books."
[21-Aug-2013 01:42:09]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((Any reasonably big rooms, slightly larger than a cell? Otherwise we could put him in one, lock one of us in there and take turns if necessary.))
[21-Aug-2013 01:43:11]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi stays silent, surveying the carrels. She's clearly seeking out good spots for their investigation.
[21-Aug-2013 01:43:13]  <Iverjun> ((You can just make it up, man. Cooperative game))
[21-Aug-2013 01:43:20]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((True.))
[21-Aug-2013 01:44:08]  <ponicalica> ((I'm not really sure what to say/do at this point >_<)
[21-Aug-2013 01:44:10]  <ponicalica> ))
[21-Aug-2013 01:44:21]  <IllFlower> Kazuto glances from left to right at each of the three Conservators in turn. He finally sighs and looks at Jun. "I wanted to learn new things. Is that so bad?"
[21-Aug-2013 01:45:23]  <IllFlower> He says this in his usual flat tone, but the sarcasm is obvious. **
[21-Aug-2013 01:45:24]  <ponicalica> 14more talk or **?
[21-Aug-2013 01:45:55]  <ponicalica> "Somehow I feel that if this were a straightforward search for knowledge you wouldn't have started in the restricted section.  What're you actually doing with the books?"
[21-Aug-2013 01:46:01]  <Iverjun> Jun sighs. "It's a library, kid. You check the books out at the circulation desk. Not under your coat." She looks at Hitomi, giving her the secret sign to be the bad cop.
[21-Aug-2013 01:46:24]  <ponicalica> 14Jun and Ayako are talking over each other really badly, clearyl
[21-Aug-2013 01:46:37]  <IllFlower> Just flip the two lines around and it makes sense.
[21-Aug-2013 01:47:06]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> "A lot of these rooms are pretty small...oh, here's a group study." Hitomi walks ahead and opens a door, motioning the others. Eyes on Kazuto.
[21-Aug-2013 01:47:40]  <IllFlower> Oh, I thought we were already seated. Eh, whatever.
[21-Aug-2013 01:47:59]  <IllFlower> Proceed.
[21-Aug-2013 01:48:15]  <Iverjun> Jun guides their friend into a chair and pushes him down before taking a seat across the table from him.
[21-Aug-2013 01:48:32]  <Iverjun> ((This could all be exciting conflict stuff.))
[21-Aug-2013 01:49:03]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((I'm getting to it!)
[21-Aug-2013 01:49:04]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> )
[21-Aug-2013 01:50:23]  <IllFlower> If anyone wants to start conflict, I'm waiting for the say-so.
[21-Aug-2013 01:50:35]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> The room appears to be occupied by a six-person desk and five chairs. "Kazuto, sit at the end, please." Hitomi stands at the other end of the table, missing a chair. ((Alright, now I'll initiate conflict. Stakes are any leads on other thieves - associates, in particular.))
[21-Aug-2013 01:50:51]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> at the other end of the table, closest to the door and missing a chair.*
[21-Aug-2013 01:50:58]  <IllFlower> Okay, so you want Kazuto to spill on whether or not he's got accomplices?
[21-Aug-2013 01:51:13]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Yeah.
[21-Aug-2013 01:51:21]  <Iverjun> Sounds fair enough.
[21-Aug-2013 01:51:23]  <ponicalica> Well, I was kind of taking the whether as a given, and wanting info on them, but fair enough
[21-Aug-2013 01:51:33]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Whether?
[21-Aug-2013 01:51:40]  <ponicalica> Whether he had accomplices
[21-Aug-2013 01:51:44]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Ahh.
[21-Aug-2013 01:51:48]  <Iverjun> As in, he probably definitely has accomplices.
[21-Aug-2013 01:51:59]  <IllFlower> You know what I mean.
[21-Aug-2013 01:52:08]  <IllFlower> Okay, who's in?
[21-Aug-2013 01:52:11]  <ponicalica> I'm in.
[21-Aug-2013 01:52:29]  <ponicalica> Also, does this count as a follow-up for the purposes of bringing in the dice or is there too much separation?
[21-Aug-2013 01:52:30]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Would it be fair for us to gang up on him?
[21-Aug-2013 01:53:06]  <ponicalica> well he can do attacks on all of us at once, so
[21-Aug-2013 01:53:23]  <IllFlower> I think this works as a follow-up conflict.
[21-Aug-2013 01:53:26]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> I assumed Jun's comment earlier was "okay, hitomi's gonna do her job", but Ayako's expertise on the stuff he may say seems like it'd be very important here. So I'd want her alongside to see if he throws bullshit.
[21-Aug-2013 01:53:48]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Good cop bad cop requires a good cop too, of course...
[21-Aug-2013 01:53:56]  <Iverjun> I could be in for good cop, but I'll sit out and let Ayako take the roll.
[21-Aug-2013 01:54:15]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Alright, I'm gonna roll for non-physical first. Also, intimidating.
[21-Aug-2013 01:54:25]  * Barcode[YANO_Hitomi] drags up manual
[21-Aug-2013 01:54:28]  <IllFlower> Okay, so it's Kazuto vs. Hitomi and Ayako, then?
[21-Aug-2013 01:54:39]  <IllFlower> Talky conflict is Ac+Ht.
[21-Aug-2013 01:54:40]  <ponicalica> I think so, yeah.
[21-Aug-2013 01:54:41]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> I'm okay with that. Rig, ponny?
[21-Aug-2013 01:54:43]  <Iverjun> Jun touches Ayako's shoulder and looks at Hitomi. "Try to keep her in line." She then steps outside and leans against the door.
[21-Aug-2013 01:54:52]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((nice.))

[21-Aug-2013 01:57:37]  <IllFlower> One of you should raise first.

[21-Aug-2013 01:58:01]  <Iverjun> Hitomi probably should.
[21-Aug-2013 01:58:16]  <IllFlower> 122456 for Hitomi.
[21-Aug-2013 01:58:40]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Yeah, just thinking. Kinda wanna split up Conservator into Intimidation and Conservator at 1d10 each. Didn't use Conservator last battle, but then I'd be making a post-hoc mod to my character. (the effect would just be that I haven't had an /incredible/ maount of time as a magical girl, but still enough to be d10 instead of d6...)
[21-Aug-2013 01:59:01]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> I'm gonna type up a Raise right now either case. I'm fine with leaving the stat alone, don't worry.
[21-Aug-2013 01:59:13]  <ponicalica> well I think bringing in Conservator would work the way it's written
[21-Aug-2013 01:59:29]  <ponicalica> since you're in a position where you get to use it as a power
[21-Aug-2013 01:59:38]  <IllFlower> Let's leave it alone for now. ponicalica has a point, if you want to play this as "I have power over this guy."
[21-Aug-2013 01:59:46]  <IllFlower> But you can bring that in whenever.
[21-Aug-2013 02:00:12]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> I was ognna say, maybe I can counter any kind of deceit magic he might be using...could I just get an indication should he be doing that, and then if so I'll bring it in?
[21-Aug-2013 02:00:37]  <IllFlower> Deceit magic?
[21-Aug-2013 02:00:46]  <ponicalica> Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]: are you still going to raise first?
[21-Aug-2013 02:00:49]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ponicalica: yeah.
[21-Aug-2013 02:00:50]  <IllFlower> I'm not sure where this comes in.
[21-Aug-2013 02:01:00]  <ponicalica> this isn't a magical-level conflict yet, Barcode
[21-Aug-2013 02:01:01]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Yeah, actually, I can't think of a way to make lying magical. never mind.
[21-Aug-2013 02:01:18]  <Iverjun> This is not the Kazuto you're looking for.
[21-Aug-2013 02:01:48]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: 2233345566. You missed a 6.
[21-Aug-2013 02:02:03]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: hahaha, thanks :}
[21-Aug-2013 02:02:12]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi closes her eyes and exhales. "Alright, Kazuto. This is about as end-of-the-line as it gets for you. There's probably some additional punishment in store for you after we get our answers, but I can guarantee you anything you tell us now is not going to compare to what I'll do to you when I smell your bullshit." ((one more line))
[21-Aug-2013 02:02:43]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> the punishment you'll receive for anything extra you reveal to us is nothing compared to what I'll*

[21-Aug-2013 02:22:44]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> A different pair of dice from the first conflict, I assume?
[21-Aug-2013 02:22:54]  <ponicalica> yeah, different
[21-Aug-2013 02:23:06]  <IllFlower> They're all listed at the bottom of the character sheet.
[21-Aug-2013 02:23:13]  <ponicalica> first conflict he brought in 2d10 and a d4
[21-Aug-2013 02:23:55]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Right, sorry. I don't know how NPC traits work >_<
[21-Aug-2013 02:24:13]  <ponicalica> basically he can choose what the traits mean when he needs to
[21-Aug-2013 02:25:11]  <IllFlower> Kazuto merely repeats himself. "Perhaps the initiates you know would have to work with others. The ones I know do not." See 56, leave 112344. **
[21-Aug-2013 02:25:23]  <IllFlower> Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]: You're up.
[21-Aug-2013 02:27:25]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> I'm just raising, right?
[21-Aug-2013 02:27:28]  <IllFlower> Yes.
[21-Aug-2013 02:27:52]  <IllFlower> This looks like it's not going Kazuto's way, so don't be surprised if he tries to pull a runner.

[21-Aug-2013 02:30:41]  <IllFlower> 6d6+2d10 is nothing to scoff at, after all.
[21-Aug-2013 02:31:19]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> "You're right. Who says you're working with others?" Hitomi begins to stand, leaning in a bit. "You just happen to know others who do the same. Independently, of course. But you know them all the same." She takes on a more threatening tone. "Nishimori, if I don't like your next answer I'm gonna get a little more serious. Who. Are. The other thieves?" Raise 52. Leave 16.
[21-Aug-2013 02:32:19]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((PS Lorn's Nothing Else album is fun. Automation is Hitomi's Theme atm))
[21-Aug-2013 02:33:26]  <IllFlower> Kazuto eyes the baton clipped to Hitomi's belt. "It took three of you to catch me..." he says, as if thinking to himself. See 34, leave 1124.
[21-Aug-2013 02:34:00]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@108-91-87-34.lightspeed.cicril.sbcglobal.net> has joined #madokamadness
[21-Aug-2013 02:34:06]  <ponicalica> If he does pull a runner, should we expect Jun to help too?
[21-Aug-2013 02:34:17]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> he'd have to get through Jun leaning /against/ the door, for that matter.
[21-Aug-2013 02:35:10]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Unless he gets a bit creative.
[21-Aug-2013 02:35:41]  <IllFlower> He then shifts his eyes to the door behind Ayako and Hitomi, remembering that the door opens inward.
[21-Aug-2013 02:35:54]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((Heheh.))
[21-Aug-2013 02:36:01]  <IllFlower> "Well, then, let's see how the two of you do."
[21-Aug-2013 02:36:30]  <IllFlower> He swiftly stands up and vaults himself over the table, heading straight for the exit.
[21-Aug-2013 02:36:40]  <IllFlower> I'm escalating to physical. Roll Bd, everyone.
[21-Aug-2013 02:36:48]  <Iverjun> Including myself?
[21-Aug-2013 02:37:02]  <ponicalica> I think so, though you'd roll Bd+Ht I think
[21-Aug-2013 02:37:02]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> +roll 4d6
[21-Aug-2013 02:37:02]  <rollermine> Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]: (5+4+5+6)=20

[21-Aug-2013 02:38:41]  <ponicalica> Barcode[YANO_Hitomi], Iverjun: what do you think?
[21-Aug-2013 02:39:50]  <IllFlower> Actually, looking at the dice, it looks like things are going to go pretty well for you guys...
[21-Aug-2013 02:40:00]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> oh right, I'm 145566.
[21-Aug-2013 02:40:06]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> vaulting across a six-person table, past the person standing on the other end...I figured I'd escalate to fighting and clothesline him or something. Assuming such a feat weren't magical, at which point, conservator could come into play.
[21-Aug-2013 02:40:12]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I raise 56, leaving 1111223456.
[21-Aug-2013 02:40:26]  <Iverjun> Well, we could do what IllFlower says, which might move the plot along a little. But on the other hand, I'm sure it won't take much to catch him.
[21-Aug-2013 02:40:35]  <Iverjun> Should I tap in?
[21-Aug-2013 02:40:39]  <ponicalica> Probably.
[21-Aug-2013 02:40:46]  <Iverjun> Since technically the conflict's stakes have changed.
[21-Aug-2013 02:40:58]  <IllFlower> Have they?
[21-Aug-2013 02:41:07]  <Iverjun> Well, now it's does he escape.
[21-Aug-2013 02:41:09]  <Iverjun> *agin
[21-Aug-2013 02:41:12]  <Iverjun> *again
[21-Aug-2013 02:41:18]  <IllFlower> I figure that if you catch him, he'll spill, knowing now for certain that he can't get away.
[21-Aug-2013 02:41:29]  <Iverjun> I'm fine with fighting him.
[21-Aug-2013 02:41:33]  <Iverjun> +roll 9d6

[21-Aug-2013 02:42:23]  <Iverjun> 2222234456, actually.
[21-Aug-2013 02:42:33]  <Iverjun> I believe it is Kazuto's raise?
[21-Aug-2013 02:42:40]  <ponicalica> Kazuto just raised 56
[21-Aug-2013 02:42:48]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> His raise is 56...so we'd have to See that, and decide from there.
[21-Aug-2013 02:42:59]  <Iverjun> So, one of you should see.
[21-Aug-2013 02:43:07]  <Iverjun> Probably the one you'd imagine as closest.
[21-Aug-2013 02:43:12]  <ponicalica> we all do I think?
[21-Aug-2013 02:43:36]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Say, I sorta-dodge the leap, he goes to open the door, I'm stumbling to get ready to go after him, Jun's ready right past it though?
[21-Aug-2013 02:44:10]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> at this point if hitomi gets her hands on him again she's gonna feed him shots until he gives names or doesn't have teeth.
[21-Aug-2013 02:44:14]  <IllFlower> All of you, unless Jun doesn't care about having the door opened out from behind her back.

[21-Aug-2013 02:44:47]  <ponicalica> Ayako notices Kazuto running off perhaps a moment later than she should have, but fast enough to start making chase as he heads for the door.  See 56, leave 2233344669.
[21-Aug-2013 02:45:46]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi dodges the impossibly fast vaulter, seeing him sail overhead for the door. See 56, leave 1456.
[21-Aug-2013 02:46:24]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Mind if I roll Conservator, for some experience with someone this fast, perhaps?
[21-Aug-2013 02:47:05]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> or, well, let's see what jun does first.
[21-Aug-2013 02:47:10]  <IllFlower> I also dunno if the way you've described the trait really comports with that.
[21-Aug-2013 02:47:15]  <Iverjun> Jun hears scuffling inside the study room and smiles. Hitomi must have resorted to punching already. Maybe giving Ayako the chain hadn't been the right choice after all. Suddenly the door opens behind her and she almost falls backward. She manages to catch herself on the frame through sheer luck.
[21-Aug-2013 02:48:00]  <IllFlower> See?
[21-Aug-2013 02:48:06]  <ponicalica> I'm considering making my next raise one that would include a roll for taking charge, in that she knows the layout of the library and can direct the others to actually surround him this time
[21-Aug-2013 02:48:12]  <Iverjun> See 326, leave 2222445. 1d6 Fallout taken.
[21-Aug-2013 02:48:15]  <Iverjun> *3d
[21-Aug-2013 02:48:29]  <Iverjun> Does anyone object to me raising?
[21-Aug-2013 02:48:36]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Nope. I want names.
[21-Aug-2013 02:48:36]  <IllFlower> No problem here.
[21-Aug-2013 02:48:42]  <ponicalica> I think I'm next to raise actually but go ahead
[21-Aug-2013 02:49:25]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: He has to go sometime. Whether it's before or after you is up to choice.

[21-Aug-2013 02:49:51]  <ponicalica> But I've described how I'm going to raise.  Would that make more sense before or after what you're going to do, Rig?
[21-Aug-2013 02:50:33]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ponicalica: JUst include it in your Raise description, I guess. Which would also include your additional dice, if you need em.
[21-Aug-2013 02:50:34]  <Iverjun> It really doesn't matter before or after what I plan to do.
[21-Aug-2013 02:50:57]  <IllFlower> Yeah, what the other two said.
[21-Aug-2013 02:51:17]  <ponicalica> Iverjun: Your choice.
[21-Aug-2013 02:51:32]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> I say let 'im go ahead. This action affects him most, at any rate.
[21-Aug-2013 02:51:50]  <Iverjun> Jun spins around, surprised, but her reflexes from kendo kick in. She sees the wormy boy and reacts with a a fist. The haymaker comes around fast and neat right at Kazuto's jaw. She's honestly tired of his shit.
[21-Aug-2013 02:52:02]  <IllFlower> Escalation?

[21-Aug-2013 02:53:32]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> heh.
[21-Aug-2013 02:53:45]  <Iverjun> Raise 55, leave 122222344.

[21-Aug-2013 02:55:43]  <Iverjun> As in the trait I had from last time.
[21-Aug-2013 02:56:05]  <IllFlower> That was from initiation, so it was only effective for the last conflict.
[21-Aug-2013 02:56:16]  <Iverjun> Okay then.
[21-Aug-2013 02:56:19]  <IllFlower> Kazuto, too busy focusing on how to get out of the room, doesn't notice Jun's fist until it's already flown into his head. See 2233, leave 1111223556, 4d6 fallout.
[21-Aug-2013 02:56:24]  <Iverjun> Forgot when it was from.
[21-Aug-2013 02:56:28]  <IllFlower> Ayako, you're up.

[21-Aug-2013 02:57:12]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Do we all have to be Escalated to the same level?
[21-Aug-2013 02:57:19]  <IllFlower> Yes.
[21-Aug-2013 02:57:20]  <ponicalica> escalation's automatic for everyone ,yeah
[21-Aug-2013 02:57:33]  <IllFlower> Unless you want to leave the conflict.
[21-Aug-2013 02:57:34]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ah, kay, so i gotta get in my Will.
[21-Aug-2013 02:57:41]  <IllFlower> ponicalica's 9 is giving me some serious headaches.

[21-Aug-2013 03:00:37]  <IllFlower> ponicalica?
[21-Aug-2013 03:00:43]  <ponicalica> Ayako notices the window of opportunity to keep this from a repeat of last time, as she brings her legs to kick down Kazuto, dazed by Jun's fist.  Raise 66, leave 22233344669.
[21-Aug-2013 03:00:47]  <ponicalica> brb bathroom
[21-Aug-2013 03:02:55]  <IllFlower> Kazuto is knocked to the ground by Ayako's well-placed kick, losing all semblance of forward momentum. See 2235, leave 111156, additional 4d6 fallout for 8d6 total.
[21-Aug-2013 03:03:26]  <ponicalica> back
[21-Aug-2013 03:03:48]  <Iverjun> Basically, he gonna die.
[21-Aug-2013 03:03:49]  <IllFlower> Actually, sorry, that should be 3d6+3d6=6d6 fallout. I forgot about Kazuto's Preservation trait.
[21-Aug-2013 03:05:09]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Iverjun: Just checking rules. He can't get any worse than a long-term injury, unless someone pulls a d8/d10 fallout on him.
[21-Aug-2013 03:05:16]  <Iverjun> Yeah.
[21-Aug-2013 03:05:43]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Anyway...
[21-Aug-2013 03:05:50]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> My Will.

[21-Aug-2013 03:05:56]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> lol.
[21-Aug-2013 03:06:13]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> 1456 plus that, 112456666.
[21-Aug-2013 03:06:30]  <IllFlower> He could have terrible luck and roll 6+6=12, in which case his injuries might be severe enough to merit medical attention.
[21-Aug-2013 03:06:36]  <Iverjun> Hitomi is ZA BEASTO
[21-Aug-2013 03:06:45]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((Hitomi becomes an eva.))
[21-Aug-2013 03:06:50]  <IllFlower> It is possible for him to die in the worst case.
[21-Aug-2013 03:07:01]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hm? I thought it was just his two highest...
[21-Aug-2013 03:07:03]  <ponicalica> (Hitomi becomes Sayaka in the Elsa Maria fight)
[21-Aug-2013 03:07:05]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Or, oh, medical attention, right.
[21-Aug-2013 03:07:19]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> No, wait. that's 16+, isn't it?
[21-Aug-2013 03:07:32]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Still two highest dice ,which are all d6...

[21-Aug-2013 03:07:35]  <IllFlower> It's possible to get to the 16-19 case from the 12-15 case.
[21-Aug-2013 03:07:37]  <ponicalica> 12 can go to 16 which can go to 10
[21-Aug-2013 03:07:39]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> oh, hm.
[21-Aug-2013 03:07:40]  <ponicalica> *20
[21-Aug-2013 03:08:33]  <Iverjun> So, Barcode[YANO_Hitomi], maybe don't raise with 66?
[21-Aug-2013 03:08:49]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> F'course. (also i don't see the "raise injury status" thing from the long-term fallout list >_>)
[21-Aug-2013 03:09:12]  <Iverjun> «Did your two highest dice sum to 12-15?»
[21-Aug-2013 03:09:16]  <Alicia> (Can I just say Hitomi is really entertaining so far.)
[21-Aug-2013 03:09:19]  <IllFlower> It's very unlikely that he's going to die. Unless he has terrible luck, he'll be able to use 6d6 Bd to see (in three dice, no less) against a 12.
[21-Aug-2013 03:09:55]  <IllFlower> Kazuto's one stubborn fellow.
[21-Aug-2013 03:10:00]  <IllFlower> Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]: Are you Raising?
[21-Aug-2013 03:10:15]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Yeah, just trying to phrase it.
[21-Aug-2013 03:10:29]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Iverjun, whats' the name of that one cop-restraint move where you basically just chicken-wing the guy's arm?
[21-Aug-2013 03:10:34]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> it's not an armbar, but.
[21-Aug-2013 03:10:36]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> not called*
[21-Aug-2013 03:10:54]  <Iverjun> Um, it's some kind of lock.
[21-Aug-2013 03:11:43]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> You all okay if I go 65?
[21-Aug-2013 03:11:51]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> I mean, he's got the dice.
[21-Aug-2013 03:12:00]  <IllFlower> Actually, I did not realise Barcode[YANO_Hitomi] had rolled three 6s. There's no way for Kazuto to win, so I'm going to have him surrender.
[21-Aug-2013 03:12:11]  <IllFlower> Going to roll for Fallout.

[21-Aug-2013 03:12:42]  <rollermine> (6+1+1)=8
[21-Aug-2013 03:12:46]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> "Don't fuck with conservators d4"
[21-Aug-2013 03:12:48]  <IllFlower> Does anyone care?
[21-Aug-2013 03:13:04]  <Iverjun> I'm good.
[21-Aug-2013 03:13:05]  * Barcode[YANO_Hitomi] checks. d6*
[21-Aug-2013 03:13:13]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> As long as he doesn't suffer short-term death, somehow.
[21-Aug-2013 03:13:41]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((Can I write something quick or are you on that now, IllFlower?)
[21-Aug-2013 03:13:49]  <IllFlower> Go ahead.
[21-Aug-2013 03:14:19]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi sees the scuffle and rushes over, but Kazuto does not seem to make any more attempts to run. At this point he's on the floor within stomping distance of any given one of them, anyway. ((that's all))
[21-Aug-2013 03:14:28]  <ponicalica> my girlfriend's having a breakdown.  fuck.
[21-Aug-2013 03:14:38]  <IllFlower> We can pause.
[21-Aug-2013 03:15:12]  <Iverjun> Okay, while he deals with that I need some help.
[21-Aug-2013 03:15:21]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> hm?
[21-Aug-2013 03:15:21]  <IllFlower> Iverjun: Go ahead and take the effects for that Fallout. Short-term + experience.
[21-Aug-2013 03:15:39]  <Iverjun> I'm picking experience fallout. I'm not sure if I should boost one of my stats or what?
[21-Aug-2013 03:15:52]  <Iverjun> What kind of experience do you think Jun would get out of that short scuffle?
[21-Aug-2013 03:16:38]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Well, it echoes her experience back with knife girl. Maybe she's not as afraid to use force, as long as she's sure she won't seriously hurt anyone? (Though that might harm the character you were aiming for?)
[21-Aug-2013 03:16:45]  <IllFlower> Iverjun: Is the 5d6 Ht before or after your temporary fallout?
[21-Aug-2013 03:16:51]  <Iverjun> Before.
[21-Aug-2013 03:17:08]  <IllFlower> Okay. Noted to clarify.
[21-Aug-2013 03:17:12]  <Iverjun> Thanks.
[21-Aug-2013 03:17:15]  <SpruceZeus> ponicalica: oh nooooo *sends happy vibes in buttercup's direction*
[21-Aug-2013 03:18:13]  <IllFlower> Iverjun: Also, I could see the "my magic is based around protection" trait going down a die to 1d6, considering that she basically solved this with a good dose of offensive violence.
[21-Aug-2013 03:18:24]  <Alicia> (Hugs for Butttercup.)
[21-Aug-2013 03:18:24]  <Iverjun> Yeah, both of those are good options.
[21-Aug-2013 03:18:41]  <Iverjun> I think I'll wind down my magic stuff to 1d6.
[21-Aug-2013 03:18:52]  <Iverjun> Also, while I'm thinking about it, IllFlower.
[21-Aug-2013 03:18:59]  <IllFlower> Hm?
[21-Aug-2013 03:19:02]  <Iverjun> I'd like to assign some relationships to Hitomi and Ayako.
[21-Aug-2013 03:19:05]  <Iverjun> May I?
[21-Aug-2013 03:19:15]  <IllFlower> Sure.
[21-Aug-2013 03:20:53]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> No objections.
[21-Aug-2013 03:21:33]  <ponicalica> okay.  shannon's stabilized I think, and she's talking to her mom.  not sure about continuing
[21-Aug-2013 03:21:46]  <IllFlower> The way Iverjun phrases things, perhaps a reciprocal relationship on Hitomi's part is a good idea.
[21-Aug-2013 03:22:09]  <ponicalica> but I have no objection relationship-wise I think.
[21-Aug-2013 03:22:28]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Okay. I'm going to wind this down to a conclusion soon anyway.
[21-Aug-2013 03:23:03]  <IllFlower> Anyway -
[21-Aug-2013 03:23:10]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> I'm okay with that. A sorta creepy kind of bond but it makes sense in a "we have a better idea of how to work together" context too.
[21-Aug-2013 03:23:57]  <IllFlower> Kazuto rolls over on the stone floor of the underground hall, locking his eyes in an unfocused gaze at Hitomi's face.
[21-Aug-2013 03:24:22]  <IllFlower> "Go ahead. Smash my face in if you want." **
[21-Aug-2013 03:25:41]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((old on.))
[21-Aug-2013 03:27:58]  <IllFlower> It just occurred to me that Kazuto could have used the table as an improvised weapon to go all (ﾉ・∀・)ﾉ　＝＝＝＝＝┻━┻))ﾟДﾟ)･∵. and get a d8 out of the mess, haha. Too late now, though.
[21-Aug-2013 03:28:11]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> I like the throwing face.
[21-Aug-2013 03:28:29]  <ponicalica> nice shift-jis art
[21-Aug-2013 03:28:32]  <IllFlower> He probably still would have lost in any case, unless he got a 7 or 8.
[21-Aug-2013 03:28:43]  <ponicalica> or actually you probably need all of unicode for that don't you
[21-Aug-2013 03:30:06]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi pretends to think for a second, then idly rummages through her bag. "I like that you think of me as some sort of raging bull, but I'm perfectly happy to take my time. I can be more of a...surgeon." She lights a cigarette, mutters an apology to her fellow initiates. "How do you feel about cauterization?"
[21-Aug-2013 03:30:35]  <SpruceZeus> "to go all (ﾉ・∀・)ﾉ　＝＝＝＝＝┻━┻))ﾟДﾟ)･∵." IllFlower really has a way with words
[21-Aug-2013 03:31:49]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((Sorry, in case it wasn't obvious, she's waiting for a response rather than getting to anything nasty.))
[21-Aug-2013 03:31:52]  <IllFlower> "Seeing as how I can't seem to get away from you, I'll talk. You'll just have to avoid killing me first.
[21-Aug-2013 03:31:57]  <IllFlower> "So what do you want to know?" **
[21-Aug-2013 03:32:57]  <Iverjun> "Names of who you're working with. Reasons for taking the books. The whole thing." Jun says, crouching down over Kazuto.
[21-Aug-2013 03:33:04]  <ponicalica> "It's quite simple:  who are you working with, and where are you keeping the books?"
[21-Aug-2013 03:33:10]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi folds her arms and drags, looking down at Kazuto expectantly.
[21-Aug-2013 03:33:27]  <ponicalica> "Oh, and why you took them, that's important too.  Thanks, Jun."
[21-Aug-2013 03:34:21]  <IllFlower> "Right. I'll give you a name." (That is all we had in the stakes, after all.)
[21-Aug-2013 03:35:07]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Accomplices, yes.
[21-Aug-2013 03:35:32]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> though i suppose if we were to be strict about the pluralization thing we'd also have to be strict about the "working together" thing, so never mind.
[21-Aug-2013 03:36:16]  <Alicia> (Hitomi needs to totally go all (ﾉ・∀・)ﾉ　＝＝＝＝＝┻━┻))ﾟДﾟ)･∵ on someone.)
[21-Aug-2013 03:36:38]  <IllFlower> "Kotomi Taniguchi. She's the same year as me" - he looks to be about Jun's age - "and we're under the same familiar.
[21-Aug-2013 03:37:05]  <IllFlower> "It was her idea to steal the books. I just happened to agree it was a good one." **
[21-Aug-2013 03:37:27]  <Iverjun> "It clearly wasn't," Jun snaps.
[21-Aug-2013 03:38:42]  <IllFlower> "You wouldn't say that if you knew why she was doing it. But maybe you ought to hear that from the girl herself." **
[21-Aug-2013 03:39:43]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> "Alright." Hitomi tosses down the cigarette and stomps it flat with more force than necessary. "That's good enough for me."
[21-Aug-2013 03:40:07]  <Iverjun> Jun clenches her hand into a fist again and her knuckles whiten. For a moment she honestly considers smashing the punk's face in, but then she catches herself. "Yeah, fine, let's turn him over and find this girl."
[21-Aug-2013 03:41:39]  <IllFlower> So much violence from the girl who's supposed to be there to take the blows. My word. ;)
[21-Aug-2013 03:42:30]  <Iverjun> I've decided to play a character that's struggling with a violent tendency. I should finish up the backstory I was writing so you can see.
[21-Aug-2013 03:42:34]  <Iverjun> Also: http://www.mydoorsign.com/img/lg/K/No-Smoking-Within-Library-Sign-K-9860.gif

[21-Aug-2013 03:43:12]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Most libraries aren't built on dungeons. (Hitomi'll take the blame.)
[21-Aug-2013 03:44:07]  <IllFlower> Kazuto clambers up to his feet. His face is bloodied, but still recognizable. "Wonderful. I look forward to a less violent relationship between us." **
[21-Aug-2013 03:44:44]  <ponicalica> "Yeah, somehow I think the relationship will mainly be between you and whatever punishment they come up with for you."
[21-Aug-2013 03:45:24]  <IllFlower> "Then so be it." **
[21-Aug-2013 03:45:29]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((I'd like to hope that as creepy as Kyubics are, they wouldn't have anything scary planned out for someone who steals some books, especially without further plans outlined...))
[21-Aug-2013 03:45:57]  <ponicalica> ((stealing forbidden knowledge, Barcode!))
[21-Aug-2013 03:46:13]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((true. i'm just saying, stay tuned for Prison Burst, this fall))
[21-Aug-2013 03:47:15]  <IllFlower> So, what's the plan?
[21-Aug-2013 03:47:21]  <IllFlower> Do you guys have a plan? :p
[21-Aug-2013 03:47:46]  <Iverjun> I believe the plan is to turn him over to the Kyubics and ask about where we can find the rest of his team.
[21-Aug-2013 03:48:41]  <IllFlower> Okay, any objections to eliding the first part and picking up with the second next session?
[21-Aug-2013 03:48:50]  <Iverjun> No objects.
[21-Aug-2013 03:48:54]  <ponicalica> no objections
[21-Aug-2013 03:49:01]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Sure thing.
[21-Aug-2013 03:49:09]  <Iverjun> Good session, I think.
[21-Aug-2013 03:49:17]  <IllFlower> Okay, then, we'll close here for tonight. Thanks for playing, everybody.
