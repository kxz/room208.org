[12-Jul-2014 20:00:21]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: "You're the em now, dogs!"
[12-Jul-2014 20:00:59]  <IllFlower> Okay, anything before we begin?
[12-Jul-2014 20:01:58]  <ponicalica> not from here
[12-Jul-2014 20:02:37]  <BGTB2005> can't think of anything here
[12-Jul-2014 20:02:54]  <IllFlower> Then let us be off.
[12-Jul-2014 20:02:55]  <Rig> noe
[12-Jul-2014 20:03:49]  <IllFlower> It's hot. Incredibly hot. The simmering haze of Kikugawa's asphalt jungle is rather like an oven.
[12-Jul-2014 20:05:04]  <IllFlower> Shii has opened the window and set fans in the four corners of her office to full blast -- how she's managed to do that without opposable thumbs is a mystery for another day -- but regardless it's barely helping.
[12-Jul-2014 20:06:02]  <IllFlower> The Conservators shift around uncomfortably, trying to keep their clothes from sticking too thoroughly to their skin.
[12-Jul-2014 20:06:21]  <IllFlower> Shii paces around on top of her desk, as she usually does when delivering the news.
[12-Jul-2014 20:06:42]  <IllFlower> "It's been a long day," she says. "Lots of developments."
[12-Jul-2014 20:07:06]  <IllFlower> She shakes her head in fatigue.
[12-Jul-2014 20:08:02]  <IllFlower> "An initiate was knocked comatose in a witch attack over in the next city. Miyahama.
[12-Jul-2014 20:09:07]  <IllFlower> "You might be wondering why this is any of your business, since they have Conservators over there, too. Well..." Shii looks directly at Ayako. "We've had a report of a familiar face popping up again."
[12-Jul-2014 20:09:17]  <IllFlower> **
[12-Jul-2014 20:09:37]  <ponicalica> "Hm?"
[12-Jul-2014 20:09:43]  <Rig> Is Kazuki attending this meeting?
[12-Jul-2014 20:09:48]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[12-Jul-2014 20:10:16]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Someone only she would recognize out of this group, now that everyone else who would is either retired or dead. Hint.
[12-Jul-2014 20:11:10]  <ponicalica> Ayako suddenly remebers.  "Is it one of Kotomi's cult?"
[12-Jul-2014 20:11:38]  <IllFlower> "Not just 'one of,'" Shii says.
[12-Jul-2014 20:12:09]  <IllFlower> "The leader herself."
[12-Jul-2014 20:13:04]  <Rig> Kazuki stands quietly in the back of the group. He recognizes the name Kotomi, but only vaguely. His father must have mentioned it.
[12-Jul-2014 20:13:06]  <ponicalica> Ayako shudders as she thinks back to the gym building ablaze
[12-Jul-2014 20:13:49]  <IllFlower> "How much do the rest of you know about Kotomi Taniguchi?" Shii asks the remaining three.
[12-Jul-2014 20:14:41]  <Alicia> Hikari turns to Ayako, surprised, before looking back at Shii. "I've never heard of the name before... and just what was this cult for?"
[12-Jul-2014 20:14:45]  <Rig> Kazuki stays quiet. He wants to see what the others know before he speaks up.
[12-Jul-2014 20:15:00]  <IllFlower> ("It's like... I've fought her in a past life...")
[12-Jul-2014 20:16:39]  <BGTB2005> ((gears are whirring))
[12-Jul-2014 20:16:52]  <ponicalica> "They stole books from the Library here.  We only really were able to get a vague idea of what they were trying to do with them; they basically scattered after our...confrontation..." Ayako begins to tear up.
[12-Jul-2014 20:17:19]  <ponicalica> (yeah, whoever said anything about shipping, I'm feeding right into their hands right now I think :p)
[12-Jul-2014 20:17:24]  <IllFlower> Shii steps in. "It's all right, Ayako. I'll explain."
[12-Jul-2014 20:17:36]  <IllFlower> She begins pacing again.
[12-Jul-2014 20:18:19]  <IllFlower> "The implication was that they wanted to learn how to independently grant magical abilities. Conduct their own initiations, that sort of thing.
[12-Jul-2014 20:18:34]  <IllFlower> "We're not quite sure of their motivations, but you can see why this would be dangerous."
[12-Jul-2014 20:20:35]  <IllFlower> Shii points to a map on the desk. "There's also been an increase in witch activity in Miyahama over the past few weeks. I suspect this isn't an unrelated phenomenon."

[12-Jul-2014 20:21:06]  <Rig> Kazuki speaks up, “Why weren’t they run down after they were exposed the first time?"
[12-Jul-2014 20:21:31]  <IllFlower> Shii freezes. She fires a glance over at Ayako.
[12-Jul-2014 20:23:17]  <IllFlower> "Most of her followers have been apprehended," she begins, carefully choosing her words. "Miss Taniguchi herself overpowered the team sent to capture her, though, and she hasn't been seen since. Until now, at least, if this report is to be believed."
[12-Jul-2014 20:23:18]  *** SF_Sorrow <SF_Sorrow@eduroam-241-61.ucsc.edu> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 186 seconds)
[12-Jul-2014 20:24:54]  <IllFlower> Shii pauses. "I won't go into too much detail. Suffice it to say it's still a sensitive subject for us."
[12-Jul-2014 20:25:56]  <Rig> Kazuki nods.
[12-Jul-2014 20:27:32]  <IllFlower> "Anyway, the initiate who's been rendered unconscious had a partner on the same assignment. If we're going to investigate what's going on, we could do worse than by starting with him.
[12-Jul-2014 20:29:00]  <IllFlower> "The victim's name is Megumi Arita. She's in convalescence at St. Joseph's. Her partner is Yuuya Kinomoto. I've asked their familiar to bring him for a meeting at the hospital."
[12-Jul-2014 20:29:20]  <IllFlower> The name Kinomoto is vaguely familiar to Kazuki, much like the name Kotomi was, but he can't quite place it.
[12-Jul-2014 20:30:25]  <IllFlower> "Are there any questions?"
[12-Jul-2014 20:31:20]  <Rig> “May I ask why I was assigned to this team so suddenly?” Kazuki asks.
[12-Jul-2014 20:32:19]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.72.63.0> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[12-Jul-2014 20:32:36]  <IllFlower> "That's above my pay grade," Shii says in an ambiguously sarcastic tone.
[12-Jul-2014 20:32:50]  <ponicalica> ("This is the rejects pile, and everyone thinks you're just a soft political appointment.")
[12-Jul-2014 20:33:43]  <Rig> (How can you be ambiguously sarcastic)
[12-Jul-2014 20:33:51]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.72.63.0> has joined #madokamadness
[12-Jul-2014 20:34:02]  <IllFlower> You can't really tell if she's being sarcastic or not.

[12-Jul-2014 20:35:56]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at the other conservators and lets the question drop.
[12-Jul-2014 20:37:08]  <IllFlower> Anything else?
[12-Jul-2014 20:37:40]  <Rig> I think I’m good.
[12-Jul-2014 20:37:54]  <ponicalica> Same here
[12-Jul-2014 20:37:58]  <ponicalica> Alicia, BGTB2005?
[12-Jul-2014 20:38:17]  <BGTB2005> nothing comes to mind
[12-Jul-2014 20:38:20]  <Alicia> Good...
[12-Jul-2014 20:39:05]  <IllFlower> "Well, if there's nothing else, we're adjourned. I've sent word to Mr. Kinomoto and Masakichi. They'll be meeting you in the hospital lobby."
[12-Jul-2014 20:39:54]  <ponicalica> wait who's masakichi
[12-Jul-2014 20:40:01]  <BGTB2005> familiar?
[12-Jul-2014 20:40:21]  <IllFlower> Mm-hmm.
[12-Jul-2014 20:40:33]  <ponicalica> thought that might be it but wasn't sure >_>
[12-Jul-2014 20:41:21]  <IllFlower> The train to Miyahama is, thankfully, air-conditioned, and about 45 minutes later the Conservators step through the main doors of St. Joseph's.
[12-Jul-2014 20:42:03]  <Rig> A very conspicuous crowd of various aged students walk into a hospital.
[12-Jul-2014 20:42:16]  <IllFlower> C'est la vie.
[12-Jul-2014 20:42:45]  <ponicalica> At least they're not in Conservator uniform?
[12-Jul-2014 20:42:55]  <IllFlower> If they haven't noticed the teenager talking to nobody for the past little while, I suspect the crowd's already beyond hope, though.
[12-Jul-2014 20:43:06]  <Rig> Kazuki is always wearing his homemade Prophet robes.
[12-Jul-2014 20:43:14]  <ponicalica> And the cat ears?
[12-Jul-2014 20:43:18]  <Rig> Hush
[12-Jul-2014 20:43:24]  <IllFlower> lol.
[12-Jul-2014 20:43:25]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[12-Jul-2014 20:43:41]  <Alicia> So, yes.

[12-Jul-2014 20:45:00]  <IllFlower> The boy, a tall fellow with jet-black hair, rises up to meet the group. He wears a faint smile of recognition on his face. Next to him is a small bear-like creature, presumably Masakichi.
[12-Jul-2014 20:45:28]  <ponicalica> plot twist: the familiar is Monobear, upupupupup
[12-Jul-2014 20:45:56]  <Rig> Would Kazuki recognize this boy?
[12-Jul-2014 20:46:06]  <IllFlower> "Sakura," Yuuya says, chuckling. "Didn't think I'd see you here." He extends a hand in greeting.
[12-Jul-2014 20:46:14]  <ponicalica> "Do you know him?"
[12-Jul-2014 20:47:18]  <Rig> “Kinomoto,” Kazuki smiles back as he takes the boy’s hand. “What are you doing in Miyahama? I thought your father was reassigned farther north.”
[12-Jul-2014 20:47:46]  <ponicalica> Do the other conservators know Rig's dad's a prophet?
[12-Jul-2014 20:48:04]  <IllFlower> Rig's dad? REAL LIFE PROPHET??
[12-Jul-2014 20:48:10]  <Rig> Heh.
[12-Jul-2014 20:48:10]  <ponicalica> er, Kazuki's dad
[12-Jul-2014 20:48:20]  <IllFlower> That's up to Rig, presumably.
[12-Jul-2014 20:48:24]  <Rig> Nah.
[12-Jul-2014 20:48:32]  <Rig> IllFlower: I’d like to assign some dice to this relationship though.

[12-Jul-2014 20:48:51]  <IllFlower> You've got 3d6. Go right ahead.
[12-Jul-2014 20:48:52]  <Rig> Just a 1d6 for Kinomoto being an old childhood friend.
[12-Jul-2014 20:49:19]  <IllFlower> Cool.
[12-Jul-2014 20:49:49]  <Rig> “Kinomoto is an old friend of mine,” Kazuki says in a quick aside to Ayako.
[12-Jul-2014 20:49:55]  <IllFlower> Yuuya demurs. His only explanation is "Circumstances."
[12-Jul-2014 20:50:30]  <Rig> “I can relate,” he says with a pointed glance at his compatriots.
[12-Jul-2014 20:51:10]  <ponicalica> arc 4: Kazuki Sakura Thinks His Fellow Conservators Are Lunatics
[12-Jul-2014 20:51:29]  <IllFlower> They're not? ;)
[12-Jul-2014 20:51:36]  <ponicalica> I never said he was wrong to think that.
[12-Jul-2014 20:51:40]  <Rig> One Flew Over the Convservatory
[12-Jul-2014 20:52:08]  <BGTB2005> one of them literally could
[12-Jul-2014 20:52:56]  <IllFlower> "They're working me rather hard," Yuuya says, ignoring Kazuki's tension. "I suspect Mukai wants to test me as much as she can before she consents to my promotion."
[12-Jul-2014 20:53:31]  <ponicalica> that was Yurika's last name, right?
[12-Jul-2014 20:53:48]  <IllFlower> ;)
[12-Jul-2014 20:54:49]  <ponicalica> Rig: Did you put a name in there in Japanese name order?
[12-Jul-2014 20:54:57]  <Rig> Probably.
[12-Jul-2014 20:55:09]  <IllFlower> Time to break out the paddles.
[12-Jul-2014 20:55:23]  * Alicia brings them out.
[12-Jul-2014 20:55:32]  <BGTB2005> of course you'd have some
[12-Jul-2014 20:55:37]  <Alicia> Oh hush.
[12-Jul-2014 20:55:37]  <IllFlower> lol.
[12-Jul-2014 20:56:41]  <Rig> “As nice as it is to see you, we are here for business,” Kazuki says.
[12-Jul-2014 20:57:09]  <Rig> “Your partner was involved in the recent attacks that we’ve been sent to investigate.”
[12-Jul-2014 20:57:16]  <IllFlower> "I take it the other three are here for that business, then?
[12-Jul-2014 20:57:41]  <IllFlower> "I figured as much. Last I checked, you weren't into younger girls." Yuuya smirks.
[12-Jul-2014 20:58:01]  <Rig> Kazuki blushes.
[12-Jul-2014 20:58:06]  <BGTB2005> pffff
[12-Jul-2014 20:58:19]  <ponicalica> Pretty sure Rin's into his cat ears though
[12-Jul-2014 20:58:33]  <BGTB2005> possible
[12-Jul-2014 20:59:14]  <IllFlower> "Anyway," Yuuya continues, adopting a more serious tone, "Megumi's condition is stable, last I heard. With any luck, she'll be back on her feet in a few days, or so the doctors say.
[12-Jul-2014 20:59:37]  <IllFlower> "I don't know if I'd want to put her back on the job right then, though.
[12-Jul-2014 21:00:00]  <IllFlower> "Things have been getting stormy out there." His eyes seem to cloud over.
[12-Jul-2014 21:01:07]  <Rig> “Could you tell us what happened?"
[12-Jul-2014 21:02:03]  <IllFlower> "The witch was more powerful than we expected. Binding magic. Megumi was nearly strangled."
[12-Jul-2014 21:03:17]  <Rig> “Was anyone else injured? Was the witch stopped?”
[12-Jul-2014 21:04:24]  <IllFlower> "I managed to get the situation under control before anyone else was hurt, fortunately," Yuuya says. "I did take a couple of burns, but nothing serious."
[12-Jul-2014 21:04:38]  <IllFlower> Yuuya lifts his left sleeve to reveal deep red marks on his arm.
[12-Jul-2014 21:05:13]  <ponicalica> "The witch also used fire?"
[12-Jul-2014 21:05:31]  <IllFlower> Rope burns, presumably.
[12-Jul-2014 21:05:56]  <ponicalica> in which Ayako jumps the Kotomi gun
[12-Jul-2014 21:06:08]  <IllFlower> (Everyone's eyes find their way to Hikari. "What? What did I do?")
[12-Jul-2014 21:06:17]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[12-Jul-2014 21:06:58]  <ponicalica> Hikari was part of Kotomi's cult all along.  So was Rin.  Ayako ended up with a really bad choice of partners.
[12-Jul-2014 21:07:02]  <IllFlower> Nobody's going to ask about Kotommi?
[12-Jul-2014 21:07:03]  <Alicia> ("Why I would never! How rude of you.")
[12-Jul-2014 21:07:37]  <ponicalica> "Have you seen a Kotomi Taniguchi around?"
[12-Jul-2014 21:07:37]  <Rig> Kazuki nods, “Good job handling that by yourself. We heard rumors of a cult leader showing their face in town. Was she involved in this?”
[12-Jul-2014 21:07:50]  <ponicalica> yeah scratch what I said and just let Kazuki continue the conversation
[12-Jul-2014 21:07:50]  <ponicalica> lol
[12-Jul-2014 21:07:56]  <IllFlower> "A who?
[12-Jul-2014 21:07:56]  <Rig> Nah, it works.
[12-Jul-2014 21:08:11]  <Rig> That way Ayako can just keep jumping the gun to stop Kotomi.
[12-Jul-2014 21:08:24]  <IllFlower> "Oh, Kotomi?
[12-Jul-2014 21:08:42]  <IllFlower> "That rumor has been going around, yes..."
[12-Jul-2014 21:08:57]  <IllFlower> Yuuya smiles nervously.
[12-Jul-2014 21:09:24]  <IllFlower> "I haven't directly seen any evidence of her myself, but then again I was only here for this one assignment.
[12-Jul-2014 21:10:03]  <Rig> “Are you planning on leaving soon?”
[12-Jul-2014 21:10:12]  <IllFlower> "I wouldn't be too surprised if she were behind this somehow, though."
[12-Jul-2014 21:10:25]  <IllFlower> Yuuya tips his head in puzzlement. "Why do you ask?"
[12-Jul-2014 21:11:03]  <BGTB2005> Rin turns to Ayako. "You've encountered her before, right? What was her skill set?"
[12-Jul-2014 21:11:28]  <IllFlower> ("A bit like yours. Actually, come to think of it... *stares*")
[12-Jul-2014 21:11:48]  <Rig> “I was hoping we’d have time to catch up,” Kazuki says.
[12-Jul-2014 21:11:59]  <Alicia> In which Kazuki leaves the girls hanging.
[12-Jul-2014 21:13:07]  <IllFlower> Masakichi cuts in for the first time. "Yuuya has other responsibilities to attend to. We're only going to be here until a sentry can come by to relieve him."
[12-Jul-2014 21:13:52]  <ponicalica> Ayako turns to Rin, and transforms long enough to show the continued damage to her costume in the sleeves.  "Fire mage, primarily."
[12-Jul-2014 21:14:55]  <IllFlower> "It's as he says," Yuuya confirms. "Confirmation is a long, difficult road."
[12-Jul-2014 21:15:51]  <IllFlower> Pretend I didn't just use two different forms of the word "confirm" right next to each other there.
[12-Jul-2014 21:16:04]  *** Section42L <~Section@CPE18593345ef4c-CM18593345ef49.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[12-Jul-2014 21:16:34]  <Rig> Kazuki starts to grimace, but catches himself. “Well, I wish you luck. I think we’re going to go see how Megumi is.”
[12-Jul-2014 21:17:25]  <IllFlower> "Of course," Yuuya says. "Best of luck to you as well."
[12-Jul-2014 21:18:43]  <Rig> “Shall we?” Kazuki asks. Despite being the newest member of this group he’s certainly taken charge.
[12-Jul-2014 21:19:11]  <IllFlower> The Conservators do a HATERS GONNA HATE dance all the way up to Megumi's room.
[12-Jul-2014 21:19:29]  <Rig> Can you give us an example of this dance?
[12-Jul-2014 21:19:32]  <IllFlower> Because nobody else is really paying attention to them.

[12-Jul-2014 21:20:23]  <Rig> Hm.
[12-Jul-2014 21:20:39]  <Alicia> Hikari's a tad irritated, but smiles and goes along. "Of course. Take us there, please, Kazuki."
[12-Jul-2014 21:21:09]  <Alicia> (Was tempted to say Sakura, but naaaaaaah.)
[12-Jul-2014 21:24:47]  <IllFlower> Megumi's room is otherwise empty when the Conservators enter.
[12-Jul-2014 21:25:13]  <IllFlower> True to Yuuya's word, there are signs that Megumi's been nearly strangled.
[12-Jul-2014 21:25:58]  <IllFlower> Dark, bruised rings run around her neck and legs. The rest is concealed underneath her gown.
[12-Jul-2014 21:26:32]  <ponicalica> "I think the witch attack may be more linked to Kotomi than your friend realizes; the rope marks look suspiciously similar to Kotomi's cult's..."
[12-Jul-2014 21:28:23]  <IllFlower> On Megumi's face is a respirator mask, which clouds in time with her labored breathing.
[12-Jul-2014 21:28:45]  <Rig> “Ayako, could you transform again?”
[12-Jul-2014 21:29:12]  <ponicalica> "Mmhmm.  What're you planning; tracing magic?"
[12-Jul-2014 21:29:33]  <Rig> “Something similar, yes."
[12-Jul-2014 21:31:35]  <IllFlower> How similar?
[12-Jul-2014 21:32:00]  <Rig> Well, I wanted to use his magic sense to compare the damage to Ayako’s costume to the wounds on Megumi.
[12-Jul-2014 21:32:45]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[12-Jul-2014 21:32:50]  <IllFlower> Okay.
[12-Jul-2014 21:34:26]  <IllFlower> With Kazuki's incantation, a shower of small sparkles, looking like fairy dust, bursts into the air from Ayako's costume. He repeats the same incantation, creating another white cloud from Megumi's bruises.
[12-Jul-2014 21:34:57]  <Rig> I was typing something up, but that’ll work.
[12-Jul-2014 21:35:21]  <IllFlower> The cloud over Ayako begins to slowly turn a deep red-orange. A fitting color for Kotomi, no doubt.
[12-Jul-2014 21:35:57]  <IllFlower> Kazuki continues chanting, drawing the color out from Megumi's cloud as well.
[12-Jul-2014 21:36:46]  <Rig> “I’d say you’re right. She’s definitely involved.”
[12-Jul-2014 21:37:00]  <IllFlower> A few wisps of orange emerge there as well, but much to Kazuki's surprise, it's quickly overwhelmed by a dark purple color and tinges of green.
[12-Jul-2014 21:37:10]  <Rig> Strike that then.
[12-Jul-2014 21:37:50]  <IllFlower> It's never that simple.
[12-Jul-2014 21:38:08]  <Rig> Not with you.
[12-Jul-2014 21:38:16]  <Alicia> ("I thought you were supposed to be good at this sort of thing, Kazuki.")
[12-Jul-2014 21:38:33]  <Rig> “Kotomi might be involved, but she’s not calling all the shots here.”
[12-Jul-2014 21:40:25]  <Rig> Kazuki pauses and looks at the injured girl. It’s not the first time he’s seen such pain, but they seem to get younger each time.
[12-Jul-2014 21:40:34]  <Rig> “Any ideas where we should go from here?"
[12-Jul-2014 21:42:14]  <IllFlower> I've got stuff.
[12-Jul-2014 21:42:42]  <Rig> Well, of course you do.
[12-Jul-2014 21:43:03]  <IllFlower> :D
[12-Jul-2014 21:43:22]  <IllFlower> Anybody?
[12-Jul-2014 21:43:40]  <ponicalica> Not really.
[12-Jul-2014 21:43:42]  <IllFlower> Bueller?
[12-Jul-2014 21:43:42]  <Alicia> (I got nothing. >_>;)
[12-Jul-2014 21:43:58]  <BGTB2005> "Do you think we could get any information from where the attack occurred?"
[12-Jul-2014 21:45:36]  <IllFlower> You probably could, but you'd have to know what to look for first.
[12-Jul-2014 21:45:36]  <ponicalica> "Possibly.  Witches' trails can be...fickle."
[12-Jul-2014 21:45:57]  <Rig> We’re looking for a bondage cult.
[12-Jul-2014 21:46:19]  <Alicia> (Snerk.)
[12-Jul-2014 21:46:44]  <IllFlower> Well, unless you manage to locate their stash of ropes and chains, you'll need a bit more information.
[12-Jul-2014 21:46:54]  <IllFlower> Let's move on, anyway.
[12-Jul-2014 21:48:30]  <IllFlower> Rin slides open the door to leave, but instead finds herself face-to-face with a boy on the other side.
[12-Jul-2014 21:49:05]  <IllFlower> Both of them jump back in mild shock.
[12-Jul-2014 21:50:00]  <IllFlower> The boy scratches his head awkwardly. "I didn't think anyone would be here," he says.
[12-Jul-2014 21:50:16]  <Rig> Wouldn’t Rin’s response be to set him on fire?
[12-Jul-2014 21:50:28]  <IllFlower> He looks just as out of place here as the Conservators, which of course means that he's also one.
[12-Jul-2014 21:50:29]  <BGTB2005> She'd probably prepare to punch him
[12-Jul-2014 21:51:00]  <ponicalica> Only if he's a bully.
[12-Jul-2014 21:51:01]  <IllFlower> "I'm the watch," the boy explains. "You must be the ones who were talking to Kinomoto earlier..."
[12-Jul-2014 21:54:32]  <ponicalica> Ayako nods.  "Do you know anything about the situation yet, in particular, Kotomi Taniguchi?"
[12-Jul-2014 21:55:24]  <IllFlower> "I'm fresh out of the frying pan and into the fire," the boy says with a shrug.
[12-Jul-2014 21:56:09]  <IllFlower> "There's been an increase in witch attacks back home, too. Started about a week before this one.
[12-Jul-2014 21:56:48]  <IllFlower> "First I've ever heard of any of this having to do with Kotomi Taniguchi, though."
[12-Jul-2014 21:57:52]  <Rig> “Have you noticed anything in common with the attacks?”
[12-Jul-2014 21:59:00]  <IllFlower> "Yeah. All seem to have something to do with binding somehow."
[12-Jul-2014 21:59:53]  <BGTB2005> (Everyone stares at Hikari)
[12-Jul-2014 21:59:56]  <IllFlower> The boy tilts his head back. "I guess that's why Kinomoto and I got sent here. We have experience with this sort of thing. Unfortunately."
[12-Jul-2014 22:00:06]  <Rig> “Experience?"
[12-Jul-2014 22:00:28]  <Rig> (“I had a BDSM phase")
[12-Jul-2014 22:00:44]  <ponicalica> (Hikari's ears perk up.)
[12-Jul-2014 22:01:00]  <IllFlower> "From the attacks back home."
[12-Jul-2014 22:01:45]  *** CentralAve <~CentralAv@d60-65-209-130.col.wideopenwest.com> has joined #madokamadness
[12-Jul-2014 22:02:13]  <Alicia> (Pfft.)
[12-Jul-2014 22:02:16]  <Rig> “When did you transfer here?”
[12-Jul-2014 22:02:34]  <IllFlower> Oh, I didn't mean to imply he was transferred, just assigned.
[12-Jul-2014 22:02:44]  <IllFlower> He's here on loan, so to speak.
[12-Jul-2014 22:03:13]  <Rig> Ah, I see.
[12-Jul-2014 22:03:28]  <IllFlower> Kind of like Yuuya's "circumstances."
[12-Jul-2014 22:03:32]  <Rig> Hm.
[12-Jul-2014 22:03:44]  <Rig> Do we know when these attacks started happening?
[12-Jul-2014 22:04:29]  <IllFlower> Maybe about a month ago here. A week or two earlier in wherever the boy and Yuuya are from.
[12-Jul-2014 22:05:26]  <ponicalica> "Do you know anything as to what caused the attacks back home?"
[12-Jul-2014 22:07:26]  <IllFlower> "I probably wouldn't be here if we did. Something about this whole thing's seemed off from the start.
[12-Jul-2014 22:07:43]  <IllFlower> "You mentioned Kotomi Taniguchi, right?" the boy asks Ayako.
[12-Jul-2014 22:08:07]  <ponicalica> Ayako nods again.
[12-Jul-2014 22:08:58]  <IllFlower> The boy ponders for a second, his face contorting in confusion.
[12-Jul-2014 22:09:32]  <IllFlower> "Is she a suspect?"
[12-Jul-2014 22:11:57]  <Rig> “She’s a fugitive cult leader, but we don’t know how she’s related to this.”
[12-Jul-2014 22:12:46]  <IllFlower> The boy nods.
[12-Jul-2014 22:13:14]  <Rig> Kazuki eyes the boy. “Do you know something?”
[12-Jul-2014 22:13:47]  <IllFlower> "Just thinking.
[12-Jul-2014 22:14:55]  <IllFlower> "Hm..."
[12-Jul-2014 22:15:07]  <IllFlower> Suddenly, a light goes on in the boy's eyes.
[12-Jul-2014 22:15:48]  <IllFlower> "That's it, that's right. I think Kinomoto and Taniguchi used to know each other."
[12-Jul-2014 22:16:19]  <IllFlower> He snaps his fingers. "That's what was bothering me when you mentioned her."
[12-Jul-2014 22:16:24]  <ponicalica> ("Know each other?  Like, biblically?")
[12-Jul-2014 22:16:36]  <IllFlower> ...
[12-Jul-2014 22:16:40]  <Alicia> (lol)
[12-Jul-2014 22:17:11]  <Rig> “Used to?” Kazuki asks.
[12-Jul-2014 22:17:15]  <Rig> “How long ago?"
[12-Jul-2014 22:17:36]  <IllFlower> "It's been at least a year," the boy says.
[12-Jul-2014 22:18:15]  <ponicalica> "Did they have a falling out?"
[12-Jul-2014 22:18:59]  <IllFlower> "Dunno. I imagine they stopped talking so much when Taniguchi started going underground.
[12-Jul-2014 22:19:59]  <IllFlower> "Kinomoto does seem to get involved with some odd characters sometimes.
[12-Jul-2014 22:20:25]  <ponicalica> Ayako looks at Kazuki, hoping to get some more information on the odd character remark.
[12-Jul-2014 22:20:54]  <Rig> Kazuki ignores the look.
[12-Jul-2014 22:21:18]  <IllFlower> "Well, it's not really my business what he does. Seems like the Prophets trust him well enough."
[12-Jul-2014 22:21:32]  <IllFlower> Rig: lol
[12-Jul-2014 22:21:51]  <Rig> “Some prophets.”
[12-Jul-2014 22:22:08]  <Rig> “We should see if we can catch up with Kinomoto before he leaves town.”
[12-Jul-2014 22:22:34]  <IllFlower> What'd you want to do?
[12-Jul-2014 22:23:02]  <Rig> Try to find Kinomoto and ask him why he didn’t mention he knew Kotomi.
[12-Jul-2014 22:23:13]  <Rig> Assuming that’s fine with the rest of the group.
[12-Jul-2014 22:23:28]  <IllFlower> He might still be downstairs if you hurry.
[12-Jul-2014 22:23:51]  <IllFlower> Get Rin to punch a hole in the floor.
[12-Jul-2014 22:23:52]  <Alicia> Yeah, meeting up sounds like a good plan.
[12-Jul-2014 22:24:28]  <Rig> “Thank you for the information,” Kazuki tells the boy as he brushes by him and makes for the elevator.
[12-Jul-2014 22:24:48]  <IllFlower> Brusque.
[12-Jul-2014 22:24:52]  <BGTB2005> exploding the floor might be faster
[12-Jul-2014 22:25:04]  <Rig> Not exactly gonna help Megumi’s health though.
[12-Jul-2014 22:25:13]  <BGTB2005> yeah

[12-Jul-2014 22:26:02]  <IllFlower> Kazuki doesn't even bother waiting for the girls to catch up. Ayako manages to make it into the elevator before the doors close, but Rin and Hikari are forced to take the stairs.
[12-Jul-2014 22:26:03]  <BGTB2005> Could Megumi be Rin's old friend?
[12-Jul-2014 22:26:28]  <IllFlower> Would certainly be a surprise if she were.
[12-Jul-2014 22:27:07]  <IllFlower> Yuuya is just making to leave as Kazuki reaches the lobby. It looks like Masakichi's been summoned elsewhere already, as he's no longer present.
[12-Jul-2014 22:27:32]  <Rig> “Kinomoto, hold up!” Kazuki calls out.
[12-Jul-2014 22:28:24]  <IllFlower> Yuuya turns around. He seems a bit surprised to see Kazuki.
[12-Jul-2014 22:28:38]  <IllFlower> "Sakura? Something wrong?"
[12-Jul-2014 22:29:07]  <Rig> Kazuki catches up to his friend. “You didn’t mention that you knew Kotomi.”
[12-Jul-2014 22:30:12]  <IllFlower> Yuuya shrugs. "Yeah. A while ago. She was kinda popular before she went crazy."
[12-Jul-2014 22:30:44]  <Rig> “Was there a reason you didn’t tell me?”
[12-Jul-2014 22:31:08]  <IllFlower> "Didn't think it was important."
[12-Jul-2014 22:32:28]  <Rig> “It might be. These binding witches seem to be following you. And with Kotomi around maybe they’re all related."
[12-Jul-2014 22:32:58]  <IllFlower> Yuuya's eyes go wide for a moment.
[12-Jul-2014 22:33:15]  <IllFlower> "You think she's targeting me?"
[12-Jul-2014 22:34:34]  <Rig> “I don’t think targetting is exactly right, but with your confirmation approaching you are a priority right now.” Kazuki pauses and looks to see if any of the girls kept up with him.
[12-Jul-2014 22:34:49]  <Rig> “Maybe we should stick with you?"
[12-Jul-2014 22:34:52]  <IllFlower> Ayako's there.
[12-Jul-2014 22:35:01]  <IllFlower> Rin and Hikari? Depends on how fast they ran.
[12-Jul-2014 22:35:36]  <Rig> They got distracted gossiping about their new partner.
[12-Jul-2014 22:35:49]  <BGTB2005> probably
[12-Jul-2014 22:36:19]  <IllFlower> ("Don't you think he's just so *dreamy*?" "Nah. Handcuffs don't suit him.")
[12-Jul-2014 22:36:31]  <BGTB2005> pffff
[12-Jul-2014 22:36:55]  <Alicia> (Pfffft.)
[12-Jul-2014 22:36:56]  <IllFlower> Yuuya is taken aback by Kazuki's suggestion. "Stick with me?"
[12-Jul-2014 22:37:35]  <Rig> “I know its been a long time since we were close. And this isn’t an attempt to… go back to the way things were. I’m just doing my job.”
[12-Jul-2014 22:37:56]  <Rig> Kazuki’s expression hardens. “And right now it seems like you’re a lead in this case.”
[12-Jul-2014 22:38:08]  <IllFlower> "I -- uh..." Yuuya briefly seems lost for words.
[12-Jul-2014 22:39:15]  <IllFlower> Finally, he shakes his head. "No. I appreciate it, but there are a lot of confidential rituals I have to participate in. You might be able to talk to Mukai to get something arranged, but you won't be able to keep to me directly."
[12-Jul-2014 22:39:55]  <IllFlower> Yuuya's head continues to move long after he's finished talking.
[12-Jul-2014 22:40:27]  <Rig> Kazuki knows that even Conservators are unlikely to get clearance into those rituals.
[12-Jul-2014 22:40:59]  <IllFlower> Well, still, the guy's strangely jittery.
[12-Jul-2014 22:41:31]  <Rig> True, but I don’t think Kazuki is likely to press him, but Ayako is.
[12-Jul-2014 22:41:36]  <IllFlower> Maybe it's just stress from being a potential future victim.
[12-Jul-2014 22:41:54]  <Rig> After all Ayako still has a bone to pick with Kotomi.
[12-Jul-2014 22:42:09]  <IllFlower> Or: "SAKURA ARE YOU BULLYING THE POOR BOY *punch*"
[12-Jul-2014 22:42:47]  <ponicalica> "Even without breaching the rituals, there should be some way for us to set up a perimeter.  Keep Kotomi out and such."
[12-Jul-2014 22:43:23]  <Rig> “I’m sure the proctors will have their own perimeters.”
[12-Jul-2014 22:43:46]  <IllFlower> "It can't hurt to have more security, though," Yuuya says.
[12-Jul-2014 22:45:24]  <Rig> “Perhaps. Are you heading to meet with Mukai now?”
[12-Jul-2014 22:45:44]  <IllFlower> "Yeah. I can't stay in Miyahama for too long."
[12-Jul-2014 22:46:38]  <Rig> I’m not sure if it’s worth our time to stick in Miyahama or follow him.
[12-Jul-2014 22:46:42]  <Rig> What do you guys think?
[12-Jul-2014 22:47:00]  <Alicia> I say follow.
[12-Jul-2014 22:47:10]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005 did suggest checking out the crime scene, for what it's worth.
[12-Jul-2014 22:47:14]  *** SoakedSeraph <~Spheraph@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[12-Jul-2014 22:47:20]  <IllFlower> So that is an option.
[12-Jul-2014 22:47:31]  <Rig> I assume that’s what we’d do if we stayed.
[12-Jul-2014 22:47:49]  <BGTB2005> How practical would splitting the group be?
[12-Jul-2014 22:47:53]  <Rig> How about we check out the crime scene and call Shii to see if he can get us a meeting with Mukai.
[12-Jul-2014 22:48:00]  <Rig> No splitting.
[12-Jul-2014 22:48:05]  <Rig> That’s never a good option.
[12-Jul-2014 22:48:07]  <IllFlower> Yeah, last time we split the group someone died.
[12-Jul-2014 22:48:24]  <Rig> It also slows the game down.
[12-Jul-2014 22:48:30]  <IllFlower> Shii's a she. You know, like her name's pronounced.
[12-Jul-2014 22:49:01]  <IllFlower> Shii, she "Shii" Shii by the seashore.
[12-Jul-2014 22:49:14]  <Rig> Right.
[12-Jul-2014 22:49:18]  <IllFlower> Rig: The death argument's always more compelling, though.
[12-Jul-2014 22:49:26]  <ponicalica> Not for Rig.
[12-Jul-2014 22:49:30]  <Rig> Hahaha
[12-Jul-2014 22:49:52]  <IllFlower> "You mean I have to wait *longer* to go out in a blaze of glory? YOU FUCKER"
[12-Jul-2014 22:50:09]  <Alicia> Yeah, actually, I'm for checking the crime scene.
[12-Jul-2014 22:50:43]  <BGTB2005> Though it's pretty much shot down, I was thinking a security detail following Yuuya and essentially magical CSI investigating
[12-Jul-2014 22:51:06]  <BGTB2005> but yeah, sticking with checking the crime scene
[12-Jul-2014 22:52:02]  <Alicia> Only Ayako and Kazuki can really do the magical CSI, though.
[12-Jul-2014 22:52:35]  <ponicalica> might need Rin and Hikari to help defend against the spirits that'll emerge when the magical CSI is performed
[12-Jul-2014 22:52:40]  <IllFlower> All right, it looks like people want to check out the crime scene.
[12-Jul-2014 22:52:49]  <IllFlower> Why don't we do that, then.
[12-Jul-2014 22:52:53]  <Rig> “Kinomoto, we’re going to have to get permission from higher up before we can do anything around your rituals.” Kazuki holds out his hand. “Be safe.”
[12-Jul-2014 22:57:23]  <IllFlower> Yuuya gives Kazuki's hand a shake. "Yeah."
[12-Jul-2014 22:57:36]  <IllFlower> FFWD>>
[12-Jul-2014 22:58:45]  <IllFlower> The witch attack took place underneath the landing on one side of a river bridge.
[12-Jul-2014 22:59:11]  <IllFlower> The concrete supports look pockmarked, but they've probably been that way for years.
[12-Jul-2014 22:59:33]  <IllFlower> Outside of that, there aren't really any visible signs of a battle here.
[12-Jul-2014 23:00:03]  <Rig> Not that we really expect that from a battle where the group isn’t involved. Most emgirls don’t have a habit of burning down a school or blowing up a trainyard.
[12-Jul-2014 23:00:06]  <IllFlower> The Conservators' footsteps crunch in the gravel on the riverbank.
[12-Jul-2014 23:00:51]  <BGTB2005> Rig: or a baseball diamond
[12-Jul-2014 23:01:04]  <Alicia> (RIP in peace trainyard.)
[12-Jul-2014 23:01:05]  <IllFlower> It's still hot, so the ready availability of cool river water is much appreciated.
[12-Jul-2014 23:01:15]  <ponicalica> except by Rin
[12-Jul-2014 23:01:21]  <ponicalica> and possibly Ayako
[12-Jul-2014 23:02:03]  <Rig> Megumi and Kinomoto are the only two involved in the fight, right?
[12-Jul-2014 23:02:15]  <IllFlower> As far as we know, yes.
[12-Jul-2014 23:03:25]  <IllFlower> What's the plan?
[12-Jul-2014 23:04:01]  <Rig> See if the magical presence of Kotomi is here at all?
[12-Jul-2014 23:04:06]  <IllFlower> If you want to do some discovery I suspect you could summon the remnants of the witch.
[12-Jul-2014 23:04:14]  <Rig> Hahahaha.
[12-Jul-2014 23:04:20]  <Rig> That seems like a good way to get us killed.
[12-Jul-2014 23:04:21]  <Rig> Let’s do that.
[12-Jul-2014 23:04:23]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: I was about to suggest pulling in whatever magical energy was still in the area
[12-Jul-2014 23:04:57]  <BGTB2005> summoning the witch remnants, pulling in any leftover magic energy...
[12-Jul-2014 23:04:59]  <BGTB2005> same thing, right?
[12-Jul-2014 23:05:06]  <IllFlower> Well, all we've seen so far this arc is demonic attacks, so this thing isn't going to be all that powerful.
[12-Jul-2014 23:05:27]  <ponicalica> And we've got four magical girls^W^W initiates.
[12-Jul-2014 23:06:16]  <Rig> Shall we do that then?
[12-Jul-2014 23:06:24]  <ponicalica> Works for me.  BGTB2005, Alicia?
[12-Jul-2014 23:06:28]  <Alicia> Yup.
[12-Jul-2014 23:06:29]  <BGTB2005> sure
[12-Jul-2014 23:06:41]  <IllFlower> The spells are probably an individual thing. Unless you want the four of you to each get a quarter of the information, haha.
[12-Jul-2014 23:07:09]  <Rig> Well, Ayako should probably do it.
[12-Jul-2014 23:07:35]  <ponicalica> Right.
[12-Jul-2014 23:07:36]  <IllFlower> (I also only have 4d6 2d10 `_`)
[12-Jul-2014 23:07:55]  <Rig> Heh
[12-Jul-2014 23:08:08]  <IllFlower> Okay, so let's try and beat information out of the witch.
[12-Jul-2014 23:08:19]  <IllFlower> Super showdown!
[12-Jul-2014 23:10:28]  <ponicalica> The stakes are information, and I'm the only participant? (just confirming)
[12-Jul-2014 23:10:52]  <Rig> It’d be overkill for IllFlower if anyone else joined in.
[12-Jul-2014 23:11:45]  <Rig> What’s the starting arena?
[12-Jul-2014 23:12:12]  <ponicalica> I think witch battles are automatically the "deadly magic" arena
[12-Jul-2014 23:12:21]  <IllFlower> Yeah, basically.
[12-Jul-2014 23:12:27]  <Rig> Right.
[12-Jul-2014 23:12:41]  <ponicalica> so Ac+Wl
[12-Jul-2014 23:12:44]  <IllFlower> Yup.
[12-Jul-2014 23:12:47]  * BGTB2005 looks at stats
[12-Jul-2014 23:12:47]  <ponicalica> @dice new 5d6 4d6
[12-Jul-2014 23:12:47]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Rolled 1 1 1 3 4 4 5 5 6 = 30. Bank now has 1 1 1 3 4 4 5 5 6 = 30.
[12-Jul-2014 23:12:56]  <IllFlower> @dice new 4d6 2d10
[12-Jul-2014 23:12:56]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 1 2 2 4 6 8 = 23. Bank now has 1 2 2 4 6 8 = 23.
[12-Jul-2014 23:13:00]  <IllFlower> Oh, hey, an 8.
[12-Jul-2014 23:13:11]  <IllFlower> ponicalica can raise.
[12-Jul-2014 23:16:09]  <ponicalica> hmmmm, what would be a good start
[12-Jul-2014 23:16:26]  <IllFlower> The first words of the spell, presumably. :p
[12-Jul-2014 23:17:01]  <Alicia> ("Open, damn it.")
[12-Jul-2014 23:19:03]  <ponicalica> Ayako begins with the words of a spell to quickly draw out the form of whatever demonic magic remains at the scene.  The suddenness startles even the other initiates watching.
[12-Jul-2014 23:19:11]  <ponicalica> @dice use 5 5
[12-Jul-2014 23:19:11]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Used 5 5 = 10. Bank now has 1 1 1 3 4 4 6 = 20.
[12-Jul-2014 23:20:27]  <IllFlower> A shadow falls on Ayako's eyes. She looks up to see one of the cables of the bridge above them blocking the sun... wait, was this a suspension bridge before?
[12-Jul-2014 23:21:06]  <IllFlower> There's a sound of inhuman writhing as wisps of black smoke rise from the witch's form.
[12-Jul-2014 23:21:20]  <IllFlower> Step 1: Drag the witch out. Check.
[12-Jul-2014 23:21:23]  <Rig> hahaha
[12-Jul-2014 23:21:28]  <IllFlower> @dice use 6 2 2
[12-Jul-2014 23:21:28]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 2 2 6 = 10. Bank now has 1 4 8 = 13.
[12-Jul-2014 23:22:31]  <IllFlower> Displeased by being so abruptly awoken, the witch strikes out.
[12-Jul-2014 23:22:59]  <IllFlower> A long cable snaps off of the bridge above and extends towards Ayako's throat.
[12-Jul-2014 23:23:06]  <IllFlower> @dice use 4 8
[12-Jul-2014 23:23:06]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 4 8 = 12. Bank now has 1 = 1.
[12-Jul-2014 23:23:21]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that's right. I've still got 1.
[12-Jul-2014 23:23:31]  <IllFlower> Whatcha gonna do about *that*, huh?
[12-Jul-2014 23:23:49]  <ponicalica> Pull in dangerous magic, I think.
[12-Jul-2014 23:24:13]  <ponicalica> since, well, we're probably in a witch labyrinth now.
[12-Jul-2014 23:24:22]  <ponicalica> @dice add 2d10
[12-Jul-2014 23:24:22]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Rolled 2 9 = 11. Bank now has 1 1 1 2 3 4 4 6 9 = 31.
[12-Jul-2014 23:24:32]  <IllFlower> "9"
[12-Jul-2014 23:24:35]  <IllFlower> Hahahaha.
[12-Jul-2014 23:24:37]  <BGTB2005> hahaha
[12-Jul-2014 23:24:43]  <Alicia> Damn.
[12-Jul-2014 23:25:12]  <Rig> Bit of overkill
[12-Jul-2014 23:25:15]  <ponicalica> a bit
[12-Jul-2014 23:25:28]  <BGTB2005> it looks like exactly enough kill to me
[12-Jul-2014 23:25:44]  <IllFlower> He only needed a 6 to see.
[12-Jul-2014 23:25:56]  <IllFlower> Then again, all you need is kill.

[12-Jul-2014 23:27:59]  <ponicalica> Ayako twirls away from the long cable, pushing off in time to cleanly avoid the snapped cable even as it seems to try to bend its way towards Ayako.
[12-Jul-2014 23:28:03]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@182.55.189.100> has joined #madokamadness

[12-Jul-2014 23:28:13]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Used 4 9 = 13. Bank now has 1 1 1 2 3 4 6 = 18.
[12-Jul-2014 23:28:54]  <BGTB2005> you have a perfectly sufficient three there
[12-Jul-2014 23:29:11]  <IllFlower> He only needs 1.
[12-Jul-2014 23:29:20]  <IllFlower> Not like he's got a reason to conserve. :p
[12-Jul-2014 23:29:33]  <ponicalica> yeah but it doesn't really matter, since I'm pretty sure demonic influence can't escalate or pull in items.
[12-Jul-2014 23:29:54]  <BGTB2005> something silly like 4 6 for his next raise?
[12-Jul-2014 23:30:25]  <IllFlower> I can't do much of anything.
[12-Jul-2014 23:30:34]  <Rig> The witch gives.
[12-Jul-2014 23:30:36]  <IllFlower> Just whoop that witch's sorry little ass.
[12-Jul-2014 23:32:56]  <ponicalica> Ayako takes a long look at the witch's form before she wordlessly pushes out a final blast of light from the palm of her hand, engulfing the witch in it
[12-Jul-2014 23:33:07]  <ponicalica> @dice use 4 6
[12-Jul-2014 23:33:07]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Used 4 6 = 10. Bank now has 1 1 1 2 3 = 8.
[12-Jul-2014 23:33:14]  <ponicalica> the witch gives etc
[12-Jul-2014 23:33:18]  <IllFlower> lol.
[12-Jul-2014 23:35:15]  <IllFlower> As the light begins to eat through the witch's darkened form, Ayako whispers an incantation, causing the whole scene to freeze. She wants to try and read what she can about the witch off the remaining spots of darkness before consigning it all to dust.
[12-Jul-2014 23:35:34]  <IllFlower> Kazuki and company squint up at the scene above them.
[12-Jul-2014 23:36:42]  <Rig> (“That cloud looks like a girraffe.”)
[12-Jul-2014 23:37:33]  <IllFlower> "Did you hear?" the twisted runes spell out. "Hm?" "Someone spotted Kotomi Taniguchi here in town." "The runaway cult leader?" "Seriously?" "Hasn't she been evading the Conservators for months?"
[12-Jul-2014 23:38:25]  <IllFlower> Between the words, though, there is no sign of the twisted ball of destructive emotion that's usually at the core of these monsters, just more of Ayako's light.
[12-Jul-2014 23:40:14]  <Rig> “It doesn’t seem to tell us more than we already knew.”
[12-Jul-2014 23:40:41]  <IllFlower> Seems like a strangely hollow witch.
[12-Jul-2014 23:41:31]  <IllFlower> All rumor and no substance. Isn't that odd.
[12-Jul-2014 23:43:04]  <Rig> Hm.
[12-Jul-2014 23:43:44]  <Rig> “Where is the emotion from this witch? Kinomoto said it was powerful, but there isn’t anything here.”
[12-Jul-2014 23:44:46]  <ponicalica> "It almost felt more like the echo of another initiate's attack, even."
[12-Jul-2014 23:45:36]  * IllFlower nods sagely
[12-Jul-2014 23:46:20]  <Rig> “Someone attacked Megumi and disguised it as a witch.” Kazuki mutters to himself. “That’s deep magic."
[12-Jul-2014 23:47:33]  <IllFlower> Deep magic, or heavily corrupted magic.
[12-Jul-2014 23:48:00]  <BGTB2005> "Do you think it might be this Taniguchi person?"
[12-Jul-2014 23:48:42]  <Rig> “Shii did say that she was stealing books."
[12-Jul-2014 23:49:42]  <IllFlower> Seems odd that someone trying to hide would be constructing witches from rumors about herself, though.
[12-Jul-2014 23:50:59]  <Rig> True.
[12-Jul-2014 23:51:24]  <IllFlower> I'm going to call a break in a few minutes. I assume some people would like to eat.
[12-Jul-2014 23:51:40]  <Rig> Yeah, I would.
[12-Jul-2014 23:51:43]  <IllFlower> Let's conclude this scene, though.
[12-Jul-2014 23:52:22]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at the girls. “Does any of this seem familar to you?"
[12-Jul-2014 23:52:31]  <IllFlower> Hm, this does seem like the kind of thing you'd do as a distraction...
[12-Jul-2014 23:52:33]  <ponicalica> "I wouldn't count it out.  Though it also sort of felt like an illusion or something."
[12-Jul-2014 23:53:14]  <ponicalica> (it's actually Michi Akase)
[12-Jul-2014 23:53:20]  <IllFlower> I wonder what might need distracting from.
[12-Jul-2014 23:53:30]  <Rig> “But what are they trying to draw attention away from? Who would start rumors like this?”
[12-Jul-2014 23:53:39]  <Alicia> (I dunno, maybe the magical civil war thing.)
[12-Jul-2014 23:54:58]  <IllFlower> What else has been happening lately?
[12-Jul-2014 23:55:04]  <ponicalica> Alicia: maybe you should have Hikari mention this, hint hint
[12-Jul-2014 23:55:56]  <IllFlower> That was the whole Emi-Satsuki thing.
[12-Jul-2014 23:56:21]  <Alicia> (Wait so no, or.)
[12-Jul-2014 23:57:01]  <Alicia> (No @ mentioning it)
[12-Jul-2014 23:57:14]  <Rig> Kazuki doesn’t know what’s been happening. He’s been doing his own thing elsewhere.
[12-Jul-2014 23:57:23]  <IllFlower> The sentry mentioned that there were attacks happening elsewhere, no?
[12-Jul-2014 23:58:55]  <Rig> So, are we being drawn away from the actual attacks?
[12-Jul-2014 23:59:11]  <Alicia> "I can't speak for the magic, but before you joined up with us, we were doing some research for a magical civil war. We apprehended one of the important people, at least."
[12-Jul-2014 23:59:28]  <BGTB2005> Rig: possible
[12-Jul-2014 23:59:37]  <Alicia> "Though, our efforts haven't neutralized the attacks..."
[12-Jul-2014 23:59:43]  <ponicalica> Rig: we're being drawn away from something
[13-Jul-2014 00:00:32]  <IllFlower> I can't see why else you'd make a fake witch unless you just really hate people.
[13-Jul-2014 00:01:10]  <Rig> “Why would a distraction draw us toward a candidate for prophecy though? Do they want us to think Kinomoto is working with Kotomi?”
[13-Jul-2014 00:03:07]  <IllFlower> That's less clear.
[13-Jul-2014 00:04:28]  <Rig> Do we know anything about Megumi?
[13-Jul-2014 00:05:28]  <IllFlower> In particular?
[13-Jul-2014 00:06:19]  <Rig> Like, does she normally work with Kinomoto and the sentry?
[13-Jul-2014 00:06:24]  <Rig> Or are they all free agents.
[13-Jul-2014 00:06:36]  <IllFlower> She's got the same familiar as Yuuya.
[13-Jul-2014 00:06:51]  <IllFlower> Sentry's a Conservator, they've got their own familiars to report to.
[13-Jul-2014 00:07:04]  *** SF_Sorrow <SF_Sorrow@eduroam-241-61.ucsc.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[13-Jul-2014 00:07:31]  <Rig> Hm.
[13-Jul-2014 00:08:16]  <IllFlower> There is the possibility Kotomi's not really involved with what happened here at all. But then the question would be why anyone would want someone to think that she is...
[13-Jul-2014 00:08:56]  <Rig> Hm.
[13-Jul-2014 00:11:20]  <Rig> I don’t know where to go from here.
[13-Jul-2014 00:12:01]  <IllFlower> Might be prudent to head back to Yuuya's stomping grounds.
[13-Jul-2014 00:13:03]  <IllFlower> You guys were headed there anyway, right?
[13-Jul-2014 00:13:06]  <Rig> Yeah.
[13-Jul-2014 00:13:28]  <IllFlower> Anyone else got any theories, before we do that?
[13-Jul-2014 00:14:21]  <BGTB2005> Rin would probably like to blame Michi, but what are the chances we're going to run into her again :V
[13-Jul-2014 00:14:31]  <ponicalica> you never know
[13-Jul-2014 00:14:36]  <ponicalica> she did get reassigned somewhere, presumably...
[13-Jul-2014 00:14:56]  <Alicia> My only other thought is that the witch is just there as a red herring for something else in the vicinity but that's over-thinking things so
[13-Jul-2014 00:15:15]  <Rig> Kazuki assumes his old friend is being framed/targetted for induction into Kotomi’s cult.
[13-Jul-2014 00:15:43]  <IllFlower> Sounds like the sort of conclusion he'd be led to here.
[13-Jul-2014 00:16:04]  <Rig> I need to feed my cats.
[13-Jul-2014 00:16:23]  <BGTB2005> slightly more seriously, Rin thinks someone, probably Kotomi, wants Yuuya dead for whatever reason
[13-Jul-2014 00:16:40]  <IllFlower> Why don't we break here and pick up with heading to Yuuya's town later?
[13-Jul-2014 00:17:00]  <ponicalica> okay
[13-Jul-2014 00:17:04]  <IllFlower> Lots of unexplained questions that need answering.
[13-Jul-2014 00:17:45]  <ponicalica> Yuuya was the one that led them to this area, righT?
[13-Jul-2014 00:18:03]  <IllFlower> This area?
[13-Jul-2014 00:18:06]  <IllFlower> The bridge?
[13-Jul-2014 00:18:09]  <ponicalica> yeah
[13-Jul-2014 00:18:16]  <ponicalica> or told them where it was?
[13-Jul-2014 00:18:29]  <IllFlower> Well, he's the only one conscious after the attack.
[13-Jul-2014 00:18:40]  <Rig> So, what’s the plan?
[13-Jul-2014 00:18:43]  <IllFlower> There *was* a witch here, though.
[13-Jul-2014 00:19:38]  <IllFlower> Well, I can run session until 10/7p if you guys want to resume afterward.
[13-Jul-2014 00:19:49]  <IllFlower> If not, we'll do the usual.
[13-Jul-2014 00:19:53]  <Rig> I think I’d like to call it a night.
[13-Jul-2014 00:20:02]  <ponicalica> I think this is a good stopping point.
[13-Jul-2014 00:20:06]  <IllFlower> All right, we'll resume next week.
[13-Jul-2014 00:20:14]  <BGTB2005> either way's fine with me
[13-Jul-2014 00:20:17]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, everyone. Don't bang your heads too hard against this one.
[13-Jul-2014 00:20:21]  <Rig> Thanks for the session, IllFlower.
[13-Jul-2014 00:20:27]  <IllFlower> Until next time.
