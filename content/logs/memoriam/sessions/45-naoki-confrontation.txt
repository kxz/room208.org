[01-Jul-2015 22:41:52]  <IllFlower> OKAY LET'S GO
[01-Jul-2015 22:42:38]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Dark Heresy^W^W Emdogs
[01-Jul-2015 22:43:31]  <IllFlower> Last time we found out where our presumed murderer might be: vacationing in a country inn.
[01-Jul-2015 22:43:40]  <IllFlower> Pretty chill of him, don't you think?
[01-Jul-2015 22:43:54]  <IllFlower> So, what's the plan, my friends?
[01-Jul-2015 22:44:10]  <Icon> Everyone can appreciate a relaxing stay at a country inn. Except maybe Rin.
[01-Jul-2015 22:45:24]  <Icon> So we could either storm the place, or gather more info somehow. One is more reasonable than the other. One is also more fitting.
[01-Jul-2015 22:45:27]  <Icon> for us*
[01-Jul-2015 22:45:30]  <BGTB2005> I think some rest and recuperation and then finding the guy and kicking his teeth in
[01-Jul-2015 22:45:35]  <Calica> well, how much more info can we even gather
[01-Jul-2015 22:45:42]  <Icon> Mmm.
[01-Jul-2015 22:46:50]  <Rig> I dunno. We could gather info about the amenities of the inn.
[01-Jul-2015 22:47:49]  <IllFlower> Are you planning a vacation?
[01-Jul-2015 22:48:04]  <IllFlower> "I'm not going unless it has an attached hot spring."
[01-Jul-2015 22:48:14]  <Rig> Kazuki could use a break.
[01-Jul-2015 22:48:33]  <Calica> Floorplan in order to plan an attack, I guess, but that seems like a detail that doesn't matter too much to our narration
[01-Jul-2015 22:49:20]  <BGTB2005> some relaxing at the inn before magicking the guy to death sounds good
[01-Jul-2015 22:49:23]  <Rig> But honestly, yeah, I dunno if gathering more information is very useful.
[01-Jul-2015 22:49:33]  <IllFlower> I was thinking more a distinction between going in with guns blazing and... not doing that.
[01-Jul-2015 22:50:27]  <Rig> We could just confront him normally. Claim we believe he's responsible for the deaths and on a mission of vengeance.
[01-Jul-2015 22:52:02]  <IllFlower> Normal? What? You can't do things normally!
[01-Jul-2015 22:52:13]  <Rig> Dramatically then
[01-Jul-2015 22:52:20]  <IllFlower> Well, anyway, so I suppose that's the "stroll in the front door and ask" strategy.
[01-Jul-2015 22:52:20]  <BGTB2005> isn't that our normal though?
[01-Jul-2015 22:52:56]  <Rig> Do we have any solid evidence?
[01-Jul-2015 22:53:11]  <Rig> I mean, the sorta-confession kinda.
[01-Jul-2015 22:53:14]  <IllFlower> Righteous anger?
[01-Jul-2015 22:53:31]  <Rig> I mean, that's a motivator for at least two people.
[01-Jul-2015 22:54:06]  <Rig> Anyone else have other ideas?
[01-Jul-2015 22:54:37]  <Calica> Not really
[01-Jul-2015 22:54:46]  <Calica> Ambush, maybe, but he's probably paranoid and holed in at this point
[01-Jul-2015 22:55:36]  <Rig> I like the straight up confront the guy and expect him not to try to kill us (like always).
[01-Jul-2015 22:56:04]  <BGTB2005> ...would it have been possible to get the magical fingerprint off of whatever was possessing Murata or is it too late for that now/wouldn't have given us anything?
[01-Jul-2015 22:56:50]  <IllFlower> It's a bit late for that now.
[01-Jul-2015 22:58:24]  <IllFlower> I guess we're just strolling in, then.
[01-Jul-2015 22:58:30]  <BGTB2005> well I guess we can add 'an inn' to the list of things destroyed by the conservators...
[01-Jul-2015 22:58:59]  <Rig> I'm good with that, no one else seems to have any other strong feelings.
[01-Jul-2015 22:59:03]  <IllFlower> Uh, I don't think the insurance company's going to be happy with that.
[01-Jul-2015 22:59:17]  <Calica> IllFlower: magical girls are an insurance company's worst enemy
[01-Jul-2015 22:59:25]  <Icon> o7
[01-Jul-2015 22:59:33]  <Icon> Yeah I'm fine with direct confrontation.
[01-Jul-2015 22:59:48]  <Icon> I don't think any of us really know subtle anyway.
[01-Jul-2015 22:59:52]  <IllFlower> Shioiri, where the inn is, is about two hours away by train. It's a long ride.
[01-Jul-2015 22:59:53]  <Calica> And I think direct confrontation is basically how it's going to go, yeah
[01-Jul-2015 23:00:00]  <BGTB2005> I don't think our groups been good with doing things any other way?
[01-Jul-2015 23:01:02]  <IllFlower> It's already evening by the time the Conservators arrive at the station, which is little more than a wooden box with a bored-looking middle-aged staff member sitting at a desk in one corner.
[01-Jul-2015 23:01:59]  <IllFlower> He points the way towards the inn, not batting an eye at the motley group of youngsters disembarking from the train in the middle of nowhere.
[01-Jul-2015 23:03:45]  <Rig> Totally normal.
[01-Jul-2015 23:03:49]  <Rig> Happens a lot here.
[01-Jul-2015 23:04:17]  <Calica> probably students on a vacation or something
[01-Jul-2015 23:04:26]  <Calica> japan has vacations, right?
[01-Jul-2015 23:04:54]  <IllFlower> The road up - and it is up, about a kilometer ascending a hill - goes from paved to loose gravel distressingly quickly. Hope you wore good shoes.
[01-Jul-2015 23:06:19]  <IllFlower> Soon enough, the inn comes into view. It looks like it's been standing for at least a hundred years. The name is written on a plate hanging over the entrance, though none of the Conservators can figure out how exactly it's supposed to be pronounced.
[01-Jul-2015 23:07:36]  <Calica> so this is a really traditionally old japanese hotel?
[01-Jul-2015 23:07:50]  <IllFlower> An older woman stands behind the reception desk in the otherwise empty foyer. She tilts her head quizzically as Kazuki walks in. By the time the girls file in, she looks positively baffled.
[01-Jul-2015 23:08:29]  <Calica> ("We're looking for a Prophet, do you think you can tell me his room number?")
[01-Jul-2015 23:09:02]  <IllFlower> "Can I help you?" she asks.
[01-Jul-2015 23:09:05]  <Rig> This is where we ask about the hot springs, right?
[01-Jul-2015 23:10:28]  <IllFlower> Uh, sure.
[01-Jul-2015 23:11:23]  <Rig> Kazuki smiles at the woman, "We were supposed to meet Miyama here. Could you tell us where we can find him?"
[01-Jul-2015 23:13:27]  <IllFlower> "Miyama?" She ponders for a second, then: "I can tell him that someone's looking for him here. How should I introduce you?"
[01-Jul-2015 23:15:07]  <Rig> "He'll know me by mister Sakura, I believe." (I don't remember how names work)
[01-Jul-2015 23:15:48]  <IllFlower> "Just a moment."
[01-Jul-2015 23:16:08]  <IllFlower> The woman disappears behind a curtain at the back of the room.
[01-Jul-2015 23:16:25]  <Calica> Rig: you probably want whichever honorifics go to "mister Sakura" anyways I think?
[01-Jul-2015 23:16:41]  <Rig> She seems fairly unpreturbed by Kazuki's silent entourage.
[01-Jul-2015 23:16:43]  <IllFlower> A deep silence settles down on the room.
[01-Jul-2015 23:17:04]  <Rig> Kazuki wonders for a moment if he should try to mask the presence of all their magic.
[01-Jul-2015 23:17:59]  <Rig> He doesn't bother though. Perhaps the mesh of magic will better approximate his father's, who will probably be the first person Miyama would think of.
[01-Jul-2015 23:18:40]  <IllFlower> The lights flicker slightly, as if they're candles in a light breeze.
[01-Jul-2015 23:19:05]  <Rig> Kazuki glances over at Ayako for reassurance.
[01-Jul-2015 23:19:18]  <BGTB2005> Rin thinks for a moment, then asks Kazuki, "You know Miyama?"
[01-Jul-2015 23:19:45]  <Rig> "I imagine my father does."
[01-Jul-2015 23:20:22]  <Calica> do we know your father's a prophet?
[01-Jul-2015 23:20:36]  <Rig> I don't think he's kept it a secret.
[01-Jul-2015 23:20:47]  <BGTB2005> I'm running with rin pretty much just learning that :/
[01-Jul-2015 23:21:08]  <Rig> That'd be fine. We'll just say that he hasn't kept it hushed up, but he didn't advertise it.
[01-Jul-2015 23:21:18]  <Calica> "Your father...he's a Prophet, right?"
[01-Jul-2015 23:21:26]  <Calica> (Ayako is more likely to remember than Rin is)
[01-Jul-2015 23:22:49]  <Rig> Kazuki nods, "He is. Miyama would at least know him by that."
[01-Jul-2015 23:23:43]  <Rig> "She's been a while," Kazuki says idly.
[01-Jul-2015 23:24:39]  <IllFlower> Oh, I was waiting for you to finish.
[01-Jul-2015 23:25:12]  <Calica> suddenly, without warning, Hikari gets struck by a lightning bolt
[01-Jul-2015 23:25:20]  <Rig> Oh, feel free to ignore that then. I just didn't know if Rin wanted to push further about the Prophetness.
[01-Jul-2015 23:26:01]  <Icon> I didn't know what to say :I
[01-Jul-2015 23:26:36]  <IllFlower> The Prophetness would make a good alt hip-hop album title.
[01-Jul-2015 23:26:47]  <Rig> Hikari would probably have a lot of the Prophets' names memorized.
[01-Jul-2015 23:26:49]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[01-Jul-2015 23:28:08]  <IllFlower> "Not the Sakura I was expecting."
[01-Jul-2015 23:28:37]  <IllFlower> The voice is deep and a little too calm. Like the villain in some British film.
[01-Jul-2015 23:29:05]  *** Xeniera <~Max@75-175-57-214.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[01-Jul-2015 23:29:05]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Xeniera
[01-Jul-2015 23:29:54]  <Xeniera> Well, I have a car of my own now
[01-Jul-2015 23:30:02]  <IllFlower> Naoki Miyama is dressed in a light yukata. Unseasonable, considering it's still January.
[01-Jul-2015 23:30:12]  <Xeniera> oh oops
[01-Jul-2015 23:30:16]  <BGTB2005> magic, clearly
[01-Jul-2015 23:30:37]  <Calica> the arc ends with Prophet Miyama dropping a car on the Conservators
[01-Jul-2015 23:30:58]  <IllFlower> "What brings you here?"
[01-Jul-2015 23:31:32]  <Calica> "We're here to talk about some recent issues with the Consilium Renascens."
[01-Jul-2015 23:31:44]  <Rig> Kazuki steels himself to address the man... and finds himself cut off by Ayako.
[01-Jul-2015 23:31:53]  <IllFlower> pwned
[01-Jul-2015 23:32:35]  <IllFlower> "You'll have to forgive me. I wasn't aware the council was under the oversight of the Conservators."
[01-Jul-2015 23:34:53]  <Rig> Is Ayako gonna continue?
[01-Jul-2015 23:35:44]  <Calica> Ayako ponders a response.  A breach of the Order's heirarchy must be very carefully considered.
[01-Jul-2015 23:35:58]  <Calica> (Her pondering leaves her open to getting cut off by Kazuki or Hikari)
[01-Jul-2015 23:36:03]  <Calica> (not putting much stock in Rin tbh)
[01-Jul-2015 23:37:01]  <Rig> "There were some irregularities with the council. We were sent to investigate them and we've been lead to you."
[01-Jul-2015 23:37:36]  <Rig> "Do you mind if we go somewhere private?" Kazuki says, feeling that this conversation would be better suited outside of the lobby of this inn.
[01-Jul-2015 23:39:05]  <IllFlower> Miyama thinks for a moment.
[01-Jul-2015 23:39:19]  <IllFlower> "I do have a room," he then says, with a cordial smile.
[01-Jul-2015 23:39:32]  <Rig> Oh, Miyama-san, you're so forward.
[01-Jul-2015 23:40:24]  <Rig> Kazuki nods, "That might be more appropriate, if you don't mind."
[01-Jul-2015 23:41:48]  <IllFlower> they_had_lots_of_sex_afterwards
[01-Jul-2015 23:42:55]  <Icon> Woah, woah, woah
[01-Jul-2015 23:43:13]  <IllFlower> The back of Miyama's room opens onto a view from the top of the hill onto a number of small villages in the distance. He does at least have nice taste in vacation accommodations.
[01-Jul-2015 23:43:32]  <BGTB2005> Naokai's what, over twice Kazuki's age?
[01-Jul-2015 23:43:43]  <Calica> BGTB2005: i see you don't understand true love :p
[01-Jul-2015 23:44:07]  <IllFlower> Miyama gestures to the Conservators to enter, closing the sliding door behind them afterwards.
[01-Jul-2015 23:44:07]  <BGTB2005> the Kazuki/Naoki shippers won't care
[01-Jul-2015 23:44:36]  <Calica> let me guess, the door will next make an ominous *click*
[01-Jul-2015 23:44:54]  <IllFlower> "Tea?" he asks. A pot sits on the room's center table.
[01-Jul-2015 23:45:09]  <Calica> ("Depends, do you have cookies?")
[01-Jul-2015 23:45:13]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[01-Jul-2015 23:47:26]  <IllFlower> "Guess not," he says, taking a seat at one end of the table. "Well, then, you'll have to describe to me what these... irregularities are that brought you all the way out here."
[01-Jul-2015 23:47:39]  <Rig> Sorry, stepped out to grab a glass of water.
[01-Jul-2015 23:48:26]  <Calica> "Are you familiar with a Takako Murata?"
[01-Jul-2015 23:48:47]  <Calica> "She was the only voter on a surprising number of initiatiations."
[01-Jul-2015 23:50:33]  <IllFlower> "The council messenger, yes. Voting?"
[01-Jul-2015 23:51:29]  <Calica> "That's what appeared when we checked the messages.  That and something about a key?"
[01-Jul-2015 23:52:56]  <IllFlower> Miyama's face lights up with an obviously feigned curiosity.
[01-Jul-2015 23:53:27]  <Icon> He sounds really punchable right now.
[01-Jul-2015 23:53:28]  <IllFlower> "This is very unusual. What is this key you're talking about?"
[01-Jul-2015 23:53:59]  <IllFlower> He offered you tea! Come, now, where is your courtesy?
[01-Jul-2015 23:54:21]  <Icon> Point.
[01-Jul-2015 23:54:30]  <Rig> Kazuki certainly would have accepted tea, but someone couldn't wait for me to get back from getting water.
[01-Jul-2015 23:58:03]  <Rig> I dunno where Ayako was going with the key thing.
[01-Jul-2015 23:58:11]  <IllFlower> So are we punching him, answering his question, what?
[01-Jul-2015 23:58:16]  <Calica> the key thing was something murata called herself
[01-Jul-2015 23:58:32]  <Calica> "It's something Murata called herself when we confronted her."
[01-Jul-2015 23:58:39]  <Rig> Yeah, but I don't have anything interesting to say about answering his question other than... well that.
[02-Jul-2015 00:01:19]  <Icon> Same. :v
[02-Jul-2015 00:01:30]  <IllFlower> Sorry, just a sec.
[02-Jul-2015 00:04:36]  <IllFlower> Miyama laughs. "Shot the messenger, did we...
[02-Jul-2015 00:04:44]  <IllFlower> "I'm sorry, but I'm still not sure what you're getting at."
[02-Jul-2015 00:05:06]  <IllFlower> He drums on the table with the fingers on his right hand.
[02-Jul-2015 00:05:23]  <IllFlower> "I'm sure you know this, but I resigned from the Consilium Renascens several months ago."
[02-Jul-2015 00:06:30]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@232.166-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 206 seconds)
[02-Jul-2015 00:06:36]  <Rig> "The thing is, Murata tells us you were the one who suggested she act as their messenger. Murata's forged records continued recruiting initiates from a school that made no sense for continued recruiting." Kazuki says. 
[02-Jul-2015 00:07:23]  <Rig> "We were wondering if you were aware of Murata's possession when you suggested her."
[02-Jul-2015 00:08:06]  <IllFlower> Miyama's eyebrows dart upward. "Possession?"
[02-Jul-2015 00:09:28]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@232.166-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[02-Jul-2015 00:10:16]  <IllFlower> Then: "I certainly wouldn't have recommended someone I knew to be compromised."
[02-Jul-2015 00:10:21]  <Rig> "Possession. Murata was being forced to deliver those forgeries. When we confronted her she mentioned..." Kazuki trails off as he remembers something.
[02-Jul-2015 00:10:39]  <IllFlower> Do tell.
[02-Jul-2015 00:11:35]  <BGTB2005> "Murata said something about something being locked away." Rin looks to Ayako. "What were the words she used?"
[02-Jul-2015 00:11:58]  <Rig> Kazuki turns back to Miyama. "Murata mentioned your daughter. We have reason to believe that whoever was forging those records was targeting one of the judges from her case."
[02-Jul-2015 00:12:10]  <Rig> "But you don't know the names of any of the judges, do you?"
[02-Jul-2015 00:13:53]  <IllFlower> "Of course. They were kept under seal."
[02-Jul-2015 00:15:03]  <Rig> I do not know.
[02-Jul-2015 00:16:10]  <IllFlower> Eh?
[02-Jul-2015 00:16:17]  <Calica> where to go next, probably
[02-Jul-2015 00:16:33]  <BGTB2005> punching, clearly
[02-Jul-2015 00:16:37]  <Calica> Ayako turns to Rin.  "I think it was «history will be unlocked».  What this has to do with Sena, I'm not sure."
[02-Jul-2015 00:16:39]  <Rig> Yeah, that partially. But I'm also not super convinced that Miyama is the person we want.
[02-Jul-2015 00:16:51]  <Rig> Which is probably dumb.
[02-Jul-2015 00:18:23]  <Icon> At most he knows but is pretty reticent about really, well, helping us much.
[02-Jul-2015 00:18:45]  <IllFlower> Well, yeah, if it *is* him he's going to shut the hell up.
[02-Jul-2015 00:19:29]  <Rig> "Do you know anyone else who would be particularly motivated to attack those judges?"
[02-Jul-2015 00:19:48]  <Icon> IllFlower: And by that I mean I don't know how to un-shut him up
[02-Jul-2015 00:21:23]  <IllFlower> "I have to admit, if you're looking for someone with a motive, I'd be close to the top of the list.
[02-Jul-2015 00:21:37]  <BGTB2005> "I think Murata said something about the father tuning the key, and 'the daughter is locked away'?" Rin says to Ayako.
[02-Jul-2015 00:21:54]  <IllFlower> "Let me ask, though. *You* seem to be very familiar with the identity of that judge."
[02-Jul-2015 00:22:51]  <Rig> "They came to us concerned about the attacks," Kazuki says.
[02-Jul-2015 00:23:40]  <IllFlower> "To you. Conservators.
[02-Jul-2015 00:23:45]  <IllFlower> "Why would that be their first thought?"
[02-Jul-2015 00:24:33]  <IllFlower> Miyama resumes drumming on the table.
[02-Jul-2015 00:24:53]  <IllFlower> "A judge, a Prophet, going to an initiate for assistance. Surely that's not the whole story."
[02-Jul-2015 00:25:52]  *** Medicine <~Vick@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[02-Jul-2015 00:26:26]  <Calica> "We were investigating the deaths of two initiates and it led us to you."
[02-Jul-2015 00:26:32]  <Rig> "An initiate?" Kazuki says. "A Conservator. It is our job to protect. Prophets aren't above help."
[02-Jul-2015 00:26:52]  <Rig> Perhaps we should try a conflict?
[02-Jul-2015 00:28:01]  <IllFlower> "Perhaps not, but even a Conservator would be rather far down the list for most Prophets.
[02-Jul-2015 00:28:19]  <IllFlower> "Unless... there were some kind of special relationship between them."
[02-Jul-2015 00:30:01]  <IllFlower> Miyama looks up and addresses his target directly. "Sakura? Is that indeed the case?"
[02-Jul-2015 00:30:36]  <Rig> "You know my name." Kazuki says.
[02-Jul-2015 00:30:42]  <IllFlower> I think it should be pretty clear what Miyama's after, but Kazuki?
[02-Jul-2015 00:31:46]  <Rig> I dunno. Outside of just getting the information from him, but I'm not terribly convinced that he's who we want.
[02-Jul-2015 00:33:16]  <IllFlower> Well, there's still conflict material. Miyama's trying to wheedle out that identity from Kazuki.
[02-Jul-2015 00:33:55]  <Rig> True, but if he doesn't already know that he doesn't have anything Kazuki really wants.
[02-Jul-2015 00:34:15]  <Rig> Kazuki stakes would simply be keeping the information secret.
[02-Jul-2015 00:34:18]  <BGTB2005> he probably does and just wants to confirm
[02-Jul-2015 00:34:58]  <IllFlower> I think it's pretty obvious Miyama knows or thinks he does.
[02-Jul-2015 00:35:23]  <Rig> So then the stakes would simply be finding out if he possessed Murata or made her forge documents.
[02-Jul-2015 00:35:39]  <IllFlower> Do you want to try and get him to confess to that, then?
[02-Jul-2015 00:35:51]  <Rig> Well, see, we've talked about that before...
[02-Jul-2015 00:36:07]  <Rig> Winning a conflict where the stakes are "confession" doesn't actually mean they did it. :P
[02-Jul-2015 00:36:38]  <IllFlower> Well, you'd have to go about it differently.
[02-Jul-2015 00:36:54]  <IllFlower> Either put him in a situation where he feels he has no option but to tell the truth, or make him think you're harmless.
[02-Jul-2015 00:37:42]  <IllFlower> I mean, you could always threaten him if you think that might work.
[02-Jul-2015 00:38:01]  <BGTB2005> but what good is a confession then?
[02-Jul-2015 00:38:02]  <Rig> Well, guilt or sorrow would be an interesting motivator.

[02-Jul-2015 01:04:49]  <IllFlower> No, not as far as I'm aware. It was supposed to be for, like, he wants stuff without actual escalation...

[02-Jul-2015 01:23:15]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yes. Your turn to raise, by the way.
[02-Jul-2015 01:24:57]  <Rig> "You seem fairly certain you know who this judge is," Kazuki says flatly. "But you're right. We should just present this evidence to the Prophets. I'm sure they won't notice a pattern in your family. And they certainly won't hold a bias toward your target." Kazuki stands up from the table.
[02-Jul-2015 01:25:53]  <Rig> So, I think this is pretty much Kazuki's last resort. He can't really get a confession from him without punching the snot out of him, so he's gonna go for baiting Miyama.

[02-Jul-2015 01:36:11]  <Rig> Short term and exp for Kazuki.
[02-Jul-2015 01:36:31]  <IllFlower> Miyama remains seated. "Seems I hit a nerve. Well, I trust you'll find your answer soon enough."
[02-Jul-2015 01:37:23]  *** AttObl is now known as AttObl|2Heart
[02-Jul-2015 01:38:09]  <Calica> Ayako stares at Kazuki as he begins to make his way to the door.
[02-Jul-2015 01:38:57]  <IllFlower> I sense a follow-up conflict happening...
[02-Jul-2015 01:39:59]  <Icon> Shwe goes witchy mode on him instead
[02-Jul-2015 01:40:00]  <BGTB2005> Rin watches Kazuki leave, then glares at Miyama
[02-Jul-2015 01:41:52]  <Calica> I kind of want a conflict, but I'm, ahem, conflicted as to whether Ayako should go all out or not?
[02-Jul-2015 01:42:18]  <Rig> I mean, if you feel motivated to have a conflict then there is probably one.
[02-Jul-2015 01:42:39]  <Icon> What do you have in mind?
[02-Jul-2015 01:42:50]  <BGTB2005> conflict sounds like the girls' style but I'm not sure what the sateks would be
[02-Jul-2015 01:42:56]  <BGTB2005> *stakes
[02-Jul-2015 01:43:04]  <Calica> BGTB2005: yeah, I'm not sure about stakes either
[02-Jul-2015 01:43:08]  <Calica> almost said steaks there, lol
[02-Jul-2015 01:43:33]  <BGTB2005> steak sounds good...
[02-Jul-2015 01:44:29]  <Rig> I used the exp fallout to roll Kazuki's relationship with his mom up to a d6.
[02-Jul-2015 01:45:00]  <IllFlower> Calica: Well, you could go primal witchiness.
[02-Jul-2015 01:45:19]  <Icon> Oooooh.
[02-Jul-2015 01:45:46]  <Calica> IllFlower: Hmm....
[02-Jul-2015 01:48:07]  <Rig> What would be Ayako's motivation?
[02-Jul-2015 01:48:19]  <Rig> Just revenge or belief that he's the culprit?
[02-Jul-2015 01:49:06]  <BGTB2005> maybe we could try and get Naoki to surrender, claim we're temporarily detaining him to protect him from possible retaliation from anyone that would target him for whatever reason??
[02-Jul-2015 01:49:11]  <IllFlower> The latter would make more sense, but I dunno if she buys it.
[02-Jul-2015 01:49:33]  <BGTB2005> Rin believes he's guilty, but she doesn't exactly have much proof
[02-Jul-2015 01:50:18]  <Calica> Maybe Ayako should follow Kazuki and let Rin and Hikari battle Naoki, thus leaving the witchiness as a weird thing that barely came up :p
[02-Jul-2015 01:50:19]  <Icon> Hikari's not convinced of his being out of the clear, for certain.
[02-Jul-2015 01:50:47]  <IllFlower> I think it would make more sense for the one who's actually got witchbrain to do the unreasonable things.
[02-Jul-2015 01:51:00]  <BGTB2005> i for one would like to see more witchiness out of ayako :V
[02-Jul-2015 01:52:01]  <Rig> I wouldn't say no to witchiness. It'd be an interesting thing that we haven't seen a lot of.
[02-Jul-2015 01:52:47]  <Icon> At the very least it forces them to react which is fun
[02-Jul-2015 01:52:51]  <Icon> And also dangerous.
[02-Jul-2015 01:53:05]  <BGTB2005> rin lives for danger

[02-Jul-2015 01:55:18]  <IllFlower> Calica?
[02-Jul-2015 01:55:51]  <Calica> Sorry, I'm still not sure how to make it make sense
[02-Jul-2015 01:57:00]  <BGTB2005> have the witch jump to conclusions and bring Ayako along for the ride?
[02-Jul-2015 01:57:22]  <IllFlower> Well, if it's primal, it might just be "I don't believe you SO FUCK YOU I'M BRINGING THE PAIN"
[02-Jul-2015 01:58:58]  <Calica> Although nobody notices it (least of all Ayako), a bizarre white smoke has begun to form around Ayako's hands.
[02-Jul-2015 01:59:38]  <IllFlower> THEY ELECTED A NEW POPE
[02-Jul-2015 01:59:43]  <BGTB2005> pffff
[02-Jul-2015 01:59:52]  <Rig> Hahaha
[02-Jul-2015 02:00:14]  <Calica> IllFlower: I think what you're supposed to say is "Habemus papam"
[02-Jul-2015 02:00:32]  <Rig> Bless you.
[02-Jul-2015 02:00:51]  <Buttercupistiny> i will throw holy water at all of you
[02-Jul-2015 02:00:55]  <IllFlower> (Ayako leaps on the table, screaming with fury. "DOOON'T FUUUUUUCK WITH MEEEEE")
[02-Jul-2015 02:02:32]  <IllFlower> Are we magicking? I love it when we magic.
[02-Jul-2015 02:02:47]  <Rig> Mostly because it means people die.
[02-Jul-2015 02:02:54]  <BGTB2005> so what're we magicking for?
[02-Jul-2015 02:02:56]  <IllFlower> I NEVER SAID THAT
[02-Jul-2015 02:03:21]  <Rig> It was heavily implied.
[02-Jul-2015 02:03:39]  <Calica> Ayako then runs toward Naoki and begins to swing an arm...
[02-Jul-2015 02:03:48]  <BGTB2005> magicking is fun; it leads to delicious despair
[02-Jul-2015 02:05:25]  <Calica> do any of the other girls want to stop her?
[02-Jul-2015 02:05:31]  <Calica> (or Kazuki >_>)
[02-Jul-2015 02:05:42]  <IllFlower> That's conflict!
[02-Jul-2015 02:06:01]  <Icon> Hikari would, absolutely.
[02-Jul-2015 02:06:03]  <Rig> Kazuki is dramatically leaving and hoping you aren't punching the guy.
[02-Jul-2015 02:06:33]  <BGTB2005> stakes are stopping Ayako from beating up Naoki (at least until we confirm he's the culprit)?
[02-Jul-2015 02:07:17]  <Rig> So, is this a Hikari/Ayako conflict?
[02-Jul-2015 02:07:33]  <BGTB2005> Rin will take part, though she probably shouldn't
[02-Jul-2015 02:08:25]  <IllFlower> Wait, doesn't Naoki get a say in not getting punched?
[02-Jul-2015 02:08:49]  <BGTB2005> if he's fast enough to react :V
[02-Jul-2015 02:09:15]  <Icon> lol.
[02-Jul-2015 02:09:25]  <IllFlower> I'm still not sure what the stakes are. Is witchy Ayako trying to beat a confession out of him?
[02-Jul-2015 02:09:38]  <Calica> IllFlower: Something like that, yes.  I don't think witchy Ayako fully understands herself.
[02-Jul-2015 02:09:50]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but we have to.
[02-Jul-2015 02:09:53]  <BGTB2005> i dont think anyone understands witchy ayako
[02-Jul-2015 02:10:16]  <IllFlower> We're the players, we must understand that which our characters don't sometimes.
[02-Jul-2015 02:10:44]  <IllFlower> I'm trying to think of effective stakes for Naoki that aren't just "don't get maimed."
[02-Jul-2015 02:10:49]  <Rig> I dunno if it'd be so much of "beat a confession out of him" as much as "make him pay"
[02-Jul-2015 02:11:08]  <Icon> Ayako is slowly becoming more Rin-like in firearm pole-vaulting, for sure
[02-Jul-2015 02:11:16]  <Calica> IllFlower: That's part of why I was trying to get the other conservators involved
[02-Jul-2015 02:11:32]  <Calica> Icon: yeah this was probably going to be Ayako's last arc even if it weren't going to be the game's
[02-Jul-2015 02:11:36]  <IllFlower> Well, if you anger him enough, he'll want to send a message by delicately mincing Ayako.
[02-Jul-2015 02:12:14]  <IllFlower> Yeah, fuck it, let's go with that. Roll your dice.
[02-Jul-2015 02:12:31]  <Icon> I can only assume we're doing this live.
[02-Jul-2015 02:12:33]  <Rig> Should Kazuki be rolled up in this?
[02-Jul-2015 02:12:45]  <IllFlower> Are we punchin'?
[02-Jul-2015 02:12:50]  <IllFlower> Rig: Is he punchin'?
[02-Jul-2015 02:13:02]  <Rig> It's kind of hard to not notice witchy magic shit.
[02-Jul-2015 02:13:08]  <Rig> He'd want to stop Ayako.
[02-Jul-2015 02:13:28]  <IllFlower> Even if it means he gets pwned?
[02-Jul-2015 02:13:51]  <Rig> He'd probably not be that invested.
[02-Jul-2015 02:13:52]  <Calica> IllFlower: Ac+Wl I assume?
[02-Jul-2015 02:14:12]  <BGTB2005> we magicking?
[02-Jul-2015 02:14:29]  <Rig> Kazuki is staying out.
[02-Jul-2015 02:14:29]  <IllFlower> Calica: Starting at magic?
[02-Jul-2015 02:14:43]  <IllFlower> From the description it sounded like hand-to-hand but if you want magic you get magic.
[02-Jul-2015 02:15:18]  <Calica> IllFlower: Hmm, yeah, then we're punching.  (I'm a bit rusty)
[02-Jul-2015 02:15:30]  <Calica> which is...bd+wl?
[02-Jul-2015 02:15:35]  <IllFlower> I mean, if you want magical punching that's fine with me.
[02-Jul-2015 02:15:40]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[02-Jul-2015 02:15:57]  <IllFlower> And if you're witchbraining might as well roll the demonic influence.
[02-Jul-2015 02:15:59]  <Calica> I mean, her hands are currently covered in witchy smoke, so
[02-Jul-2015 02:16:13]  <Calica> demonic influence is 5d10 right?

[02-Jul-2015 02:35:19]  <IllFlower> I don't think we've had this kind of crazy dice imbalance since the first or second arc.
[02-Jul-2015 02:35:48]  <Rig> Kazuki wouldn't be much help here anyway. Though it would give him a reason to actually use his costume for the first time.
[02-Jul-2015 02:35:52]  <Icon> I'm considering what to do, hence the slowness of my response. Like, Hikari obviously wants to pull Ayako back from the brink if at all possible, so her immediate response would be to stop her... but she's also getting attacked by this dude.
[02-Jul-2015 02:36:06]  <BGTB2005> Rin runs towards Ayako and Naoki, putting herself between the two
[02-Jul-2015 02:36:09]  <Calica> well the room just got cut off
[02-Jul-2015 02:36:28]  <Rig> I think the appropriate response would be to start blowing up everything.
[02-Jul-2015 02:37:07]  <Icon> I kind of want Hikari to try subduing Ayako, but haha yeah Rin can definitely take this guy on.
[02-Jul-2015 02:37:09]  <IllFlower> Try to restrain her. It's simple enough.
[02-Jul-2015 02:37:20]  <Icon> Mmmm. Moment, pls.
[02-Jul-2015 02:37:31]  <BGTB2005> it's what Hikari's been wanting to do for a while, isn't it?
[02-Jul-2015 02:37:39]  <Icon> Pfft.
[02-Jul-2015 02:38:05]  <BGTB2005> also not sure what dice I should add to my pool before raising
[02-Jul-2015 02:38:27]  <IllFlower> Helping people without violence.
[02-Jul-2015 02:38:40]  <IllFlower> Also the relationship with Ayako.
[02-Jul-2015 02:39:00]  <IllFlower> Icon: You need to roll your relationship with Ayako too. 3d8.
[02-Jul-2015 02:39:10]  <Icon> @dice add 3d8
[02-Jul-2015 02:39:10]  <Omnipresence> 14Icon: Rolled 1 7 8 = 16. Bank now has 1 2 3 3 5 5 5 5 6 6 7 8 = 56.

[02-Jul-2015 02:39:30]  <BGTB2005> woohoo
[02-Jul-2015 02:39:35]  <IllFlower> Icon: Plus this seems pretty clearly "my allies are me responsibility." But raise first.
[02-Jul-2015 02:39:36]  * BGTB2005 looks at Icon's roll
[02-Jul-2015 02:40:03]  <BGTB2005> paruparuparuparu
[02-Jul-2015 02:40:54]  <Icon> Hikari shouts Ayako's name in vain, before tackling her into the wall. "Ayako, listen to me, please you have to stop!" She shouts, even if they're clearly past the point of words.
[02-Jul-2015 02:41:00]  <Icon> @dice use 5 6

[02-Jul-2015 02:41:45]  <Icon> IllFlower: Yeah, so can I roll that now?
[02-Jul-2015 02:42:02]  <IllFlower> Oh, I meant after you describe the raise, btu before you put up dice.
[02-Jul-2015 02:42:04]  <BGTB2005> since they're past the point of words I'm not sure if that high a raise is exactly justified?
[02-Jul-2015 02:42:14]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: tackle
[02-Jul-2015 02:42:40]  <Icon> IllFlower: Oop. :V
[02-Jul-2015 02:42:47]  <Calica> BGTB2005: actually Vince Baker has said that it's okay to use words in a later thing, you should just be able to justify them as words that will be heard, metaphorically, over the gunfire
[02-Jul-2015 02:43:31]  <BGTB2005> ah
[02-Jul-2015 02:43:46]  <Calica> It's moot in this case, though, since Hikari's attempting to tackle Ayako
[02-Jul-2015 02:44:00]  <IllFlower> Icon: Are you adding in the new dice?

[02-Jul-2015 02:44:47]  <Icon> IllFlower: Yeah, that bad?
[02-Jul-2015 02:44:58]  <IllFlower> Icon: 'Sfine.
[02-Jul-2015 02:45:26]  <Icon> Okay. And yeah, when I can actually RP or know what to say, I was just thinking "do you expect her not to talk anyway?"
[02-Jul-2015 02:45:37]  <Calica> talky fights are a-ok in my book anyways
[02-Jul-2015 02:45:44]  <Calica> like, talking while fighting
[02-Jul-2015 02:45:49]  <Icon> Same.
[02-Jul-2015 02:45:59]  <IllFlower> That's basically what magical girl fights are anyway.

[02-Jul-2015 02:49:58]  <Calica> Ayako gets knocked off balance and disoriented by Hikari's blow.
[02-Jul-2015 02:49:58]  <BGTB2005> Rin lunges at Naoki, aiming to keep him held down.
[02-Jul-2015 02:50:00]  <Rig> Kazuki believes his teammates can totally handle this. He's also not in denial.
[02-Jul-2015 02:50:45]  <Calica> When her eyes open, they glow faintly, and seem to pierce with their glare.
[02-Jul-2015 02:50:50]  <Calica> "He's corrupted.  He's dangerous."

[02-Jul-2015 02:56:00]  <Icon> lol.
[02-Jul-2015 02:56:09]  <IllFlower> Miyama ducks underneath Rin, letting her fly harmlessly overhead.

[02-Jul-2015 02:56:42]  <Icon> Now imagining Rin actually flying, and then floating in the air angrily with her wings
[02-Jul-2015 02:56:58]  <IllFlower> So... I'm thinking "fuck subtlety, let's go magic."
[02-Jul-2015 02:57:05]  <BGTB2005> I was sorta expecting him to do the witchy-smoke thing
[02-Jul-2015 02:57:51]  <IllFlower> Anyone with objections?
[02-Jul-2015 02:57:56]  * BGTB2005 checks sheet
[02-Jul-2015 02:57:58]  <IllFlower> Sane people?
[02-Jul-2015 02:58:13]  <BGTB2005> this is going to be fun...
[02-Jul-2015 02:58:15]  <Rig> I object, but only because I have no idea how to handle everyone being dead.
[02-Jul-2015 02:58:34]  <Icon> Hikari will do her best. o7
[02-Jul-2015 02:58:56]  <Calica> Ayako will also do her best (to go completely nuts on Miyama)
[02-Jul-2015 02:59:39]  <BGTB2005> Rin will do her best (to not die and gain everyone's approval)
[02-Jul-2015 03:01:17]  <IllFlower> Then again, I don't think it really makes sense.
[02-Jul-2015 03:01:56]  <IllFlower> Miyama turns his attention from Rin back to Ayako. Looks like witch radar.
[02-Jul-2015 03:02:33]  <IllFlower> He swings his leg for a kick at Ayako's crumpled form.

[02-Jul-2015 03:04:05]  <BGTB2005> would hikari trying to push Naoki off balance work as an assist?
[02-Jul-2015 03:04:49]  <Icon> Or just taking the brunt of it in her place.
[02-Jul-2015 03:05:21]  <Icon> Unless there are better ideas, heh.
[02-Jul-2015 03:05:33]  <Calica> Ayako could transform (costume)
[02-Jul-2015 03:06:14]  <IllFlower> She could just magic it all and call it a day.
[02-Jul-2015 03:06:42]  <Calica> she could
[02-Jul-2015 03:07:40]  <Icon> So she's willing to take Hikari down too for getting in the way, eh?
[02-Jul-2015 03:08:28]  <BGTB2005> Ayako's in witch mode but we're hoping not
[02-Jul-2015 03:09:05]  <SehaLee> Dark Heresy?
[02-Jul-2015 03:09:11]  <Calica> A blue glow appears on Ayako's body as she raises an arm to block Miyama's kick.  The glow quickly recedes with Ayako in her costume, protection runes glowing even more eerily than usual.

[02-Jul-2015 03:14:46]  <BGTB2005> I think this is the first time Ayako's actually run /towards/ violence?
[02-Jul-2015 03:16:23]  <Calica> Ayako opens her hand, still glowing; her fingers seem elongated, almost like claws.  Hikari is still in the way, but whatever Ayako is still in control keeps her hands from touching Hikari as it slashes towards Miyama

[02-Jul-2015 03:41:27]  <Rig> It'd be a very active defense.

[02-Jul-2015 04:38:30]  <BGTB2005> Icon: well then. I was thinking that Rin would summon her wings and make a sort of 'tent' with them to shield herself and the others from Miyama's attack
[02-Jul-2015 04:38:37]  <Icon> I mean, Rig's commented at times even after he's exited.
[02-Jul-2015 04:38:53]  <BGTB2005> but that works too I guess
[02-Jul-2015 04:39:07]  <Icon> Whatever you want, you're risking your life either way. :p
[02-Jul-2015 04:39:20]  <IllFlower> Kazuki: "I have to wait 24 hours before I can grow new crops? This is a rip-off!"
[02-Jul-2015 04:39:34]  <Rig> Basically
[02-Jul-2015 04:40:33]  <IllFlower> "I'm going to angrily tweet about this! #fuckeverything"
[02-Jul-2015 04:40:34]  <BGTB2005> I probably wouldn't get to use Hikari's relationship dice after she was part of the conflict and folded, but whatever
[02-Jul-2015 04:41:02]  <Calica> "I think one of my fellow Conservators is basically killing herself right now #fml"
[02-Jul-2015 04:41:42]  <Rig> "Locked out of fighting a demon. #emgirlprobs"
[02-Jul-2015 04:42:11]  <Icon> "Even the sane one is trapped there. #gdi #canthavenicethings"

[02-Jul-2015 04:43:11]  <Calica> anyways, is it still BGTB2005's see/
[02-Jul-2015 04:43:13]  <Calica> ?
[02-Jul-2015 04:43:15]  <IllFlower> Yes.
[02-Jul-2015 04:43:19]  <IllFlower> What's the plan?
[02-Jul-2015 04:44:09]  <Calica> I think Rin wants to summon her wings as a shield
[02-Jul-2015 04:44:12]  <BGTB2005> still thinking of going with the wing-tent, but trying to decide between having Rin protect herself or the other two as well
[02-Jul-2015 04:44:22]  <Calica> BGTB2005: you don't need to protect the other two, Hikari's goti t
[02-Jul-2015 04:44:29]  <IllFlower> The other two are, mechanically speaking, fine.
[02-Jul-2015 04:44:41]  <Rig> However, Rin is dead.
[02-Jul-2015 04:44:43]  <Rig> Long live Rin.
[02-Jul-2015 04:44:54]  <Icon> Hikari can take care of things. Hikari's got this.
[02-Jul-2015 04:44:58]  <BGTB2005> for flavour reasons, though
[02-Jul-2015 04:44:58]  <IllFlower> 万岁万岁万万岁
[02-Jul-2015 04:45:01]  <Calica> rin has 3d10 fallout already
[02-Jul-2015 04:45:15]  <Calica> BGTB2005: hikari's protecting ayako color-wise
[02-Jul-2015 04:46:00]  <Calica> IllFlower: long live, long live, long long live?
[02-Jul-2015 04:46:28]  <BGTB2005> Summoning her wings, Rin crouches and wraps them around herself to protect herself from the blizzard

[02-Jul-2015 04:48:05]  <IllFlower> 1d10 death
[02-Jul-2015 04:48:26]  <IllFlower> You'd have to have a hell of a justification for making a new relationship now.

[02-Jul-2015 04:48:51]  <IllFlower> Except death. 1d10 death is always an option. If you die.
[02-Jul-2015 04:49:12]  <Rig> Jun.
[02-Jul-2015 04:49:14]  <IllFlower> That's right, I've given up on trying to convince you crazy diamonds not to die.
[02-Jul-2015 04:49:15]  <Rig> Jun is an option.

[02-Jul-2015 04:49:57]  <Icon> But yeah just do something flashy to ward off the danger, imo.

[02-Jul-2015 04:54:24]  <Icon> Explosive fire.
[02-Jul-2015 04:55:07]  <IllFlower> I keep bringing up Set Fire to Flames during these conflicts and it's becoming less and less of a joke...
[02-Jul-2015 04:55:41]  <Calica> well, rin might die soon, so that might be over
[02-Jul-2015 04:56:43]  <BGTB2005> With the blizzard dying down, Rin unfurls her wings. Aiming her cannon, she unleashes a mass of fire to saturate Naoki and the area around him in flame.

[02-Jul-2015 05:05:08]  <BGTB2005> I'm trying to figure out how to use Rin's transformation to her costume to help her, if it would even be feasible
[02-Jul-2015 05:06:04]  <Calica> your transformation has protective power, yeah

[02-Jul-2015 05:21:21]  <BGTB2005> Long term I guess minus one to WL, for burnout and such?

[02-Jul-2015 05:23:49]  <IllFlower> It's pretty beat up by now. Also witchy.
[02-Jul-2015 05:23:52]  <Calica> and for the XP...maybe a relationship with Hikari?  Surprised that never happened
[02-Jul-2015 05:24:38]  <IllFlower> Shipped.

[02-Jul-2015 05:30:07]  <IllFlower> He looks at Ayako. "And you have some very interesting partners."

[02-Jul-2015 05:32:20]  <Rig> Yeah, trying to come up with something. Kazuki jumps in and starts another conflict.

[02-Jul-2015 05:35:36]  <Rig> "What the hell happened?" Kazuki says, trying not to shout.
[02-Jul-2015 05:35:44]  <Icon> Someone has to want to not kill someone!
[02-Jul-2015 05:36:29]  <IllFlower> "It seemed to me like some extrajudicial enforcement."
[02-Jul-2015 05:37:02]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@CPEbc4dfb91a083-CMbc4dfb91a080.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)

[02-Jul-2015 05:37:55]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at Ayako and then back to Miyama.
[02-Jul-2015 05:38:07]  <Rig> What does the person with no context for this say...
[02-Jul-2015 05:38:25]  <Icon> Hikari sighs, then frowns. "Ayako attacked Miyama, who responded in turn. Rin got involved too, before..." she trails off. Surely Kazuki of all people can piece it together.
[02-Jul-2015 05:38:26]  <BGTB2005> "You had those initiates killed." Rin keeps her cannon pointed in Naoki's direction, her exhaustion clear in how much it's shaking. "You tried to kill my big sister. I couldn't let you leave."
[02-Jul-2015 05:39:17]  <Rig> How does one exactly arrest a Prophet and take him 2 hours away?
[02-Jul-2015 05:39:49]  <IllFlower> "I can't say this is the first time someone's threatened my life, though every time I hope that it's the last."
[02-Jul-2015 05:40:03]  <Rig> Super emo.
[02-Jul-2015 05:40:21]  <IllFlower> hwha
[02-Jul-2015 05:40:32]  <BGTB2005> (Rin: "And if I had the chance I would've made sure it was the last.")
[02-Jul-2015 05:41:13]  <Rig> I honestly have no idea what to do. We've been at this for 7 hours.
[02-Jul-2015 05:41:23]  <IllFlower> Miyama backs towards the exterior door opposite where the Conservators first entered.
[02-Jul-2015 05:42:04]  <IllFlower> "Under any other circumstances, I would be perfectly justified in taking you down in self-defense.
[02-Jul-2015 05:42:52]  <IllFlower> "You're not the third soul, though. And so in this case, I must pass on the provocation."
[02-Jul-2015 05:43:59]  <Calica> Ayako seems to mumble something in her unconscious state: "Three souls make one wish?"
[02-Jul-2015 05:44:01]  <Icon> (Third soul?)
[02-Jul-2015 05:44:16]  <IllFlower> He slides the door open behind him. "Good night."
[02-Jul-2015 05:44:24]  <BGTB2005> I think Hikari's the only fully awake person who would understand the full significance?
[02-Jul-2015 05:44:42]  <IllFlower> And almost immediately, his figure seems to vanish into the darkened mountain terrain.
[02-Jul-2015 05:44:53]  <Rig> Kazuki stares after him for a moment.
[02-Jul-2015 05:45:07]  <Rig> (Wasn't his stake escaping and he lost, he can't escape)
[02-Jul-2015 05:45:33]  <IllFlower> Is anyone keen on stopping him?
[02-Jul-2015 05:45:44]  <BGTB2005> would this be another conflict?
[02-Jul-2015 05:45:47]  <Rig> Kazuki could try, but he'd die.
[02-Jul-2015 05:45:48]  <IllFlower> No.
[02-Jul-2015 05:45:52]  <BGTB2005> either way
[02-Jul-2015 05:46:04]  <Calica> Ayako would probably be but
[02-Jul-2015 05:46:09]  <BGTB2005> Watching Naoki leave, Rin starts to chase after
[02-Jul-2015 05:46:29]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@CPEbc4dfb91a083-CMbc4dfb91a080.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[02-Jul-2015 05:46:30]  <Rig> Kazuki sighs and turns to see if Ayako is all right.
[02-Jul-2015 05:46:46]  <IllFlower> I judged that everyone was too worn out to pursue him, but if that's not the case...
[02-Jul-2015 05:46:53]  <IllFlower> We're not doing another conflict, though.
[02-Jul-2015 05:47:24]  <BGTB2005> Rin's pretty much just fueled by her concern for her big sister by this point
[02-Jul-2015 05:48:07]  <Icon> Hikari takes a deep breath, and leans Ayako against the wall, properly inspecting her this time. "Damn it..." she mutters, failing to keep her anger in check.
[02-Jul-2015 05:48:25]  <Icon> (Well, Hikari would be, if we hadn't failed and if we were more able.)
[02-Jul-2015 05:49:14]  <IllFlower> Someone should really pick up on Ayako's hint.
[02-Jul-2015 05:49:15]  <BGTB2005> I think it's reasonable to believe Rin's heard of the three-souls cult, and though she doesn't know the full details she'd be able to connect the dots?
[02-Jul-2015 05:50:11]  <Icon> "Kazuki, are you familiar with the three souls cult, by any chance?"
[02-Jul-2015 05:51:04]  <Rig> Hahaha, I as a player know nothing about it, so I'd basically be trying to read the logs.
[02-Jul-2015 05:51:20]  <IllFlower> ("Yes, I feel that... in a previous life... it killed me...")
[02-Jul-2015 05:51:37]  <Rig> "I've heard of it, but I don't know much about it."
[02-Jul-2015 05:51:55]  <Rig> "Are you saying Miyama was a member of the cult?"
[02-Jul-2015 05:52:15]  <Icon> (Just to double check, without getting into all of the people's names who I forget, it was three dead folks = wish, yes?)
[02-Jul-2015 05:52:26]  <Calica> that was the idea, yeah
[02-Jul-2015 05:52:33]  <BGTB2005> something like that, i think
[02-Jul-2015 05:53:33]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@CPEbc4dfb91a083-CMbc4dfb91a080.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[02-Jul-2015 05:53:35]  <Icon> "When someone as suspicious as Miyama makes a comment about the third soul like that, then yes."
[02-Jul-2015 05:54:04]  <BGTB2005> ("Now go make sure Rin doesn't get herself killed.")
[02-Jul-2015 05:54:19]  <Rig> "What was the cult about? He's trying to kill 3 people and that's it?"
[02-Jul-2015 05:54:39]  <BGTB2005> Hikari can probably explain later?
[02-Jul-2015 05:54:55]  <BGTB2005> or Ayako if she's awake by then?
[02-Jul-2015 05:54:57]  <Icon> (I'm up for it?)
[02-Jul-2015 05:55:34]  <IllFlower> Hm, I wonder what he's wishing for...
[02-Jul-2015 05:55:44]  <Calica> the revival of his daughter, i think
[02-Jul-2015 05:55:51]  <Icon> "I - or Ayako - can explain that to you on the way, Kazuki." She stands up, thankful that Ayako isn't too bruised up. "We should just be going, now."
[02-Jul-2015 05:56:28]  <Rig> "Where the hell is Rin going?"
[02-Jul-2015 05:57:43]  <IllFlower> I thought wishes couldn't affect magical beings? Hm, magic is weird.
[02-Jul-2015 05:58:03]  <BGTB2005> are they still magical hen they're dead?
[02-Jul-2015 05:58:06]  <BGTB2005> *when
[02-Jul-2015 05:59:00]  <Rig> Her magic was taken away.
[02-Jul-2015 05:59:22]  <Icon> "Trying to catch him. We can meet her on the way, he's already far gone by now."
[02-Jul-2015 05:59:56]  <Icon> Hikari carries Ayako to the door and proceeds on her way, expecting Kazuki to follow.
[02-Jul-2015 06:00:04]  *** Lin_Chong <~Kevin@182.55.189.100> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[02-Jul-2015 06:00:56]  <Rig> Kazuki does what seems so hard for everyone else and follows Hikari.
[02-Jul-2015 06:01:05]  <IllFlower> Some of this doesn't quite fit together, but the only answers are even less palatable...
[02-Jul-2015 06:01:30]  <Rig> I don't think I'm capable to tying together plot threads at this point.
[02-Jul-2015 06:01:38]  <IllFlower> I'm going to assume they catch up with a panting Rin at the bottom of the hill.
[02-Jul-2015 06:01:48]  <Icon> Yeah.
[02-Jul-2015 06:02:18]  <Icon> "Rin, give up, he's already escaped." Hikari calls out.
[02-Jul-2015 06:02:34]  <BGTB2005> she has her wings so she probably glided down, but I imagine she's pretty exhausted
[02-Jul-2015 06:03:46]  <IllFlower> Seems like we're ending on an ominous note.
[02-Jul-2015 06:04:07]  <Rig> Always a good ending
[02-Jul-2015 06:04:15]  <IllFlower> Positively diabolical, really.
[02-Jul-2015 06:04:53]  <BGTB2005> "No." Taking a moment to catch her breath, she continues, "'The third soul', I don't know what that means but I think it has something to do with my big sis. I think he's still trying to hurt Chiaki."
[02-Jul-2015 06:05:00]  <IllFlower> Anyone want to say any foreboding last words before the season ends?
[02-Jul-2015 06:05:20]  <Calica> I don't have anything
[02-Jul-2015 06:05:30]  <Rig> Nothing meaningful
[02-Jul-2015 06:05:42]  <BGTB2005> Are Rin's last lines foreboding enough?
[02-Jul-2015 06:05:46]  <Icon> "I'm not telling you to stop. I'm telling you to listen to me and pull yourself in unless you also want to end up like this." She motions to Ayako. "Except having failed." There are hints of anger in her voice.
[02-Jul-2015 06:05:48]  <IllFlower> But, like, dramatic??
[02-Jul-2015 06:07:40]  * Rig thinks about it for a little.
[02-Jul-2015 06:08:05]  <IllFlower> I mean, there's a good thing going now about talking down Rin.
[02-Jul-2015 06:08:11]  <IllFlower> But then after that something dramatic.
[02-Jul-2015 06:08:45]  <Rig> I've got something dramatic, I guess.
[02-Jul-2015 06:09:25]  <IllFlower> ("What do you mean, 'except'? We *have* failed.")
[02-Jul-2015 06:09:26]  <Rig> "Rin, there isn't anything we can do now. We've just got to get back home. We can't protect anyone from here."
[02-Jul-2015 06:10:32]  <Rig> Kazuki looks toward the train station. "Maybe we can't really protect anyone."
[02-Jul-2015 06:10:40]  <Rig> (Sad dramatic music plays)
[02-Jul-2015 06:10:51]  <Calica> we protected, uh
[02-Jul-2015 06:10:54]  <IllFlower> Shit, that's pretty dramatic.
[02-Jul-2015 06:10:54]  <Calica> yumiko?
[02-Jul-2015 06:10:56]  <BGTB2005> "He got away..." Rin falls to her knees, tears streaming down her face.
[02-Jul-2015 06:11:20]  <Icon> Hikari mutters something under her breath in response to Kazuki's remark, before walking towards the station.
[02-Jul-2015 06:11:24]  <Rig> I don't think we've successfully solved a case with Kazuki here. He's pretty downtrodden.
[02-Jul-2015 06:11:26]  <Calica> Ayako slowly wakes up.
[02-Jul-2015 06:11:27]  <IllFlower> Whoa, Rin has tear ducts?
[02-Jul-2015 06:11:34]  <Calica> "...I'm corrupted, aren't I?"
[02-Jul-2015 06:11:38]  <Icon> (BGTB typed quicker so imagine this came before her crying.)
[02-Jul-2015 06:11:51]  <IllFlower> Wait, I didn't mean everyone needed to be dramatic at once!
[02-Jul-2015 06:11:58]  <IllFlower> Now it just seems kinda silly!
[02-Jul-2015 06:12:00]  <Rig> You put so much pressure on us.
[02-Jul-2015 06:12:14]  <Nitya> you probably shouldn't have started a madoka magica/cheka crossover, then
[02-Jul-2015 06:12:16]  <Calica> I was considering whether to push that to next session or not
[02-Jul-2015 06:12:17]  <Icon> Man I was gonna respond to Kazuki regardless.
[02-Jul-2015 06:12:48]  <Icon> Calica: We can retcon? :p
[02-Jul-2015 06:13:33]  <IllFlower> Nitya: Bolshevik Madoka? I think I read a fanfic like that once.
[02-Jul-2015 06:13:50]  <Rig> Are we wrapping?
[02-Jul-2015 06:13:55]  <Calica> i think so?
[02-Jul-2015 06:13:58]  <Icon> Yah.
[02-Jul-2015 06:13:59]  <IllFlower> Sad piano music.
[02-Jul-2015 06:14:12]  <Rig> Bruce Banner walks away, hitching for a ride.
[02-Jul-2015 06:14:34]  <BGTB2005> A final wrap-up session next?
[02-Jul-2015 06:14:52]  <IllFlower> Thanks for sticking around, everyone. We'll be back with emdogs season 2 once we're rolling in money from merchandise sales. Look for a Rin figma coming to a store near you!
[02-Jul-2015 06:15:07]  <Rig> It's also a lighter!
[02-Jul-2015 06:15:10]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[02-Jul-2015 06:15:20]  <Rig> Thanks for running the session, IllFlower.
[02-Jul-2015 06:15:21]  <Icon> But, but, what about the Hikari dolls
[02-Jul-2015 06:15:36]  <Rig> I look forward to season 2's timeskip.
[02-Jul-2015 06:15:38]  <Icon> Or Hikari anything.
[02-Jul-2015 06:15:50]  <Rig> Where the Order has fallen and been replaced by a cult.
