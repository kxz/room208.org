[09-Aug-2013 00:30:28]  <IllFlower> Right, so given our lack of anywhere better to do this, we're going to briefly take over the channel to do a test character creation run for that "magical Dogs" setting. Any objections?
[09-Aug-2013 00:30:29]  <Barcode> oh, right. the rules. fuckin'...
[09-Aug-2013 00:30:37]  <Barcode> got em.

[09-Aug-2013 00:30:48]  <Rig> All good here.
[09-Aug-2013 00:31:25]  <Barcode> none here, says the third player rather than bystander
[09-Aug-2013 00:31:32]  <IllFlower> I meant from people who weren't involright ponicalica owns this channel anyway.

[09-Aug-2013 00:34:39]  <Barcode> bold new services
[09-Aug-2013 00:34:49]  <IllFlower> Nice to see the site actually works again, incidentally.
[09-Aug-2013 00:35:03]  <Rig> Okay, so what's the first thing?
[09-Aug-2013 00:35:29]  <Barcode> we gotta make chars.
[09-Aug-2013 00:35:33]  <IllFlower> Let's just hop to the manual, page 22...
[09-Aug-2013 00:36:11]  <IllFlower> You're all going to need to pick a background, for starters.
[09-Aug-2013 00:36:30]  <Rig> I was thinking a complicated history for my character.
[09-Aug-2013 00:36:46]  <ponicalica> since even with nu!Sumire I didn't know which background to pick, I'm probably going to randomly pick whatever Rig and Code don't
[09-Aug-2013 00:36:48]  <Barcode> Thought we'd have to figure out what kjinds of characters we wanted ot play before picking backgrounds. <_<
[09-Aug-2013 00:36:56]  <Barcode> but uh, let's see.
[09-Aug-2013 00:37:02]  <ponicalica> well background sort of is which kjind of character to play
[09-Aug-2013 00:37:31]  <ponicalica> 17:31:28 <@Fiora> ponicalica: you're both cuties fyi <---also btw fiora u r delusional
[09-Aug-2013 00:37:53]  <Rig> Well, I think Complicated History works well for my character idea. I want to play an emdoggirl that dealt with some kind of tragic loss.
[09-Aug-2013 00:38:30]  <IllFlower> Okay, go ahead with that.
[09-Aug-2013 00:38:46]  <Barcode> should we be using the pad's commentary for commentary orrrrr
[09-Aug-2013 00:38:54]  <ponicalica> i dun even know
[09-Aug-2013 00:39:20]  <Barcode> I was liking the idea of an ex-juvie-gang emgirl in the hour or so before I showed up.
[09-Aug-2013 00:39:20]  <Fiora> sorry poni
[09-Aug-2013 00:39:31]  <Barcode> Which would be Complicated Community. Dunno if that'd be too similar.
[09-Aug-2013 00:39:58]  <Rig> I don't think that's much like my idea.
[09-Aug-2013 00:40:32]  <Barcode> It's not, but it'll basically leave ponicalica to be our bastion of order.
[09-Aug-2013 00:40:48]  <ponicalica> and do we really want that ;p
[09-Aug-2013 00:41:00]  <Rig> Well, it's not like complicated means broken.
[09-Aug-2013 00:41:10]  <Barcode> I could also play the hardcase if you wanna do someone more emotional.
[09-Aug-2013 00:41:38]  <Rig> Dunno, really. I'm flexible.
[09-Aug-2013 00:42:02]  <Barcode> Well like, what kinda personality were you thinking?
[09-Aug-2013 00:42:08]  <IllFlower> I dunno, I could see ponicalica being the straight arrow.
[09-Aug-2013 00:42:33]  <Rig> I was thinking some kind of magical girl that doesn't want people to get hurt because of her losses.
[09-Aug-2013 00:42:54]  <Rig> So, she became a fixer because she wants to prevent other people from being witchified.
[09-Aug-2013 00:42:56]  <ponicalica> heh, well, I could probably still find emotion in the hardcase, I'd just have to tread the line between letting my character not be completely boring and not having the entire party go off the rails :p
[09-Aug-2013 00:43:11]  <IllFlower> Barcode: IRC is easier, we can talk here and then commit stuff to the pad.
[09-Aug-2013 00:43:15]  <Barcode> m.
[09-Aug-2013 00:44:17]  <Barcode> hmhmhm. the ex-ganger i was thinking of playing would be someone who would kind of be a bit loose with her responsibilities. Someone who takes advantage of her position as an emgirl, and gets by via getting the job done regardless.
[09-Aug-2013 00:44:52]  <Rig> Sounds interesting.
[09-Aug-2013 00:45:06]  <Barcode> More suited to intimidating people into behaving and beating those who aren't convinced, than hearing everyone out.
[09-Aug-2013 00:45:49]  <Barcode> This is, of course, assuming ponny wants to be Good Cop.
[09-Aug-2013 00:45:54]  <ponicalica> I think I might do Strong History and then have someone who tries to keep things stable because he/she knows("knows", """knows""", knows vs knows, academically vs practically maybe, but knows) that instability = witchification
[09-Aug-2013 00:46:03]  <Barcode> I like it.
[09-Aug-2013 00:46:10]  <ponicalica> but not yet confident in that enough to commit it to piratepad
[09-Aug-2013 00:46:17]  <Barcode> Pff. You can delete stuff on the pad!
[09-Aug-2013 00:46:36]  <Barcode> The stoic character I had in mind was basically that, though more willing to shake things up as long as she's still the Single Point of Reference.
[09-Aug-2013 00:46:59]  <ponicalica> I can delete o the pad but the way IllFlower describes it I dunno if I wanna commit quite yet
[09-Aug-2013 00:47:23]  <Barcode> let's see how many PR references i can slip under the mat
[09-Aug-2013 00:47:50]  <IllFlower> Okay, so in essence we'd have Rig with a shattered history, Barcode as perhaps a bit of a loose cannon, and ponicalica as one who values order above all?
[09-Aug-2013 00:48:12]  <ponicalica> well I already did "I bring nothing into character creation.  No traits, no relationships, no rank." so
[09-Aug-2013 00:48:16]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: sounds roughly right, yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 00:48:20]  <Barcode> :}
[09-Aug-2013 00:48:28]  * Barcode starts doing statshit
[09-Aug-2013 00:48:43]  <Barcode> I was hoping I could do something like, smoke cigarinos and then get by because shit-tier healing magic keeps her healthy.
[09-Aug-2013 00:48:52]  <IllFlower> I guess that puts Rig under Complicated Community, Barcode under Complicated History, and ponicalica under...
[09-Aug-2013 00:48:57]  <Barcode> which is a ripoff of something, no doubt, but.
[09-Aug-2013 00:49:12]  <Rig> Why complicated community?
[09-Aug-2013 00:49:17]  *** Nitya_ <~Glossina@71-222-34-38.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[09-Aug-2013 00:49:20]  <IllFlower> I'm kind of leaning towards Strong Community or Strong History.
[09-Aug-2013 00:49:25]  <Barcode> oh, you mixed those two up, didntyou
[09-Aug-2013 00:49:26]  <ponicalica> I think Strong History is the one that fits that.
[09-Aug-2013 00:49:33]  *** Nitya_ <~Glossina@71-222-34-38.ptld.qwest.net> has left #madokamadness
[09-Aug-2013 00:50:27]  <IllFlower> Rig: I tend to interpret Complicated Community as "grew up in difficult circumstances" and Complicated History as "*was* the difficult circumstance."
[09-Aug-2013 00:50:29]  <Barcode> Community is "socially vulnerable or from a broken, in-crisis, or destructive family." vs History is "overcome a troubled, dangerous, or challenging upbringing."  I assume Community means you kind of live still connected to your backgrounbd/thriving in it, while History is you succeeding past it.
[09-Aug-2013 00:50:43]  <Barcode> opposite position <_<
[09-Aug-2013 00:50:52]  <Barcode> I can do either ,of course. I'd just like to sort which is which.
[09-Aug-2013 00:50:52]  <ponicalica> though I could probably be convinced of the opposite
[09-Aug-2013 00:51:12]  <Rig> I was imagining that the community thing would be something you are still involved in to some extent.
[09-Aug-2013 00:51:50]  <IllFlower> Mechanics-wise, the difference betweent he two is that Community carries more Relationship dice, while History carries more Trait dice.
[09-Aug-2013 00:52:21]  <IllFlower> So I suppose Community is more for if interactions with specific people define the character, while History is about experiences.
[09-Aug-2013 00:52:22]  <Rig> I kind of wanted the complicated bit to involve a dead boyfriend.
[09-Aug-2013 00:52:26]  <Barcode> IllFlower: When I ran through a test character I noticed you get 4d4 if you do Complicated Community. I assumed that meant "you have a bunch of ugly things in your past that can bite you in the ass".
[09-Aug-2013 00:52:33]  <Rig> I'm not sure how relationships work with dead characters.
[09-Aug-2013 00:52:42]  <Barcode> 4d4 in Relationships*
[09-Aug-2013 00:52:54]  <Barcode> Rig: Wlel, it's RP'd, so it could be "if something reminds you of boyfriend, pull in these dice".
[09-Aug-2013 00:53:07]  <Barcode> triggers, i guess you could say.
[09-Aug-2013 00:53:12]  <IllFlower> Barcode: Yeah, or there are relationships that cause you trouble, or hamstring you in conflict.
[09-Aug-2013 00:53:36]  <Rig> I suppose it really could go either way.
[09-Aug-2013 00:53:41]  <IllFlower> So Rig, if the "dead boyfriend" thing is something that your character has trouble with, I could see it being a d4 relationship.
[09-Aug-2013 00:53:56]  <Rig> Yeah, so, should I do complicated community too then?
[09-Aug-2013 00:54:29]  <IllFlower> I think so. I actually think Barcode's idea is more suited to Complicated History myself.
[09-Aug-2013 00:54:36]  <Barcode> Whichever works.
[09-Aug-2013 00:54:42]  * Barcode switches to History
[09-Aug-2013 00:54:44]  <Barcode> IllFlower: Oh, that's something I didn't undersatnd -- so like, if you have dice in Relationships, and someone's facing you in a Conflict, could they take /your/ dice if the relationship works to their advantage? or would it still be yours?
[09-Aug-2013 00:54:49]  <IllFlower> His character would be more likely to have traits like "quick to judgment d8" or whatever.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:04]  <Rig> Barcode: It's still yours.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:05]  * Barcode finds, puts on MBurst playlist.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:08]  <Barcode> Rig: m.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:09]  <Rig> Just a d4 is less useful.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:12]  <IllFlower> Barcode: No, usually dice that are assigned to a character belong solely to that character.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:25]  <Rig> You need more d4 to See a good Raise.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:36]  <Barcode> Right. I just was thinking, you'd still have more dice to begin with.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:45]  <Barcode> though i assume you never really run out of dice in Dogflicts.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:52]  <Rig> Well, you do.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:58]  <Rig> Or you escalate.
[09-Aug-2013 00:55:59]  <Barcode> oh right. then you Escalate.
[09-Aug-2013 00:56:02]  <IllFlower> Barcode: You may have more dice, but Seeing with more than two dice inflicts Fallout.
[09-Aug-2013 00:56:10]  <Barcode> Right.
[09-Aug-2013 00:56:36]  <IllFlower> I like to think of it as giving you the option to take Fallout should you think it fits the character's situation.
[09-Aug-2013 00:56:41]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@108-91-87-34.lightspeed.cicril.sbcglobal.net> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.90.1 [Firefox 22.0/20130618035212])
[09-Aug-2013 00:56:46]  <Rig> Wow, that's a lot of relationship dice.
[09-Aug-2013 00:57:01]  <Barcode> hee
[09-Aug-2013 00:57:04]  <Rig> Yeah, essentially, does this hurt you Shepard?
[09-Aug-2013 00:57:04]  <IllFlower> Okay, before we get into stats, is everyone happy with their backgrounds?
[09-Aug-2013 00:57:18]  <Rig> I think mine makes sense now that we've talked it out.
[09-Aug-2013 00:57:36]  <Barcode> I'm good with mine; "overcoming" an ugly upbringing can still mean developing unhealthy habits.
[09-Aug-2013 00:57:48]  <IllFlower> ponicalica?
[09-Aug-2013 00:57:58]  <ponicalica> I think so, yeah
[09-Aug-2013 00:58:05]  <Barcode> I do dislike that I can't have like, d4 relationships with people who still want to stick a knife in my character's ribs, but wotever, I'll think of something else.
[09-Aug-2013 00:58:34]  <Rig> Maybe you can turn those into advantages.
[09-Aug-2013 00:58:43]  <Rig> You know they hate you and that makes you stronger and more ready.
[09-Aug-2013 00:59:03]  <IllFlower> "haters feed me"
[09-Aug-2013 00:59:15]  <Barcode> great. i'm going to have a rapdoka
[09-Aug-2013 00:59:20]  <Rig> 1d10 - I be speaking swaghili
[09-Aug-2013 00:59:25]  <Barcode> Swaghili (fluent)

[09-Aug-2013 01:00:01]  <Rig> Hah.
[09-Aug-2013 01:00:03]  <IllFlower> Now I'm imagining a magical girl rapping "fuck critics, they can kiss my whole asshole."
[09-Aug-2013 01:00:10]  <Rig> Yes.
[09-Aug-2013 01:00:18]  <Rig> I told you. I'm playing Kanye.
[09-Aug-2013 01:00:21]  <ponicalica> I'd say we're all too white to actually try to do a rap-based meguca game, but IllFlower is Asian.

[09-Aug-2013 01:00:58]  <Barcode> i actually don't know if any of the guys who worked on that song are asian. they sure as hell ripped off the ol' Oriental Riff thing, if they aren't

[09-Aug-2013 01:02:25]  <Rig> Juan: Raplic priests aren't Kayne?
[09-Aug-2013 01:02:26]  <Barcode> Jewels and Gems is a song I actually like.
[09-Aug-2013 01:02:27]  <IllFlower> Well, lest we forget, the whole Wu-Tang thing was full of Shaolin references, so.
[09-Aug-2013 01:02:46]  <Juan> what if wu-tang but with magical girls
[09-Aug-2013 01:02:57]  <IllFlower> Anyway, let us press on to stats!
[09-Aug-2013 01:02:57]  <Rig> Anyway, Stats.
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:05]  <IllFlower> A reminder here that Acuity also covers magical ability.
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:09]  <Barcode> right. remember you have 2d6 by default, and those steal from your stats pool.
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:13]  <Barcode> oh, thanks. i was wondering ab out that
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:19]  <Juan> Rig: Juan: Raplic priests aren't Kayne? // oh nono, IllFlower was quoting Jay-Z, that's all
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:19]  <Barcode> fuck. now i can't play a dumb doker.
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:30]  <Juan> when am i not needlessly pedantic you may ask
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:35]  <Juan> when i'm asleep i would answer
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:43]  <Rig> Nah, you're still an ass then.
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:46]  <Rig> Just a cuter ass.
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:54]  <ponicalica> so 13d6-8d6 automatic means that I have 5d6 left to put into traits
[09-Aug-2013 01:03:58]  <Juan> but not pedantic~
[09-Aug-2013 01:04:05]  <Barcode> yep
[09-Aug-2013 01:04:07]  <Barcode> @calica
[09-Aug-2013 01:04:26]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Stats, but yeah. (Traits are something different.)
[09-Aug-2013 01:04:29]  <Rig> So, I have 7d6.
[09-Aug-2013 01:04:31]  <ponicalica> er, yeah, stats >_<
[09-Aug-2013 01:04:41]  <ponicalica> Rig: yeah, you and barcode have seven dee six
[09-Aug-2013 01:04:45]  <Rig> I dunno if Heart would work for my character.
[09-Aug-2013 01:05:02]  <Rig> I feel like she's compassionate because she wants to save other people, but she's also damaged by that.
[09-Aug-2013 01:05:02]  <IllFlower> Is your character the heartful type?
[09-Aug-2013 01:05:25]  <ponicalica> Heart might work for my character but on the other hand I'm not sure that I, as in ponicalica, could play someone who actually has high heart :p
[09-Aug-2013 01:05:28]  <IllFlower> Rig: You can take the downside as a d4 relationship, maybe.
[09-Aug-2013 01:05:38]  <Barcode> IllFlower: Magic is exclusively Acuity, or can we like, blend it with Heart and Will when we'd like, or something?
[09-Aug-2013 01:05:46]  <Barcode> when in conflict*
[09-Aug-2013 01:05:49]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: A law-and-order type might be more Acuity/Will in any case.
[09-Aug-2013 01:05:50]  <Rig> Well, you never roll a stat alone.
[09-Aug-2013 01:05:58]  <IllFlower> Barcode: Magical conflicts are Ac/Wl.
[09-Aug-2013 01:06:02]  <Barcode> m.
[09-Aug-2013 01:06:14]  <ponicalica> Ac/Ht is when you're just talking
[09-Aug-2013 01:06:47]  <IllFlower> The way we've set the system up, it's not much for heartful magic.
[09-Aug-2013 01:06:58]  <Barcode> right right.
[09-Aug-2013 01:07:36]  <IllFlower> Barcode: Okay, so your character is the physical, stubborn type?
[09-Aug-2013 01:07:41]  <Barcode> Just was thinking about that.
[09-Aug-2013 01:08:09]  <IllFlower> Rig: And yours is also a little physical, but more emotional?
[09-Aug-2013 01:08:21]  <Rig> Okay, I think I've got a decent idea of my character. She's physically strong but compassionate.
[09-Aug-2013 01:08:36]  <Rig> She wants to put herself in the way of other people getting hurt.
[09-Aug-2013 01:08:47]  <Barcode> I'm thinking of going high Will because mean, decent Body because street-sleight-of-hand, but dunno about the others. Crime is about being clever in specific ways, not really about being physically tough unless you're mugging people. Though maybe that's what she was up to.
[09-Aug-2013 01:08:53]  <ponicalica> 2111 221 32, what do I want my character to be, hm, hm
[09-Aug-2013 01:09:06]  <IllFlower> Rig: I was thinking Wl might be a little low, unless you mean to imply she folds easily in the face of adversity?
[09-Aug-2013 01:09:27]  <Rig> No, probably not.
[09-Aug-2013 01:09:50]  <Rig> Maybe that works better.
[09-Aug-2013 01:09:50]  <ponicalica> ironically I think strong community/history makes you in general not as powerful unless something important to you gets involved?
[09-Aug-2013 01:10:12]  <Rig> ponicalica: Nah, Strong History is all about traits.
[09-Aug-2013 01:10:12]  <Barcode> Your traits are crazy.
[09-Aug-2013 01:10:18]  <Rig> Like, you have 3d10s.
[09-Aug-2013 01:10:23]  <Rig> You are stacked.
[09-Aug-2013 01:10:31]  <Barcode> So like, you get to pick a whole shit-ton of stuff you want your character to do well.
[09-Aug-2013 01:11:02]  <IllFlower> Rig: If you want to bump up the other stats, you could take the extra d6 off Ac. Something like not getting the opportunity to be particularly well-educated in magic or whatever, because of how much stress she gets from constantly throwing herself into harm's way.
[09-Aug-2013 01:11:10]  <ponicalica> oh, true, the traits are more general, relationships are more specific
[09-Aug-2013 01:11:32]  <Barcode> Right now I'm trying to decide if I want my character to be unrepentantly jerkish or more-than-barely moveable by certain things. Maybe I should play a total weakling.
[09-Aug-2013 01:11:39]  <IllFlower> Barcode: Similar for your character and Ht. If your character is as rough as I'm thinking, she might not be much for compassion or reasonable judgment.
[09-Aug-2013 01:11:45]  <Barcode> Yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 01:11:47]  <Rig> Traits are what you bring to conflict, Relationships are why you're in conflict.
[09-Aug-2013 01:11:57]  <Barcode> If I wanna go with "she just gets the job done" moving the thing from Heart to Acuity'll work well.
[09-Aug-2013 01:12:02]  <IllFlower> Rig: That's a good way to put it.
[09-Aug-2013 01:12:18]  <Rig> Pretty much verbatim from the rules.
[09-Aug-2013 01:12:40]  <Barcode> The base is 2d6, after all; it's not like my character is going to be a robot just because she's not particularly lion-hearted.
[09-Aug-2013 01:13:08]  <IllFlower> Barcode: So the impression I get from this distribution is that you're playing a devious, physical, get-it-done-by-any-means kind of character. Very emotionally guarded.
[09-Aug-2013 01:13:32]  <Rig> Ugh, I can't decide if Heart or Body should be 3d6. Help?
[09-Aug-2013 01:13:56]  <IllFlower> Rig: Considering how emotionally fraught her background is likely to be, I think putting it on Ht would work best.
[09-Aug-2013 01:14:10]  <Barcode> IllFlower: Yeah. "Emotionally guarded" would have to mean some well-hidden weaknesses, which I still gotta figure out.
[09-Aug-2013 01:14:24]  <IllFlower> Barcode: That's what the traits are for. :p
[09-Aug-2013 01:14:28]  <Barcode> true.
[09-Aug-2013 01:14:49]  <IllFlower> I'm going to write down brief character summaries in the pad.
[09-Aug-2013 01:14:53]  <Barcode> Rig: Yeah, it could be like, "well, I can hardly focus at the best of times, but if I actually get to seeing something i care about..."
[09-Aug-2013 01:14:57]  <ponicalica> hmm, I think I have a tentative distribution...except I put the dice in the wrong traits :V
[09-Aug-2013 01:15:01]  <ponicalica> now they should be right
[09-Aug-2013 01:15:06]  <Barcode> IllFlower: i was just gonna summarize my reasoning behind the individual stats now.
[09-Aug-2013 01:15:10]  <Barcode> (for myself)
[09-Aug-2013 01:15:42]  <Rig> ponicalica: So, a character who isn't terribly emotional, but is smart and opinionated?
[09-Aug-2013 01:15:43]  <IllFlower> Barcode: Works for me.
[09-Aug-2013 01:16:30]  <Alicia> (This is fun.)
[09-Aug-2013 01:19:37]  <IllFlower> ponicalica?
[09-Aug-2013 01:20:02]  <ponicalica> Rig: I think so.  Considering emphasizing the magical acuity(a prodigy type?) by moving the extra Body die into Acuity, but I'm not sure if I want that or the better-rounded stats
[09-Aug-2013 01:20:23]  <Rig> Well, what would the character be like?
[09-Aug-2013 01:20:45]  <Rig> A prodigy sounds pretty fun.
[09-Aug-2013 01:20:54]  <Barcode> It'd fit into the whole "By the books" thing too.
[09-Aug-2013 01:21:08]  <IllFlower> Someone picked to become a magical girl on the basis of latent ability.
[09-Aug-2013 01:21:20]  <Barcode> You're taught, you've excelled in practice...maybe some other stuff leaves something to be desired.
[09-Aug-2013 01:21:29]  <IllFlower> I could see her being a Hermione type.
[09-Aug-2013 01:22:52]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: i.e. knows about witchification mostly from books rather than, e.g. seeing Kei Shinagawa cut herself, etc.?  Yeah, I think that aspect could come out  (also, lol, using things from the aborted MB campaign to illustrate)
[09-Aug-2013 01:23:14]  * Rig pictures Barcode's character as Dale Earnhardt.
[09-Aug-2013 01:23:25]  <Barcode> snerk
[09-Aug-2013 01:23:51]  <IllFlower> Hm, that raises an interesting paradox with Wl, because I could see someone who is simultaneously bullheaded when it comes to discussing things in the abstract, but immediately shies away once things get to actual violence and despair.
[09-Aug-2013 01:24:24]  <Barcode> IllFlower: Not exactly. It's pretty easy to be incredibly vicious as long as you don't really think through what you're doing.
[09-Aug-2013 01:24:45]  <Barcode> If someone were to stop this character ot htink about what she's doing, maybe successfully get her to think of her own experience, she'd probably collapse, sure. But that's what acting fast is for.
[09-Aug-2013 01:24:46]  <IllFlower> I mean speaking to ponicalica's circumstances specifically.
[09-Aug-2013 01:24:49]  <Barcode> oh. oops
[09-Aug-2013 01:25:47]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Well, if I had d4 traits, I might use those for them
[09-Aug-2013 01:26:25]  <IllFlower> Hm.
[09-Aug-2013 01:26:34]  <ponicalica> s/them/that/
[09-Aug-2013 01:26:48]  <Barcode> Lemme know when we're ready to do traits.
[09-Aug-2013 01:27:13]  <ponicalica> Barcode: traits come once I'm finalized on my stats, I think.  I'm still working through that >_>
[09-Aug-2013 01:27:19]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: I think the best way to work this out is slanting heavily on Ac, putting maybe 1d6 on Wl, and then having a "well-read" d8/10 trait.
[09-Aug-2013 01:27:21]  <Barcode> heh, np.
[09-Aug-2013 01:27:37]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: yeah, probably a good choice
[09-Aug-2013 01:29:10]  * Barcode looks for some resistance bands.
[09-Aug-2013 01:29:24]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: How does that summary look to your eyes?
[09-Aug-2013 01:30:11]  <ponicalica> That sounds good to me.
[09-Aug-2013 01:30:43]  <IllFlower> Barcode, ponicalica, Rig: Okay, traits up next.
[09-Aug-2013 01:31:25]  * Barcode crax knuckles
[09-Aug-2013 01:31:35]  * Rig crax ribs
[09-Aug-2013 01:31:38]  * ponicalica crax neck

[09-Aug-2013 01:32:45]  <Alicia> Thanks.
[09-Aug-2013 01:32:54]  <Rig> What sort of traits are people putting?
[09-Aug-2013 01:33:16]  <Barcode> “I used to break horses with my dad.” so when we find horses, I can break them in half.
[09-Aug-2013 01:33:33]  <ponicalica> I don't think cities have very many horses
[09-Aug-2013 01:33:36]  <ponicalica> anymore
[09-Aug-2013 01:33:45]  <Barcode> Thinking.
[09-Aug-2013 01:33:59]  <IllFlower> Tangent: How does "conservator" sound as a title for the members of our little regulatory order?
[09-Aug-2013 01:34:24]  <Rig> Works for me.
[09-Aug-2013 01:34:39]  <Barcode> Could do that.
[09-Aug-2013 01:34:50]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: sort of makes me think of "conservatory", but works for me, better than "fixer" I think
[09-Aug-2013 01:34:54]  <Rig> 4d4 in a single trait?
[09-Aug-2013 01:35:01]  <Barcode> I don't know yet, just throwing stuff out there.
[09-Aug-2013 01:35:18]  <ponicalica> I think an addiction as a 4d4 trait is a bit much
[09-Aug-2013 01:35:34]  <ponicalica> also are our characters even twenty
[09-Aug-2013 01:35:47]  <Rig> Yeah, what kind of age is this?
[09-Aug-2013 01:35:57]  <Rig> "A dark age. An age of might and magic."
[09-Aug-2013 01:35:57]  <Barcode> i was about to say something but an age would be useful.
[09-Aug-2013 01:36:01]  <Barcode> lol.
[09-Aug-2013 01:36:11]  <IllFlower> I was thinking late teens, early twenties.
[09-Aug-2013 01:36:15]  <Barcode> Given they're "fixers" maybe they'd be like, at least on their way out of high school, yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 01:36:24]  <Barcode> at /least/*
[09-Aug-2013 01:36:59]  <Rig> Is this set in Japan?
[09-Aug-2013 01:37:11]  <ponicalica> Rig: I think it's still in IllFlower's Kikugawa (not to be confused with the real one)
[09-Aug-2013 01:37:15]  <Barcode> Yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 01:37:21]  <Rig> @w Kikugawa

[09-Aug-2013 01:37:43]  <ponicalica> not that kikugawa
[09-Aug-2013 01:37:46]  <IllFlower> I remember thinking about this last night, actually. I came up with something to the extent of "Attrition is high around twenty as the girls become adults, though some stick around. It's rare to see anyone above thirty, conservator or not."
[09-Aug-2013 01:38:21]  <IllFlower> Some of them may be as young as the characters were in our MB campaign, though.
[09-Aug-2013 01:38:44]  <Barcode> @yt drop the other

[09-Aug-2013 01:38:50]  <IllFlower> I don't see any inherent reason the characters' ages can't vary, but it's something we'll have to discuss.
[09-Aug-2013 01:38:59]  <IllFlower> (I certainly hope they're a little more variable than they were in MB, haha.)
[09-Aug-2013 01:39:17]  <Barcode> It'd be fun for Ponny to be our straight arrow and also the youngest, maybe.
[09-Aug-2013 01:39:21]  <IllFlower> e.g. I could see ponicalica's character being younger, newer.
[09-Aug-2013 01:39:22]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 01:39:28]  <IllFlower> Barcode's is older, more jaded.
[09-Aug-2013 01:39:30]  <ponicalica> then again, as far as "not even twenty" goes, it's not like you don't see people under twenty-one drinking, but as far as keeping those d4s out, you'd probably want to be able to legally drink
[09-Aug-2013 01:39:42]  <ponicalica> And yeah, I was figuring that, given the relative lack of experience, my character would be a bit younger
[09-Aug-2013 01:39:44]  <IllFlower> Rig's sits in the middle.
[09-Aug-2013 01:40:00]  <Rig> Works for me.
[09-Aug-2013 01:40:03]  <IllFlower> So maybe ponicalica's is 16, Rig's is 18 or 19, Barcode's is 20 to 22-ish.
[09-Aug-2013 01:40:11]  <Rig> 18.
[09-Aug-2013 01:40:18]  <Rig> Senior in high school.

[09-Aug-2013 01:42:00]  <Fiora> rig-senpaii~
[09-Aug-2013 01:42:13]  <Barcode> IllFlower: Does the idea of specifically having history with gangs bug you/seem a bit excessive? I could still play this character without that tidbit, I just wanted a reason to be so mean. I guess "used to the emgirl life" could work too.
[09-Aug-2013 01:42:22]  <Barcode> though i mean, i alreayd picked a background.
[09-Aug-2013 01:42:32]  <IllFlower> Barcode: Also, if she's as much of a troublemaker as implied, starting drinking and smoking at 14 or 15 wouldn't be out of the question.
[09-Aug-2013 01:42:41]  <Barcode> yeah, s'what iw as thinking.
[09-Aug-2013 01:42:46]  <IllFlower> I don't think gangs would fit, that would be more of a Community thing.
[09-Aug-2013 01:42:53]  <Barcode> m.
[09-Aug-2013 01:43:03]  <Barcode> So more just, going out and getting into trouble, rather than getting into organized trouble.
[09-Aug-2013 01:43:08]  <IllFlower> w/r/t causing trouble it seems like your character is more of a lone wolf.
[09-Aug-2013 01:43:11]  <IllFlower> Right, that.
[09-Aug-2013 01:43:19]  <Rig> Can we use an entire group as a relationship?
[09-Aug-2013 01:43:30]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 01:43:33]  <Rig> Right, we can. The manual actually mentions "Dogs" as a relationship.
[09-Aug-2013 01:43:36]  <Barcode> oh right, don't forget you need "I'm a dog (bark)" as a d6 trait.
[09-Aug-2013 01:43:45]  <Barcode> unless you're not actually a fixer, but we don't have any of those.
[09-Aug-2013 01:43:50]  <IllFlower> Not d6, necessarily.
[09-Aug-2013 01:43:53]  <Barcode> hm.
[09-Aug-2013 01:44:13]  <Barcode> oh, then i'll go with a 1d10 for that, just because, being older and all that.
[09-Aug-2013 01:44:38]  <IllFlower> And actually I think the manual doesn't accommodate characters *not* being Dogs; it just says that the each character's status as a Dog has to manifest as either a relationship or a trait.
[09-Aug-2013 01:44:50]  <Barcode> oh, i thought the implication was they dodn't have to be dogs.
[09-Aug-2013 01:44:59]  <Barcode> Not really an issue, I Guess.
[09-Aug-2013 01:45:00]  <ponicalica> Barcode: you need "I'm a dog (bark)" or relationship with the dogs (bark)
[09-Aug-2013 01:45:09]  <Barcode> ponicalica: canine (fluent)
[09-Aug-2013 01:45:31]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Magicians have libraries too, you know.
[09-Aug-2013 01:46:18]  <IllFlower> I'd say you should probably have four or five traits before we proceed, as the manual suggests.
[09-Aug-2013 01:47:04]  <Barcode> I feel kinda dumb spending 2d10 in "fixer", it feels a little munchkinny.
[09-Aug-2013 01:47:28]  <Barcode> Oh! that's what i was wondering. Can I have some healing magic capabilities? Perhaps her habits are partially supplemented by the fact that she can keep them from bogging her down.
[09-Aug-2013 01:48:01]  <Barcode> Doesn't cover nicotine addiction in and of itself, of course.

[09-Aug-2013 01:48:34]  <IllFlower> Barcode: It does make sense, on the other hand. Your character seems like she would relish the power of being a conservator, and draw strength from it.
[09-Aug-2013 01:48:37]  <ponicalica> Barcode: well, spending 2d10 on fixer I think would mean that you get strength from your affiliation

[09-Aug-2013 01:50:48]  <Rig> Yeah, probably.
[09-Aug-2013 01:50:58]  <Nitya> Rig: it's an mgirl transform, you gotta show some np
[09-Aug-2013 01:51:07]  <Fiora> Nitya:    that     I do'nt even 
[09-Aug-2013 01:51:13]  <Barcode> it's awesome, hence "holy shit"
[09-Aug-2013 01:51:19]  <SpruceZeus> Nitya: perfect
[09-Aug-2013 01:51:23]  <Barcode> Only thing is then I've got 2d6 in Brawler and 2d10 in Fixer. Is that like, okay?
[09-Aug-2013 01:51:42]  <Barcode> unless I should a d10 specifically in like, "intimidating"
[09-Aug-2013 01:51:46]  <Barcode> should/could*
[09-Aug-2013 01:51:46]  <IllFlower> I don't think it's too much of a problem. Any particular concern you have?

[09-Aug-2013 01:51:50]  <Nitya> now back to your gaem.
[09-Aug-2013 01:52:07]  <Barcode> Oh, I just don't know the typical distribution of dice for this sorta thing.
[09-Aug-2013 01:52:23]  <IllFlower> It seems reasonable. As long as you can justify it, I don't think it's too much of a problem.
[09-Aug-2013 01:52:31]  <Barcode> m.
[09-Aug-2013 01:52:32]  <Barcode> Also not sure if I should have more traits, but if four or five are fine, really, there's not much else to do.
[09-Aug-2013 01:52:41]  <Barcode> yeah, i could have 2d10 be part of the whole magic expertise thing.
[09-Aug-2013 01:53:06]  <Rig> I want a trait that isn't entirely related to anything about being a Dog/Fixer/Girlthing
[09-Aug-2013 01:53:16]  <Barcode> girls at all, huh
[09-Aug-2013 01:53:51]  <Barcode> i was gonna say something like "sometimes you just gotta step in and bear the consequences", but
[09-Aug-2013 01:53:54]  <IllFlower> Rig: You mean is something completely unrelated?
[09-Aug-2013 01:53:55]  <Barcode> might be similar to the second.
[09-Aug-2013 01:54:02]  <Rig> Yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 01:54:20]  <Rig> I want something that won't come up terribly often, but fleshes out the character.
[09-Aug-2013 01:54:21]  <IllFlower> Barcode: I think the brawling and the guardedness are sufficiently not-magic-specific.
[09-Aug-2013 01:54:29]  <Barcode> Cool.
[09-Aug-2013 01:54:53]  <IllFlower> Rig: A certain fear, maybe?
[09-Aug-2013 01:54:58]  <Rig> Hm.
[09-Aug-2013 01:55:07]  <Barcode> "not this again"?
[09-Aug-2013 01:55:14]  <IllFlower> Based on something that came to be symbolic of her childhood, maybe.
[09-Aug-2013 01:56:11]  <IllFlower> Maybe she doesn't like knives, or rats, or enclosed spaces.
[09-Aug-2013 01:56:40]  <IllFlower> I could see the last one, actually. She throws herself in harm's way, but things go south if it turns into just her and an aggressor.
[09-Aug-2013 01:56:55]  <Rig> Hm, that's not bad.
[09-Aug-2013 01:56:57]  <IllFlower> Oh, er, actually, that wouldn't work all that well with d6/8, would it.
[09-Aug-2013 01:57:03]  <IllFlower> That's more of a d4 thing.
[09-Aug-2013 01:57:14]  <Rig> I guess so.
[09-Aug-2013 01:57:23]  * Barcode looks at hte cover of Biomega Volume 3. gets outfit ideas
[09-Aug-2013 01:58:18]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: I don't think there's anything wrong with "trusts the system" as something beyond "I'm a conservator."
[09-Aug-2013 01:58:41]  <IllFlower> Given that Barcode's character has "I'm a conservator" in a fashion that doesn't at all imply "has faith in the system."
[09-Aug-2013 01:58:48]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: true, especially in contrast to Barcode's...yeah
[09-Aug-2013 01:58:52]  <Barcode> heeheehee
[09-Aug-2013 01:59:15]  <Barcode> well we'll see if i'll be cynical or just violently pragmatic
[09-Aug-2013 01:59:44]  <Barcode> Oh, that's a decent one.
[09-Aug-2013 02:00:00]  <ponicalica> hmmm, should probably think of something relating specifically to magical powers, as well
[09-Aug-2013 02:00:07]  <IllFlower> Rig: I like that. Fights better in open spaces etc.
[09-Aug-2013 02:00:23]  <Rig> It still provides a negative trait, but does it in a positive way.
[09-Aug-2013 02:00:45]  <IllFlower> Exactly.
[09-Aug-2013 02:01:10]  <Barcode> ponicalica: Maybe you excel in some specific element.
[09-Aug-2013 02:01:21]  <IllFlower> Rig: Oh, incidentally, would your character be more of the "make friends at all costs" type, or the "generally friendly, but you're done for once you're on her bad side" type?
[09-Aug-2013 02:01:33]  <IllFlower> I'm leaning towards the latter given the 4d6 Wl.
[09-Aug-2013 02:02:15]  <Rig> The latter.
[09-Aug-2013 02:02:47]  <ponicalica> Barcode: yeah, maybe, though it's harder than MB where I used the RNG :P
[09-Aug-2013 02:02:50]  <Rig> ponicalica: If you really want a magical trait maybe you could take something related to mirrors?
[09-Aug-2013 02:03:00]  <Rig> I dunno why.
[09-Aug-2013 02:03:11]  <Rig> Mirrors or books.
[09-Aug-2013 02:03:20]  <Barcode> "I have a magical spinfusor."
[09-Aug-2013 02:03:21]  <Rig> Oh man. She should wield a gavel.
[09-Aug-2013 02:03:27]  <IllFlower> Rig: Haha, ponicalica's element in the MB campaign was glass.
[09-Aug-2013 02:03:29]  <ponicalica> Rig: probably because you read the Shirayuki thing? :P
[09-Aug-2013 02:03:40]  <Rig> Nope.
[09-Aug-2013 02:03:44]  <Barcode> Rig: two-handed gavel? 1.5hand gavel?
[09-Aug-2013 02:03:51]  <Rig> Bastard gavel.
[09-Aug-2013 02:03:54]  <Barcode> yesss
[09-Aug-2013 02:04:04]  <IllFlower> I like the elemental thing, though. We made accommodations for it in the adapted setting, but nobody's used it.
[09-Aug-2013 02:04:17]  <Nitya> kind of an asshole gavel
[09-Aug-2013 02:04:25]  <Barcode> oh right, that was supposed to be a potential trait wasn't it
[09-Aug-2013 02:04:42]  <Rig> Well, I could make my trait more specific, but I just like the idea that my character fights mostly defensively.
[09-Aug-2013 02:04:52]  <Barcode> the fearsome BLOCKER
[09-Aug-2013 02:05:02]  <Rig> I was even gonna pick out a school of swordsmanship that is about defense.
[09-Aug-2013 02:05:20]  <Barcode> oh right, we don't have a uh, items headin.g that  comes after relationships though, right?
[09-Aug-2013 02:05:25]  * Barcode checks manual.
[09-Aug-2013 02:05:26]  <Rig> yeah
[09-Aug-2013 02:05:26]  <IllFlower> Rig: That seems like more of an aikido thing, haha.
[09-Aug-2013 02:05:31]  <IllFlower> Barcode: We do.
[09-Aug-2013 02:05:52]  <Rig> There are schools that borrow pretty heavily from aikido.
[09-Aug-2013 02:05:59]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: we don't in the piratepad
[09-Aug-2013 02:06:09]  <Rig> Plus I've played too many aikido characters in my time.
[09-Aug-2013 02:06:23]  <Barcode> oh shit, ponny still needs traits >_<
[09-Aug-2013 02:06:30]  <IllFlower> We do now.
[09-Aug-2013 02:06:30]  <ponicalica> Barcode: ponny's still thinking of traits
[09-Aug-2013 02:06:40]  <Rig> How about water?
[09-Aug-2013 02:06:44]  <Barcode> ponicalica: if you don't mind being drab, you could have like, a trait like "knowledge about witches"
[09-Aug-2013 02:06:52]  <ponicalica> Barcode: I think that falls under well-read
[09-Aug-2013 02:07:11]  <Barcode> Well you could have like, book smarts, and then witch smarts separate. though again maybe not too fun to work with?
[09-Aug-2013 02:07:20]  <Barcode> since arcaneshit is pretty divorced from. physics
[09-Aug-2013 02:07:25]  <IllFlower> Yeah, I think another trait would be kinda redundant.
[09-Aug-2013 02:07:31]  <Barcode> m.
[09-Aug-2013 02:07:37]  <IllFlower> Water elemental. Likes dogs, haha.
[09-Aug-2013 02:07:59]  <Barcode> glass is weird anyway, it's like, amorphous
[09-Aug-2013 02:08:29]  <Rig> Calm under pressure?
[09-Aug-2013 02:08:29]  <ponicalica> Barcode: well, like, non-magical booksmarts, in particular as separate from magical ones, aren't going to come up often enough I think
[09-Aug-2013 02:08:36]  <Rig> No, that doesn't work.
[09-Aug-2013 02:08:42]  <Rig> How about something related to her school?
[09-Aug-2013 02:08:44]  <ponicalica> Rig: are these for me?
[09-Aug-2013 02:08:46]  <Barcode> yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 02:08:48]  <Rig> Or her mundane life?
[09-Aug-2013 02:08:50]  <Rig> Yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 02:08:57]  <Rig> Just tossing ideas around.
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:06]  <Barcode> a club activity or something?
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:08]  <ponicalica> I don't get IllFlower's "Water elemental, likes dogs" comment
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:13]  <IllFlower> Just some ideas.
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:14]  <Barcode> dogs would be a separate trait
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:22]  <Barcode> you can break horses in Dogs vanilla, so like.
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:28]  <ponicalica> break horses?
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:32]  <Rig> "Can melt that heatsink"
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:36]  <Barcode> in half. (I don't know. i think it's a training thing)
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:38]  <Rig> "Can find the bomb"
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:46]  <ponicalica> Rig: oh my god jc
[09-Aug-2013 02:09:55]  <Rig> Oh, she could be in like a robotics club!?
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:02]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Basically, training a horse such that it'll take riders.
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:05]  <Rig> "Has augmented vision"
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:07]  <Barcode> then she could have robotics;notes
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:13]  <Barcode> as an item
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:13]  <ponicalica> oh, I thought you meant actually break, like, in half
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:15]  <ponicalica> that makes way more sense
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:21]  <Barcode> XD sorry for putting that idea in your head
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:34]  <IllFlower> None of you are particularly equestrian types, are you. :p
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:38]  <ponicalica> not at all
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:38]  <Rig> ponicalica: Have you never ridden a horse?
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:41]  <Rig> Is ridden a word?
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:43]  <ponicalica> Rig: noooooope.
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:50]  <Rig> Ah. It's fun.
[09-Aug-2013 02:10:54]  <IllFlower> I've ridden one... maybe twice. A long time ago.
[09-Aug-2013 02:11:00]  <Rig> I rode a few times at summer camp.
[09-Aug-2013 02:11:01]  <Barcode> jesus, this is hard.
[09-Aug-2013 02:11:13]  <Barcode> so many traits
[09-Aug-2013 02:11:20]  <Rig> Barcode: Do you need more?
[09-Aug-2013 02:11:21]  <ponicalica> water + robots just makes me think of a failure of magical waterproofing
[09-Aug-2013 02:11:26]  <Barcode> Rig: oh, no, i'm good. im eant for ponny
[09-Aug-2013 02:11:27]  <Rig> Because I've got words for sale.
[09-Aug-2013 02:11:36]  <Barcode> hee
[09-Aug-2013 02:11:57]  <Rig> ponicalica: Well, like, what's your character do for fun?
[09-Aug-2013 02:11:59]  <Barcode> oh! it can be something she "owns" that isn't an item
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:00]  <ponicalica> though I think a club would fit more under relationships than traits
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:08]  <Barcode> or yeah, shit. migth be more a relationship thing
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:08]  <Rig> Well, it can be either.
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:19]  <Barcode> "head of the internet club"
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:23]  <Barcode> oh! oh yeah  you should get some sort of leadership trait
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:25]  <Rig> I think it depends (again) on whether you fight with it or for it.
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:28]  <IllFlower> Maybe she plays the violin.
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:30]  <Barcode> like, student council president
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:38]  <Barcode> (accidentally wrote "stupid council")
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:56]  <Rig> "revolutionary girl"
[09-Aug-2013 02:12:58]  <ponicalica> someone with a magical girl hobby it seems would not be that good of a student council president
[09-Aug-2013 02:13:06]  <Rig> "Loves magical girl anime"
[09-Aug-2013 02:13:22]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Actually, though, that does seem about right.
[09-Aug-2013 02:13:23]  <Barcode> ponicalica: maybe just like, "born leader"? she tends to take the head of schoolwork projects, etc.
[09-Aug-2013 02:13:32]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Loves to take charge of a situation, at least until it gets messy.
[09-Aug-2013 02:13:40]  <IllFlower> Wants to be the boss, haha.
[09-Aug-2013 02:14:34]  <IllFlower> And then an elemental trait, plus maybe a fifth one for good measure.
[09-Aug-2013 02:14:34]  <Rig> Shizune: The emgirl.
[09-Aug-2013 02:14:37]  <ponicalica> heh, yeah, I think I do like that.  easy-made clash with other students
[09-Aug-2013 02:14:52]  <IllFlower> Rig: We're getting there, aren't we?
[09-Aug-2013 02:15:01]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: do you think it's better if I take being a conservator as a trait or relationship

[09-Aug-2013 02:15:15]  <Rig> Barcode: Katawa
[09-Aug-2013 02:15:23]  <ponicalica> the deaf one
[09-Aug-2013 02:15:25]  <Barcode> ponicalica: It'll help you fill out your traits if you keep it as a trait. Plus, i mean, you /are/ one. iunno
[09-Aug-2013 02:15:47]  <Rig> Oh, I should dice my traits.
[09-Aug-2013 02:15:55]  <Barcode> "reestablishing connection" fuck
[09-Aug-2013 02:16:01]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: The question is, as always, do you fight *with* the power of being a conservator (trait), or *for* the institution of the conservators (relationship)?
[09-Aug-2013 02:17:08]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: I could easily see the latter.
[09-Aug-2013 02:17:14]  <ponicalica> hmm, actually, given what I know, I'm leaning towards the latter.
[09-Aug-2013 02:17:21]  <Barcode> It would help with the whole "supports the heirarchy" thing, yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 02:17:21]  <IllFlower> "I fight to defend the institution of magic" etc.
[09-Aug-2013 02:18:02]  <Barcode> so, then, we'll have two traits, well read and drawn to leadership; and then dogs as relationship. so we need two traits more, minimum...
[09-Aug-2013 02:18:20]  <Barcode> one could be an element, sure. And the other?
[09-Aug-2013 02:18:29]  <Rig> Drawn to leadership reads wrong, by the way.
[09-Aug-2013 02:18:39]  <Barcode> already suggested "born leader", maaan.
[09-Aug-2013 02:18:44]  <Barcode> born-leader*
[09-Aug-2013 02:18:51]  <Rig> It should be more like "takes charge"
[09-Aug-2013 02:19:38]  <Barcode> brb, bathroom.
[09-Aug-2013 02:21:01]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: I do still think an elemental trait would fit well. Seeing as how she has the luxury of reading up on magic, she also has the option of learning more about something she's attracted to.
[09-Aug-2013 02:21:07]  <IllFlower> It's like going to college and picking a major.
[09-Aug-2013 02:21:48]  <ponicalica> Yeah.  I just need to decide if I like water, as suggested, or something else
[09-Aug-2013 02:22:13]  <Rig> Well, what kind of power suits a readerleader.
[09-Aug-2013 02:22:49]  <IllFlower> Oh, hm, maybe she's good at singing. I could actually see this coming in handy.
[09-Aug-2013 02:23:02]  <ponicalica> (also sorry guys for being the drain on the process each round >_<)
[09-Aug-2013 02:23:15]  <Rig> Man, it's not like this isn't a community effort.
[09-Aug-2013 02:23:43]  <Barcode> it's okay; there's that, and also i keep thinking of outfit stuff which is fun
[09-Aug-2013 02:25:51]  <Barcode> diamond, or more specifically, carbon?
[09-Aug-2013 02:25:58]  <Barcode> though that would mean basically you would constantly be able to draw on that power.
[09-Aug-2013 02:25:58]  <ponicalica> I'm almost thinking light, for you see, you need light to read, but that also makes me think that was Fiora's power, lol
[09-Aug-2013 02:26:11]  <ponicalica> well, Yuna's
[09-Aug-2013 02:26:22]  <Barcode> hah. well i mean, that character isn't necessarily involved here. it'sn ot really plagiarism, as long as you don't fight with a flashlight.
[09-Aug-2013 02:26:36]  <Barcode> maybe you wield a Protoss Void Ray.

[09-Aug-2013 02:28:08]  <Barcode> ponicalica: ooh, that'd be cool. like, things go dark, because you're literally gathering light energy to fire off
[09-Aug-2013 02:28:16]  <Barcode> cons: much stronger during daytime
[09-Aug-2013 02:28:39]  <Barcode> pros: can blot out indoors areas if that'd ever be an advantage
[09-Aug-2013 02:28:40]  <IllFlower> You could use it to counter ambushes at night.
[09-Aug-2013 02:28:53]  <Barcode> oh, yeah, "element" doesn't necessarily mean "uses the environment" i suppose.
[09-Aug-2013 02:29:11]  <Barcode> you do have your own. mana. or whatever.
[09-Aug-2013 02:29:31]  <IllFlower> I'm still thinking "loves singing" for the last trait, lol.
[09-Aug-2013 02:29:41]  <Barcode> NO bother to me.
[09-Aug-2013 02:30:46]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: lol, how would that come up
[09-Aug-2013 02:31:29]  <IllFlower> Traits don't have to be directly related, they can come up useful in unexpected situations.
[09-Aug-2013 02:31:58]  <IllFlower> The manual suggests "I'm a good cook," which doesn't seem applicable to conflict until maybe you're fighting against someone's starvation.
[09-Aug-2013 02:32:23]  <Rig> I convince them to stop fighting by making a delicious brunch.
[09-Aug-2013 02:32:29]  <Barcode> i can see cooking  being very useful.
[09-Aug-2013 02:32:41]  <ponicalica> cooking sounds like something that Buttercupistiny would put in for emdog Yui
[09-Aug-2013 02:32:42]  <Rig> I mean, one of our conflicts was fixing a farm machine.
[09-Aug-2013 02:32:50]  <Barcode> you will first have to win a conflict with my character, who would rather punch them until they lose their lunch.
[09-Aug-2013 02:33:03]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: For dice, just assign the traits most important to helping your character fight the largest dice.

[09-Aug-2013 02:33:26]  <ponicalica> also I feel kind of awkward having the most dice but the least traits to put them between XD
[09-Aug-2013 02:33:42]  <Barcode> ponicalica: heh, it just means they'll be stronger traits. i was weirded out by putting 2d10 in /anything/
[09-Aug-2013 02:33:53]  <Barcode> pixiv is not helping me figure out a pants reference.
[09-Aug-2013 02:33:55]  <Barcode> i am using gears of war instead.
[09-Aug-2013 02:33:57]  <Rig> You people and all your trait dice.
[09-Aug-2013 02:34:10]  <ponicalica> Rig: I think both barcode and you have eight, I have ten
[09-Aug-2013 02:34:24]  <Barcode> yeah, but you've got 3d8. which is insane.
[09-Aug-2013 02:34:31]  <Barcode> 3d10* 4d8 too
[09-Aug-2013 02:34:32]  <Rig> 4d8
[09-Aug-2013 02:35:02]  <IllFlower> Hm, if you need a fifth, maybe she received magical mentoring at some point.
[09-Aug-2013 02:35:15]  <Rig> Familiar favorite?
[09-Aug-2013 02:35:15]  <Barcode> wouldn't that go under well-read? or would this be more practical applications/soft knowledge?
[09-Aug-2013 02:35:19]  <IllFlower> She doesn't fight *for* her mentor, per se; she fights *using* the knowledge she gained from the mentor.
[09-Aug-2013 02:35:37]  <IllFlower> Barcode: It's the difference between reading books in the library and having someone teach you.
[09-Aug-2013 02:35:42]  <Barcode> m.
[09-Aug-2013 02:35:46]  <Barcode> Rig: "familiar accepts belly rubs from her 3d10"
[09-Aug-2013 02:36:19]  <Barcode> shit, now i'm thinking about the kid that came over and was giggling because my cat ran up to her to be pet.
[09-Aug-2013 02:36:22]  <Barcode> unrelated.
[09-Aug-2013 02:37:24]  <ponicalica> hmm, should I put all my d10s into "well-read"?  I think it's the one that sort of is the linchpin, so it's probably weird, but her knowledge is vast, I suppose
[09-Aug-2013 02:37:42]  <IllFlower> Mentor might also provide a focus point for her concentration when things get though.
[09-Aug-2013 02:37:45]  <IllFlower> Tough.
[09-Aug-2013 02:38:03]  <Rig> IllFlower: Are there emboys in this setting?
[09-Aug-2013 02:38:10]  <ponicalica> might want to pick the mentor instead, unsure
[09-Aug-2013 02:38:26]  <Barcode> ponicalica: You could always go 2d10 well read, 1d10 mentor.
[09-Aug-2013 02:38:29]  <Rig> ponicalica: Why not divide the d10s between the mentor and the well read.
[09-Aug-2013 02:38:32]  <IllFlower> Rig: That's a good question. Do you need an answer?
[09-Aug-2013 02:38:38]  <ponicalica> Barcode, Rig: thinking that, yeah.
[09-Aug-2013 02:38:49]  <Rig> Well, I wanted the boyfriend to be an emboy that witchified.
[09-Aug-2013 02:38:56]  <Barcode> I think that'd work. You can probably draw all three in most situations where you might need one or the otehr.
[09-Aug-2013 02:39:06]  <Barcode> and if not, you have a wider application for your D10s.
[09-Aug-2013 02:39:36]  <IllFlower> Rig: Okay, then there are. It'll probably still be a very 70/30 field of characters, though.
[09-Aug-2013 02:40:00]  <Rig> That's fine.
[09-Aug-2013 02:40:02]  <Barcode> If it's a specifically emotions-linked thing we can always play the culture card.
[09-Aug-2013 02:40:19]  <Rig> Her boyfriend was a swimming anime.
[09-Aug-2013 02:40:33]  <Barcode> "He was set Free! from the physical world. 4d4"
[09-Aug-2013 02:40:42]  <Rig> Heh.
[09-Aug-2013 02:40:47]  <ponicalica> the 2d10 well read 1d10 mentor I suppose means that the mentor was not around for long
[09-Aug-2013 02:41:00]  <Barcode> d10 is a pretty strong die.
[09-Aug-2013 02:41:02]  <Rig> Oh, and now I'm imagining witch fights set entirely underwater against a sharkboy.
[09-Aug-2013 02:41:07]  <Barcode> I mean, a gun in default rules - snerk
[09-Aug-2013 02:41:10]  <ponicalica> Barcode: it is but it's only a single die
[09-Aug-2013 02:41:16]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Or that the mentor just had less of an impact than her own dedication to self-study.
[09-Aug-2013 02:41:34]  <IllFlower> 1d10 is nothing to sneeze at.
[09-Aug-2013 02:41:47]  <ponicalica> yeah.  I was mostly speaking comparatively
[09-Aug-2013 02:41:49]  <Barcode> ponicalica: Well I mean, a gun in default rules is 1d4 + up to two other dice. A regular weapon is d6 or d8 or d6+d8.
[09-Aug-2013 02:41:59]  <ponicalica> Barcode: no d6+d8 I think?
[09-Aug-2013 02:42:11]  <Barcode> i might be forgetting. but yeah a single d10 is still pretty mean.
[09-Aug-2013 02:42:17]  <Barcode> and what IF said.
[09-Aug-2013 02:42:37]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I think we're done with traits, so let's move on to relationships.
[09-Aug-2013 02:42:41]  <Rig> Okay.
[09-Aug-2013 02:42:58]  <IllFlower> Three tops. Two is probably enough. Barcode, you may get away with only having one.
[09-Aug-2013 02:43:03]  <Barcode> m.
[09-Aug-2013 02:43:13]  <Barcode> Yeah, keep in mind you can have as many open Relationship dice as you want, and then assign them in-play as you please.
[09-Aug-2013 02:44:15]  <Barcode> How does my character's only real fixed point through the years being her Familiar sound? I mean, she can have friends and stuff but they don't necessarily have to be em-important.
[09-Aug-2013 02:44:45]  <IllFlower> Do you think she would fight for the sake of her familiar?
[09-Aug-2013 02:44:50]  <Barcode> oh right. hm.
[09-Aug-2013 02:45:14]  <Barcode> well, can't Relationships also just be people/relationships you can use in a conflict? The manual says you can pick Some Guy Off the Street and stuff.
[09-Aug-2013 02:45:20]  <IllFlower> It could be a "fight for revenge" thing. d8 would say that the desire for revenge propels her.
[09-Aug-2013 02:45:31]  <IllFlower> So the relationship would be with whomever she wants revenge against.
[09-Aug-2013 02:45:34]  <Barcode> oh, you mean like, confrontational - m.
[09-Aug-2013 02:46:05]  <IllFlower> The random guy off the street has to have had some kind of explicable impact, though.
[09-Aug-2013 02:46:23]  <Barcode> Yeah; I just meant like, as far as the nature of the Relationship's relevance goes, i guess.
[09-Aug-2013 02:46:32]  <IllFlower> Like "seeing a child suffering in the street inspired me to take up arms d8."
[09-Aug-2013 02:47:28]  <ponicalica> so a d4 relationship is one that would inspire you to fight, but in a complicated way?
[09-Aug-2013 02:47:37]  <Barcode> Or even in a way that gets you in trouble.
[09-Aug-2013 02:47:59]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Yeah, d4 relationships are more handicap than help.
[09-Aug-2013 02:48:15]  <IllFlower> e.g. Rig's character has a dead boyfriend that brings up traumatic memories, thus 2d4.
[09-Aug-2013 02:50:06]  <Barcode> oh, I have an idea, which is sort of backstory-y. She lived in a witch area growing up, didn't know anything about witch influence. Lost a lot of friends through what was pretty much inexplicable relationship problems. [Was much less affected by the witches thanks to being a good candidate for emgirlism?,] was then extended contract by familiar [under a promise to fix things once she defeated the 
[09-Aug-2013 02:50:06]  <Barcode> witch?]
[09-Aug-2013 02:50:40]  <ponicalica> rig has ten dice, barc has seven, I have six; I probably only need to think of one relationship beyond the conservators themselves
[09-Aug-2013 02:50:41]  <Barcode> maybe things didn't fully work out with a lot of her friends because she herself had become much more confrontational under the duress, outside of witch influence.
[09-Aug-2013 02:50:54]  <Barcode> didn't fully work out afterwards* So like, she's bitter, but she understands.
[09-Aug-2013 02:50:57]  <Rig> Okay, I have two relationships, but I should probably assign some more. Any thoughts?
[09-Aug-2013 02:51:06]  <Barcode> and i guess i'd pick some particular person she lost contact with for that.
[09-Aug-2013 02:51:19]  <Rig> Maybe I can give IllFlower some fodder to throw at me by making up some other old emgirls that my character worked with.
[09-Aug-2013 02:51:26]  <IllFlower> Barcode: Just remember to think of it in terms of one person or group of people that motivates her to fight.
[09-Aug-2013 02:52:02]  * Barcode types up something along those lines.
[09-Aug-2013 02:52:04]  <IllFlower> Rig: Your character might have a thing for the non-magical. Innocents in the line of fire.
[09-Aug-2013 02:52:39]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Maybe your character has a rival, haha.
[09-Aug-2013 02:52:53]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Or someone she's seeking the approval of.

[09-Aug-2013 03:08:54]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: alright.  pinning down details
[09-Aug-2013 03:09:05]  <IllFlower> You don't have to flesh out the details too much. The basic nature of the relationship is enough for now.
[09-Aug-2013 03:09:21]  <Barcode> IllFlower: Well, I like the idea that she's sorta nostalgic for when things were going well between her and her friends. She has a hard time being as nice as she used to be but when she was she used to reliably find healthy company.
[09-Aug-2013 03:09:46]  <IllFlower> I feel like 1d8 ought to be enough.
[09-Aug-2013 03:09:49]  <Barcode> Arright.
[09-Aug-2013 03:10:03]  <IllFlower> 2d8 seems like something that actively, consistently drives her.
[09-Aug-2013 03:10:30]  <Barcode> Mhm. I'm fine with its strength, i just was afraid it was going to be too elaborate to justify the meager die.
[09-Aug-2013 03:10:41]  <Barcode> Then again, the manual has "my brother, who i've always cherished and looked up to, that i've known all my life d4"
[09-Aug-2013 03:11:36]  <IllFlower> "... and the memory of whom makes me pine for home, and distracts me from my calling."
[09-Aug-2013 03:12:27]  <Alicia> Barcod's character is my favorite so far.
[09-Aug-2013 03:12:27]  <IllFlower> Barcode, ponicalica, Rig: Okay, I think we're done with relationships. Shall we conclude with belongings?
[09-Aug-2013 03:12:44]  <ponicalica> yeah, I think so
[09-Aug-2013 03:14:12]  <IllFlower> Remember that guns become magically imbued objects. Wands, amulets, whatever.
[09-Aug-2013 03:14:52]  <Barcode> mhm. :>
[09-Aug-2013 03:16:19]  <IllFlower> For now the most important thing about the costume is to describe the state it's in. 2d6 by default, though it may be modulated higher or lower for experience.
[09-Aug-2013 03:16:31]  <Barcode> oh, costumes are Excellent by defualt?
[09-Aug-2013 03:16:43]  <Barcode> or coats are 2d6 by default and i'm dumb
[09-Aug-2013 03:17:09]  <IllFlower> Well, in stock Dogs, they're 2d6 to reflect the excellence of the coat, symbolically and often physically.
[09-Aug-2013 03:17:14]  <Barcode> Ah.
[09-Aug-2013 03:17:29]  <Barcode> So even for those guys who had like, a crest sewn on haphazardly and stuff, it counts, i assume.
[09-Aug-2013 03:18:08]  <IllFlower> Right. It's also reflective of the community you grew up in.
[09-Aug-2013 03:18:16]  <ponicalica> hmmm
[09-Aug-2013 03:18:37]  <Barcode> oh, ponicalica and I were discussing, could the weapon be something we keep on our person that /becomes/ the weapon when we transform?
[09-Aug-2013 03:18:43]  <Barcode> discussing a few days/weeks back*
[09-Aug-2013 03:18:57]  <IllFlower> In this case, it'd be the magical community. One's magical comrades don't directly sew the costume together, of course, but to mirror standard Dogs, the costume takes on the qualities of one's magical surroundings.
[09-Aug-2013 03:19:27]  <IllFlower> Barcode: Depends on the specific object, of course, but generally yes.
[09-Aug-2013 03:19:33]  <Barcode> hmm.
[09-Aug-2013 03:20:00]  <Barcode> yeah i was gonna have my weapon be a self-defense baton that becomes the magical weapon post-transformation, but then using it in non-magic combat gets weird.
[09-Aug-2013 03:20:16]  <Barcode> though i guess any kind of dual-use item would be weird, mechanically...

[09-Aug-2013 03:28:51]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: I was thinking about replacing it with holy water, but either way I don't think we considered the dirt important enough to place as a belonging in the last campaign we ran.

[09-Aug-2013 03:29:20]  <Rig> Yeah, the last Dogs campaign my characters most important belonging was his Book of Life.
[09-Aug-2013 03:29:31]  <Barcode> oh! can we have rune-drawing asa sort of ceremony thing?
[09-Aug-2013 03:29:36]  <Rig> I just wanted some belongings to provide outside depth to my character.

[09-Aug-2013 03:31:55]  * Barcode forgets characters Are Girls. maybe just keep a cheap lipstick thing around
[09-Aug-2013 03:31:56]  <IllFlower> You could just go for drawing them in the air.

[09-Aug-2013 03:32:49]  <Barcode> Heh, it could be fancy. I just had this idea (back when we had dirt) that i'd be like, tracing some rune onto the ground as part of some exorcism or something.
[09-Aug-2013 03:33:32]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Gotta make your character a bit less ascetic. :p
[09-Aug-2013 03:34:04]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: yeah, just, you know, considering things
[09-Aug-2013 03:34:22]  <IllFlower> Barcode: As long as you can make a convincing case that what you're doing maps to an Element of Ceremony in the original game, I'm a-okay with it.

[09-Aug-2013 03:45:52]  <IllFlower> Literally "shield."
[09-Aug-2013 03:46:04]  <Rig> Works for me.
[09-Aug-2013 03:46:20]  <Rig> I'm almost certain I'm pronouncing it wrong in my head.
[09-Aug-2013 03:46:34]  <ponicalica> Rig: like "June" would be my guess
[09-Aug-2013 03:47:18]  <IllFlower> You wouldn't literally use that character, usually, but there are lots of names pronounced that way. That and Junko, Junna, etc.
[09-Aug-2013 03:47:33]  <ponicalica> should I make the notebook 1d6 or 2d6?

[09-Aug-2013 03:50:06]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: d6 if it's normal, 2d6 if it's something people would comment on unprompted when they see it.

[09-Aug-2013 03:50:31]  <Barcode> A torch and a lighter, though?
[09-Aug-2013 03:50:32]  <Rig> Or even better, a can of spray paint.

[09-Aug-2013 04:03:33]  <Rig> I am satisfied with this character that has been created.
[09-Aug-2013 04:03:51]  <Barcode> i'm trying to decide if this is going to be a Giger Ballgown or if I want Theron Guard-like leggings.
[09-Aug-2013 04:03:51]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: You're free until then, or not free until then?

[09-Aug-2013 04:04:52]  <Rig> Barcode: When I read leggings I pictured… something else.
[09-Aug-2013 04:04:58]  <Barcode> :]
[09-Aug-2013 04:04:58]  <IllFlower> Okay, how does sometime around 4:00 or 5:00 ET sound?
[09-Aug-2013 04:05:02]  <Rig> Sounds good.
[09-Aug-2013 04:05:07]  <Barcode> I can - shit, hold on
[09-Aug-2013 04:05:43]  <Barcode> Rig: If you have other, more traditionally fantasy ideas, please dump them becuase fuck if I know much female armor.
[09-Aug-2013 04:05:49]  <Nitya> giger ballgown <-- suddenly, i'm paying attention

[09-Aug-2013 04:06:23]  <Barcode> maybe.
[09-Aug-2013 04:06:32]  <Barcode> Rig: i meant leggings, though. i totally like how the torso works here.
[09-Aug-2013 04:06:36]  <Barcode> just, maybe i would have a shorter skirt, plus leggings.
[09-Aug-2013 04:07:07]  <Nitya> oh, is that... whatshername
[09-Aug-2013 04:07:15]  <Nitya> the drf head or w/e
[09-Aug-2013 04:07:19]  <Barcode> think so.
[09-Aug-2013 04:07:23]  <Barcode> haven't opened volume 3 yet.
[09-Aug-2013 04:07:32]  <Rig> Well, if you want like an armored skirt with leggings that makes sense.
[09-Aug-2013 04:07:39]  <Barcode> Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[09-Aug-2013 04:07:47]  <Rig> But armored leggings are… well, all I see is chain fishnets.
[09-Aug-2013 04:07:47]  <Barcode> but i need to see it, i think...
[09-Aug-2013 04:07:50]  <Rig> And that's a no.
[09-Aug-2013 04:07:52]  <Barcode> heehee
[09-Aug-2013 04:08:06]  <Barcode> oh, leggings
[09-Aug-2013 04:08:14]  <Barcode> i keep using that term. greaves, whatever the fuck. medieval, let's go wtih that
[09-Aug-2013 04:08:19]  <Rig> Okay, yeah.

[09-Aug-2013 04:08:53]  <Barcode> IllFlower: oh, sorry, yeah. Physio starts at 2:30, but if I'm quick I'll finish for 4. i'll get home slightly later, though.
[09-Aug-2013 04:08:56]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: that should be fine.  That'd be 1-2 PT, yeah?

[09-Aug-2013 04:10:03]  <ponicalica> Barcode: it was what, three hours?
[09-Aug-2013 04:10:13]  <IllFlower> Tomorrow should be more straightforward. Come up with initiation stakes, run conflict.

[09-Aug-2013 04:10:54]  <IllFlower> For reference, last time we did initiations they took about an hour apiece.
[09-Aug-2013 04:10:55]  <Rig> Well, I just searched for kusazuri.
[09-Aug-2013 04:11:03]  * Barcode glances.
[09-Aug-2013 04:11:19]  <Rig> It's the fauld bit of samurai armor.
