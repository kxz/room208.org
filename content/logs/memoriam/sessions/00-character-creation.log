@time=2013-08-09T00:51:12.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was imagining that the community thing would be something you are still involved in to some extent.
@time=2013-08-09T00:51:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mechanics-wise, the difference betweent he two is that Community carries more Relationship dice, while History carries more Trait dice.
@time=2013-08-09T00:52:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So I suppose Community is more for if interactions with specific people define the character, while History is about experiences.

@time=2013-08-09T00:53:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So Rig, if the "dead boyfriend" thing is something that your character has trouble with, I could see it being a d4 relationship.
