@time=2014-03-08T05:16:13.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was thinking also, like 1d4 worried about initiative but that's kind of long, for one. First she wasn't strong enough to help with Jun, then she juust manages to fend off these folks with Ayako, but can't really do much beyond that.
@time=2014-03-08T05:16:24.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or that. That makes more sense.
@time=2014-03-08T05:16:46.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So 1d8 to 1d4?
@time=2014-03-08T05:16:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :1d6.
@time=2014-03-08T05:17:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just one die size is enough.
@time=2014-03-08T05:17:10.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ACTION got confused.
@time=2014-03-08T05:17:12.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Right.
@time=2014-03-08T05:18:26.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, then I gotta say the thing.
@time=2014-03-08T05:19:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, changed.
@time=2014-03-08T05:19:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So Hikari should probably answer the poor girl's question.
@time=2014-03-08T05:19:34.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari holds her position steady, glancing back at the girl. "Information, now. What are you attacking Shirakawa for, and just what are you planning at?"
@time=2014-03-08T05:20:27.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Answer them *peacefully* too, please." she finishes, focus waning.
@time=2014-03-08T05:20:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We know she's after the chief."
@time=2014-03-08T05:20:46.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Of?"
@time=2014-03-08T05:22:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The girl extends her hand out towards Ayako and Hikari, opening her fingers to reveal her palm.
@time=2014-03-08T05:22:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In black ink on the folds of her skin is that unmistakable torch mark.
@time=2014-03-08T05:23:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Does that answer your question?"
@time=2014-03-08T05:25:36.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Wouldn't that be Osada. Or.)
@time=2014-03-08T05:25:49.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness : Hiiragi: Rolled 2 3 7 = 12.
@time=2014-03-08T05:26:01.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :...? Uh, sorry.
@time=2014-03-08T05:26:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes, it would be.
@time=2014-03-08T05:26:21.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ACTION was wiping something off of the touchpad for computer and did a thing.
@time=2014-03-08T05:27:01.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What do you have to tell us about Osada and her plans?"
@time=2014-03-08T05:27:07.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or, wait no.
@time=2014-03-08T05:27:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's not a very useful question considering Mai told the Conservators everything about that already.
@time=2014-03-08T05:27:42.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(We know, but I was thinking like straining out more. All we know is crap's going down.)
@time=2014-03-08T05:27:45.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.
@time=2014-03-08T05:27:53.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hm.
@time=2014-03-08T05:27:54.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica?
@time=2014-03-08T05:28:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mai didn't mention anything about going after Satsuki, though. That's new. Possibly wrong.
@time=2014-03-08T05:29:00.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"How do you know she's going after her?"
@time=2014-03-08T05:30:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We heard it from the chief herself," the boy chimes in. "She's been on the list for a while now."
@time=2014-03-08T05:30:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mai laughs derisively.
@time=2014-03-08T05:31:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That girl's not worth my time," Mai says. "Though what that other girl said isn't totally wrong. It's true I wouldn't care if she were to drop dead tomorrow."
@time=2014-03-08T05:31:51.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness : Hiiragi: Rolled 2 3 7 = 12.
@time=2014-03-08T05:32:04.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(SORRY.)
@time=2014-03-08T05:32:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You should probably turn off click-to-paste.
@time=2014-03-08T05:33:00.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes.
@time=2014-03-08T05:33:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Like any of us would believe someone who's getting taken away by the Conservators," the boy retorts.
@time=2014-03-08T05:36:06.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"So who all is on the list?  Just Emi's associates?"
@time=2014-03-08T05:37:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"They all deserve to be on it."
@time=2014-03-08T05:38:55.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"For what?  What have they all done that they deserve to die, outside of the Order's law?"
@time=2014-03-08T05:40:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"They've done enough."
@time=2014-03-08T05:40:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The boy glares at Ayako, unfazed.
@time=2014-03-08T05:41:28.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari glares down at the boy, tightening her grip. "Please, keep the clever remarks to yourself. And that hasn't answered our question. What did they do?"
@time=2014-03-08T05:41:42.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(As if they'll answer. >:/)
@time=2014-03-08T05:44:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :They won't. All the answer the Conservators need, they've gotten from Mai already.
@time=2014-03-08T05:44:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It really is that petty.
@time=2014-03-08T05:44:38.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What a bunch of tools.
@time=2014-03-08T05:45:13.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica, think Ayako and Hikari are done here, or do you have anything else to say?
@time=2014-03-08T05:45:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Class warfare, my friend.
@time=2014-03-08T05:45:55.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hiiragi: Yeah, I think at this point, we should just take Mai in.
@time=2014-03-08T05:46:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What about the people who were just trying to kill her?
@time=2014-03-08T05:47:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And, hey, what happened to immunity?
@time=2014-03-08T05:48:42.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She'll be safer in Conservator custody?
@time=2014-03-08T05:48:43.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was trying to make Ayako non-committal about that.  Also, you know, she's lying about her non-involvement
@time=2014-03-08T05:49:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There's a good chance Satsuki was lying.
@time=2014-03-08T05:49:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You can't really take anyone at face value.
@time=2014-03-08T05:51:19.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, but even Mai suggested that Satsuki's group was only going after Emi's, so...
@time=2014-03-08T05:51:35.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :and yet she built a cube fortress
@time=2014-03-08T05:52:05.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari sighs. "Thank you for your time." Then, exasperated, directs the three attackers elsewhere. "Now please leave. We will deal as we see fit from here."
@time=2014-03-08T05:52:40.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(I mean, they aren't really going to cough up anything else. And with them gone we can "deal" with Mai, I figure.)
@time=2014-03-08T05:53:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I really do question the wisdom of letting three initiates who essentially confessed to attempted murder go.
@time=2014-03-08T05:53:47.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hm.
@time=2014-03-08T05:53:50.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Take'em all in.
@time=2014-03-08T05:54:02.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alt: Knock them out, and then take them in.
@time=2014-03-08T05:54:18.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Have Ayako blind them with her light.
@time=2014-03-08T05:54:22.000Z :Saladofstones QUIT :Quit: Stones Has It
@time=2014-03-08T05:54:26.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: The question is how receptive would they be?  I mean, we fought them down, but for information, not arrest.
@time=2014-03-08T05:55:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Abandoning prosecution because of effort.gif doesn't sound very Conservator-like to me!
@time=2014-03-08T05:55:58.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We can force something out. Blind'em and then I will handle them.
@time=2014-03-08T05:56:13.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14imo, beat them death for resisting arrest and call it good
@time=2014-03-08T05:56:35.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Nitya, Nitya, Hikari has no reason for that *yet*.
@time=2014-03-08T05:56:50.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14some cops you are.
@time=2014-03-08T05:56:56.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14wow.
@time=2014-03-08T05:57:31.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Do you really expect that out of Hikari!?
@time=2014-03-08T05:57:37.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let alone Ayako.
@time=2014-03-08T05:58:17.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: If you want to, but I mean, I think my idea is good too.
@time=2014-03-08T05:59:26.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :heh.  Either way, I think if we're going to do something that IllFlower isn't going to automatic to, we should do it next session, because it's been about six hours
@time=2014-03-08T05:59:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Only five and a half!
@time=2014-03-08T05:59:45.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Agreed.
@time=2014-03-08T05:59:49.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :^^;
@time=2014-03-08T06:00:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, we'll call it quits for tonight, then. Ayako and Hikari can make up their minds next time.
@time=2014-03-08T06:00:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for playing, you two. We'll be back soon.
