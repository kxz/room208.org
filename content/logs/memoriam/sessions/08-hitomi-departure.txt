[12-Jan-2014 02:06:10]  <IllFlower> So I figure we'll pick up in the hospital, a few days after the events of the last session.
[12-Jan-2014 02:06:12]  <Alicia> The i in Rig and an i in Alicia.
[12-Jan-2014 02:06:37]  <Barcode> Hitomi's around, I assume?
[12-Jan-2014 02:06:54]  <Rig> Jun is still wrapped in bandages and looking worse for wear.
[12-Jan-2014 02:07:13]  <IllFlower> Ayako's been discharged.
[12-Jan-2014 02:07:28]  <IllFlower> Jun doesn't look all that great, but she's on her way out of convalescence.
[12-Jan-2014 02:08:00]  <IllFlower> I'm going to say Shii's called a meeting of the Conservators present.
[12-Jan-2014 02:08:13]  <IllFlower> Alicia: That includes Hikari.
[12-Jan-2014 02:08:19]  <Alicia> Ah, noted.
[12-Jan-2014 02:08:24]  *** Alicia is now known as Hiiragi
[12-Jan-2014 02:09:10]  <IllFlower> Shii sits perched on top of a tall stool. Jun's in the bed, while the other three sit in a loose circle of chairs.
[12-Jan-2014 02:09:43]  <Barcode> iGes I do this, then.
[12-Jan-2014 02:09:44]  *** Barcode is now known as Barcode[Hitomi]
[12-Jan-2014 02:09:47]  <IllFlower> It's mid-morning; the sun filters through the room's curtains.
[12-Jan-2014 02:09:58]  <IllFlower> "How are you feeling, Jun?" **
[12-Jan-2014 02:11:02]  <Rig> Jun shrugs and winces. "Things have been better, Shii." Jun eyes flick across to the girl new girl sitting in the circle then back to her familiar, questioning.
[12-Jan-2014 02:11:38]  <ponicalica> "Sorry I couldn't've gotten to you faster."
[12-Jan-2014 02:11:43]  <Rig> strike that first "girl" btw
[12-Jan-2014 02:11:56]  * IllFlower kills off a random female character
[12-Jan-2014 02:12:02]  <Rig> Excellent.
[12-Jan-2014 02:12:07]  <Rig> Completely in character.
[12-Jan-2014 02:12:32]  <ponicalica> hopefully not one of the PCs
[12-Jan-2014 02:12:45]  <Rig> "It's fine, Ayako," Jun says. "Lots of things went wrong."
[12-Jan-2014 02:13:38]  <IllFlower> The atmosphere is... a little awkward.
[12-Jan-2014 02:13:40]  * Hiiragi eyes Jun tensely, going through the multitude of possibilities that could have brought Jun to where she is now. Her eyes ease across the room, sizing up the other girls.
[12-Jan-2014 02:13:44]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> Hitomi sits with her arms on her lap, pointedly staring at some point to the left of Shii.
[12-Jan-2014 02:13:45]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@181.135.166.243> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 207 seconds)
[12-Jan-2014 02:13:55]  <IllFlower> You'd hardly expect anything else from the first meeting after Jun's awakening, one supposes.
[12-Jan-2014 02:14:25]  <IllFlower> After a few seconds of silence, Shii picks up hesitantly.
[12-Jan-2014 02:15:38]  <IllFlower> "I'm sorry this happened to you. I have to be the one to take responsibility for sending you into that situation without adequate preparation. You were only caught off guard because of my negligence."
[12-Jan-2014 02:16:00]  <IllFlower> Shii pauses for a moment.
[12-Jan-2014 02:16:13]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@181.135.39.152> has joined #madokamadness
[12-Jan-2014 02:16:27]  <IllFlower> "I know mere apologies can't heal those burns, though." **

[12-Jan-2014 02:17:45]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> Rig: well, with quotation marks it gets a little more "wait, did you mean it", kinda.

[12-Jan-2014 02:18:16]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> anyway. Hitomi continues to keep her attention away from those present.
[12-Jan-2014 02:18:34]  <IllFlower> "Anyway," Shii picks up, seeing that nobody has much to say, "I know this is hardly a good time to deliver news of any sort, but time waits for no one.

[12-Jan-2014 02:20:50]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi?
[12-Jan-2014 02:21:01]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> Hitomi glances sideways at the new girl. Away again before she can turn her attention to Hitomi.
[12-Jan-2014 02:21:58]  <ponicalica> to herself?
[12-Jan-2014 02:22:10]  * Hiiragi scans the room, focusing briefly on Shii before turning around to face everyone. "Hello… everyone. Shii cut to the chase nicely, so I guess I don't have much to say. How did you all get here?"
[12-Jan-2014 02:22:12]  <Rig> I think he meant Hiiragi turning her attention to Hitomi.
[12-Jan-2014 02:22:19]  <ponicalica> oh, lol
[12-Jan-2014 02:22:26]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> ponicalica: Yeah, like, one of those glances where you can tell someone's looking at you but when you actually check, they're not.
[12-Jan-2014 02:22:41]  <Rig> Jun grimaces at the question of how they got here.
[12-Jan-2014 02:23:00]  <IllFlower> Someone might want to prompt Hikari for her name, haha.
[12-Jan-2014 02:23:07]  <ponicalica> "Hi, uh, what was your name again?"
[12-Jan-2014 02:23:11]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> well done.
[12-Jan-2014 02:23:36]  <ponicalica> I was actually writing something that had Hikari's name in it but then realized that we probably wouldn't know it yet unless Shii had informed us before.
[12-Jan-2014 02:24:08]  <ponicalica> Ayako stutters.  She's still not used to meeting new people very often.
[12-Jan-2014 02:24:15]  * Hiiragi glances at Jun, pursing her lips, then focuses back on everyone. "I'm Hikari, as Shii said, the newest Conservator in our little… group."
[12-Jan-2014 02:24:39]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> Hitomi remains impassive.
[12-Jan-2014 02:24:47]  <IllFlower> An anguished expression crosses Shii's face, seeming to say "I had a feeling this would happen."
[12-Jan-2014 02:24:51]  <Rig> "Doesn't seem so little," Jun says under her breath, her eyes on Shii.
[12-Jan-2014 02:25:49]  <IllFlower> Shii looks back at Jun, recoiling somewhat at the girl's seeming hostility.

[12-Jan-2014 02:27:18]  <IllFlower> "Hikari's been the sentry of sorts here over the past few days. We wanted to avoid any possibility of someone taking advantage of your incapacitation." **
[12-Jan-2014 02:27:57]  <IllFlower> Shii indicates Ayako and Jun. Her head starts moving toward Hitomi, then stops. **
[12-Jan-2014 02:28:17]  * Hiiragi smiles, looking at everyone once more. "I can tell you all are good people. You have my word that nothing will befall, as long as I can help it."
[12-Jan-2014 02:28:36]  <Rig> "I appreciate the watchful eyes, miss."
[12-Jan-2014 02:29:50]  * Hiiragi glances over, mouth widening "Of course… it's simply the least I could do." Her mouth tenses into a line "But, please… it's much too tense in here, feel free to ask me anything, if you wish."
[12-Jan-2014 02:30:33]  * Hiiragi continues "If not, I suppose there is some reason Shii's called us all here, aside from my introduction."

[12-Jan-2014 02:32:11]  <Hiiragi> "Well, I assume you mean as a watchdog? If not, no, I volunteered after Shii mentioned Jun's state."
[12-Jan-2014 02:32:35]  <ponicalica> "Am I still being watched?"
[12-Jan-2014 02:32:41]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> Hitomi raises her eyebrows briefly in acknowledgement, still looking elsewhere.
[12-Jan-2014 02:33:52]  <IllFlower> "It's as Hikari said," Shii confirms. "Well, technically, at first she was just 'on loan' to me from another familiar, but she's since been transferred to my care. To make up for, um..." Shii hesitates again. **

[12-Jan-2014 02:35:12]  <Rig> Jun raises her eyebrows as Shii hesitates. What could possibly be so embarrassing for the little one.
[12-Jan-2014 02:35:21]  * Hiiragi tries to chuckle a bir "No need to get into that, I think? It was one little case, Shii, and everything is fine now. Well, as fine as you *can* be as… us."

[12-Jan-2014 02:37:04]  <IllFlower> "I would say," Shii continues, "but I think it's better if you hear it from the person in question."
[12-Jan-2014 02:37:18]  <IllFlower> She indicates Hitomi, who's been rather aloof so far, with a nod of her head.

[12-Jan-2014 02:44:07]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> After an uncomfortable pause - one which she seems to spend grimacing, she begins. "As of today I'm resigning from Conservator duties."

[12-Jan-2014 02:44:57]  <IllFlower> (Screen cuts into three vertical strips, each with a different character going "D:")

[12-Jan-2014 02:45:50]  <Rig> Jun stares at her hands, which are folded neatly in her lap.
[12-Jan-2014 02:46:54]  * Hiiragi pales, blinking. "You're… resigning? Is that… what had to have happened?" Hikari focuses on Hitomi, perplexed.

[12-Jan-2014 02:51:24]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> Hitomi practically ignores the inquiries. Becomes a bit more assertive with her tone. "I always told myself that it doesn't matter what I hear out in the field. Beating down the upstarts was more important than their little projects and ideas of how *we* should run. And guess what?

[12-Jan-2014 02:58:11]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> Hitomi stands to leave. "Ayako, Jun, I'm sorry. Hopefully Hikari here can keep her head screwed on straight better than I did."

[12-Jan-2014 03:00:01]  <ponicalica> Ayako falls completely silent.  Dealing with the issues of other initiates was hard enough, much less her colleagues and friends.
[12-Jan-2014 03:01:42]  * Hiiragi lightly shakes her head, before gritting her teeth and standing up. "Hitomi, please. This won't make it any easier for you, or any of your friends. I may not know *everything*, but after… what happened, please tell me, how can you think that *leaving* is the best idea?"
[12-Jan-2014 03:03:21]  <IllFlower> Wow, Hitomi's getting upbraided from every corner.

[12-Jan-2014 03:05:42]  * Hiiragi draws in a breath, relaxing. "You're not to *blame* for not pulling through even when you tried your hardest. Being a Conservator is risky business, we all know that."
[12-Jan-2014 03:06:04]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> "Jun, I already have," Hitomi manages, before Hiiragi starts. She turns, annoyed, towards the newcomer.

[12-Jan-2014 03:21:32]  * Hiiragi swallows, looking around before turning back to Hitomi. "Just stay well, at least for Jun and Ayako. Please."
[12-Jan-2014 03:21:36]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> "Ayako, it was not your dedication to the Order that failed us. Plus, you're new. You have an excuse."
[12-Jan-2014 03:22:27]  <Rig> ((Shit, Jun was cool as hell in that fight.))
[12-Jan-2014 03:22:37]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> ((i didn't even get to meteor hammer anything :(  ))
[12-Jan-2014 03:22:42]  <ponicalica> ((She was  Too bad she was doomed.))
[12-Jan-2014 03:23:59]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> Hitomi shoots a glare at Hiiragi. At least Ayako had been through actual combat..! "My colleagues are better off without me."

[12-Jan-2014 03:25:02]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> ((that middle sentence can probably go away. i basically wanted to indicate hitomi at least sees some merit in ayako for, well, doing more than hitomi did in that little campaign))
[12-Jan-2014 03:25:15]  <IllFlower> "Okay, stop, stop, stop," Shii interrupts, rather forcefully. "Please stop."
[12-Jan-2014 03:25:19]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> ((being The New Guy but actually having demonstrably done something, I mean.))
[12-Jan-2014 03:25:28]  <IllFlower> Shii looks at each of the girls in turn.
[12-Jan-2014 03:26:19]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> Hitomi eases off, still agitated. 
[12-Jan-2014 03:27:05]  * Hiiragi backs away, giving Hitomi her space.
[12-Jan-2014 03:27:07]  <IllFlower> "Hitomi's consulted me already. Even if I had the power to keep her from resigning, I wouldn't. It's clear that she doesn't see herself in the position, and I can't very well have her risk her life in that case.
[12-Jan-2014 03:27:16]  <IllFlower> "Or any of yours, really.

[12-Jan-2014 03:29:43]  <IllFlower> "Hikari, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I can't imagine that words alone will persuade Hitomi.

[12-Jan-2014 03:30:43]  <IllFlower> "And Hitomi, there's no need to be so harsh. You may not think you'll need them anymore, but it's still a bad idea to burn those bridges."
[12-Jan-2014 03:31:26]  <IllFlower> Shii sighs. "Let us at least say our farewells in peace." **
[12-Jan-2014 03:32:22]  <Rig> "Goodbye, Hitomi. I hope you find what you're looking for elsewhere." Jun says, her eyes still closed.
[12-Jan-2014 03:37:17]  <IllFlower> ("The rest of the room just broods in silence.")
[12-Jan-2014 03:37:27]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> ((Yeah, i was gonna say. got a leaving line ready if yall are done))
[12-Jan-2014 03:38:01]  <Rig> **
[12-Jan-2014 03:38:12]  <IllFlower> lol.
[12-Jan-2014 03:38:14]  <ponicalica> "Goodbye, Hitomi.  Good, uh, luck..."
[12-Jan-2014 03:38:47]  <Hiiragi> "You're… right. I'm sorry Hitomi, but…" She hesitates, before looking back. "May you live well, Hitomi. I will do what I can for your friends." She gets out after some effort, mustering a faint smile.
[12-Jan-2014 03:39:03]  <Hiiragi> (Ack, she she. Tried with transitions. I'm tryiiing.)
[12-Jan-2014 03:39:26]  <ponicalica> don't worry about the prose being perfect or whatever
[12-Jan-2014 03:39:33]  <ponicalica> just look at any of my lines for instance :P
[12-Jan-2014 03:39:48]  <Hiiragi> (Right.)
[12-Jan-2014 03:40:12]  <ponicalica> (well, there were a couple of my lines that still rock)
[12-Jan-2014 03:40:32]  <Hiiragi> (**)
[12-Jan-2014 03:40:54]  <ponicalica> (also yeah ** here too)
[12-Jan-2014 03:40:57]  <IllFlower> Barcode[Hitomi]: Whenever you're ready.
[12-Jan-2014 03:41:07]  <IllFlower> I think Shii will probably follow Hitomi out the door.
[12-Jan-2014 03:41:27]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> Hitomi softens. It's nothing she has against them, after all. She might as well leave them pleasantly. "Good luck out there, Hikari. And goodbye to you all. As laughable as the prospect is, I wish you all less hardship in the future." Hitomi turns and walks out into the hallway, procuring another cigarette as she heads to the ground floor.
[12-Jan-2014 03:41:28]  <IllFlower> Gotta make sure that badge gets turned in, y'know.
[12-Jan-2014 03:41:40]  <Barcode[Hitomi]> ((shii can, of course, follow.))
[12-Jan-2014 03:42:27]  *** Barcode[Hitomi] is now known as Barcode
[12-Jan-2014 03:43:05]  <Rig> ((You can't smoke in a hospital))
[12-Jan-2014 03:43:06]  <IllFlower> Shii nods to the three remaining Conservators. "I'm going to make sure everything gets straightened away for her departure. This meeting is adjourned.
[12-Jan-2014 03:43:23]  <Barcode> ((rig: Hitomi runs down the hallways, setting off fire alarms and flipping off the nurses in each room.))
[12-Jan-2014 03:43:25]  <IllFlower> "I'll see you soon." **
[12-Jan-2014 03:43:45]  <Barcode> (((it's more just she has it in her hand, ready for when she steps out the door)))
[12-Jan-2014 03:44:01]  <IllFlower> Rig: As if she cares, haha.
[12-Jan-2014 03:44:21]  <Rig> I liked that little exchange. It was good, Barcode.
[12-Jan-2014 03:44:27]  <IllFlower> I imagine that scene from Flight with the three people in the stairwell smoking.
[12-Jan-2014 03:44:36]  <Hiiragi> (Flight?)
[12-Jan-2014 03:44:37]  <Rig> I still need to see Flight.
[12-Jan-2014 03:44:41]  <Barcode> HITOMI WAS DRUNK! TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY, SHE WAS DRUNK
[12-Jan-2014 03:44:42]  <Rig> @g imdb Flight
[12-Jan-2014 03:44:42]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Google: (1/4) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1907668/ — Flight (2012) - IMDb: Directed by Robert Zemeckis. With Denzel Washington, Nadine Velazquez, Don Cheadle, John Goodman. An airline pilot saves almost all his passengers on ... (+628 more characters)
[12-Jan-2014 03:44:52]  <Barcode> SHE'S DRUNK RIGHT NOW
[12-Jan-2014 03:44:57]  <IllFlower> Barcode: bahahaha.
[12-Jan-2014 03:45:05]  <Hiiragi> (Ah.)
[12-Jan-2014 03:45:30]  <ponicalica> (I don't get it :V)
[12-Jan-2014 03:45:34]  <Barcode> ((movie linez))
[12-Jan-2014 03:45:53]  <Barcode> ((anyway, thx rig. i tried. i do try quite hard all the time and i think that's why it's so hard for me to RP for any extended period of time >_<))
[12-Jan-2014 03:46:00]  <IllFlower> So, I imagine Ayako, Jun, and Hikari can take some time to awkwardly chat...
[12-Jan-2014 03:46:17]  <Barcode> ((amongst other things. anayway! yeah! HF and thanks for the proper outro, flour.))
[12-Jan-2014 03:46:20]  <IllFlower> I have one more thing I'd like to get to, but a brief opportunity for extemp is never bad.
[12-Jan-2014 03:46:48]  <ponicalica> "So, uh, Hikari, was it?"
[12-Jan-2014 03:47:15]  <Rig> Jun raises her hand "Hang on, Ayako."
[12-Jan-2014 03:47:30]  <Rig> IllFlower: Shii left?
[12-Jan-2014 03:47:33]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[12-Jan-2014 03:47:42]  <IllFlower> Is this where I put on my yuri goggles? Haven lent me a pair.
[12-Jan-2014 03:47:46]  * Hiiragi sits down, adjusting her chair so as to face Jun and Ayako. "Yes, Hikari. What is it—"
[12-Jan-2014 03:48:00]  <Barcode> hiiragi notices the DM's goggles.
[12-Jan-2014 03:48:39]  <Hiiragi> (!!!)
[12-Jan-2014 03:48:55]  <Rig> "Our last mission went less than exemplary. Things got fucked up, Hiigari. This will not be easy. Hitomi was the most badass girl I knew, and she just walked out."
[12-Jan-2014 03:49:36]  <ponicalica> (Hiigari: the natural result of Hikari Hiiragi's tongue-twister name)
[12-Jan-2014 03:50:00]  <Rig> "I want you to know right now, that if you're not up for this you should follow her. Otherwise...."
[12-Jan-2014 03:50:06]  <Rig> Jun slouches back in her bed.
[12-Jan-2014 03:50:19]  <Rig> "Just be ready, okay?"
[12-Jan-2014 03:52:11]  <Rig> ((Lemme know if I'm being too dominating in the RP))
[12-Jan-2014 03:52:58]  <ponicalica> ((I think you're fine.  I'm trying to strike a balance myself :V)
[12-Jan-2014 03:53:58]  * Hiiragi tenses up, tightening her hands. "Yes, you have my word, Jun. And you too, Ayako."
[12-Jan-2014 03:54:25]  <ponicalica> )
[12-Jan-2014 03:54:36]  <IllFlower> This isn't Lisp. :p
[12-Jan-2014 03:54:49]  <ponicalica> still gotta balance my parens though
[12-Jan-2014 03:55:06]  <Hiiragi> "This isn't easy, you're right. But… I'm not leaving, especially not now."
[12-Jan-2014 03:56:37]  <IllFlower> This got sentimental in a hurry, haha.
[12-Jan-2014 03:56:43]  <Barcode> something somehassen something sa yay gah
[12-Jan-2014 03:57:03]  <IllFlower> Barcode: For what it's worth, I loved Flight. Denzel Washington, goddamn.
[12-Jan-2014 03:58:08]  <Barcode> IllFlower: It wasn't a bad movie, and the juxtaposition of what he did to 1,1everyone covering his ass was really nice, but I was really, really weirded out by how much everyone was smoking in it. It almost felt like someone had paid them to make a point about it 1,1being better than alcoholism.
[12-Jan-2014 03:58:37]  <Barcode> like. everyone. smokes. i'm surprised the christian copilot and his kid didn't light up simultaneously when washington showed up.
[12-Jan-2014 03:58:45]  <IllFlower> Barcode: One vice follows another, that's the message I got.
[12-Jan-2014 04:00:15]  <IllFlower> Okay, I'm getting a feeling the conversation's done, haha. So--
[12-Jan-2014 04:00:32]  * Hiiragi continues slowly. "Please, just… say what you wish. I'll hush now if needed. I'm here for my own goals… and now you two, too."
[12-Jan-2014 04:00:36]  <Hiiragi> (Yeah done.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:01:28]  *** SF_Sorrow <SF_Sorrow@eduroam-225-252.ucsc.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[12-Jan-2014 04:01:48]  <IllFlower> A mild commotion out in the hallway draws the girls' attention.
[12-Jan-2014 04:01:55]  <Hiiragi> (Own goals as in, like, yeah I had my own catalyst. Just realized that could be read selfishly.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:02:04]  <IllFlower> It doesn't sound dangerous, but something's definitely happening out there. **
[12-Jan-2014 04:02:41]  <ponicalica> (("Did Hitomi punch someone again?"))
[12-Jan-2014 04:03:04]  <Hiiragi> (More like "Who got punched this time.")
[12-Jan-2014 04:03:18]  <IllFlower> I suspect you'll have to find out for yourself.
[12-Jan-2014 04:03:57]  <ponicalica> "We should probably head out there, see what's happening at the very least."  Ayako steels herself for whatever's ahead.
[12-Jan-2014 04:05:11]  <IllFlower> Ayako peeks her head out of the door, Hikari not far behind.
[12-Jan-2014 04:05:52]  * Hiiragi rises, alert. "Mhm. Jun, we won't be gone long." Hikari moves on alongside Ayako.
[12-Jan-2014 04:05:54]  <IllFlower> A team of doctors is rushing a stretcher down the hallway. Seems like the clatter was the source of the noise.
[12-Jan-2014 04:06:36]  <IllFlower> A girl follows running behind them for a short distance, but eventually slows down and stops.
[12-Jan-2014 04:07:39]  <IllFlower> She turns around and looks back down the hallway. Her eyes go wide for a moment when she sees Hikari in the nearby doorway. "Hiiragi, is that you?" **
[12-Jan-2014 04:07:56]  <IllFlower> (Alicia, you may go on as much or as little recognition as you want!)
[12-Jan-2014 04:08:13]  <ponicalica> (It was.........DUMBLEDORE)
[12-Jan-2014 04:08:25]  <BGTB2005> 14pffffffffffffffffff
[12-Jan-2014 04:10:02]  <Hiiragi> "Yes! Haruhi, it's been awhile. Okay, a week due to school clubs, but…" Hikari shakes her head. "What's happened, why are you here?"
[12-Jan-2014 04:10:51]  <ponicalica> ((do handshakes happen in japanland?  lol westernization))
[12-Jan-2014 04:11:13]  <IllFlower> She said "head," ponicalica. :p
[12-Jan-2014 04:11:25]  <ponicalica> ((oh whoops, misread :V))
[12-Jan-2014 04:11:48]  <BGTB2005> 14good job
[12-Jan-2014 04:11:49]  <Hiiragi> (I can see Hikari being that formal with a friend anyway. :v)
[12-Jan-2014 04:12:00]  <IllFlower> The girl screws up her face a little bit. "You're never going to stop calling me that, are you?" **
[12-Jan-2014 04:13:08]  <ponicalica> Ayako sort of just hangs behind Hikari.  She has no idea what's going on here.
[12-Jan-2014 04:13:23]  <IllFlower> She could always ask "who's this?"
[12-Jan-2014 04:13:33]  <IllFlower> You know, friendly. Or awkward.
[12-Jan-2014 04:14:38]  <IllFlower> Or, actually.
[12-Jan-2014 04:14:38]  *** Barcode is now known as Barcodrawing
[12-Jan-2014 04:16:12]  <IllFlower> Noticing Ayako's shyness, the girl smiles at her. "I'm Chihiro Kasuga. I went to middle school with Hikari. 'Haruhi' is just a silly nickname. You can ignore it.
[12-Jan-2014 04:16:49]  <IllFlower> "In fact, please ignore it." Chihiro's expression turns a little desperate.
[12-Jan-2014 04:17:01]  <Barcodrawing> lol.
[12-Jan-2014 04:17:05]  <ponicalica> (("Haruhi like the show?  Or the other show?"))
[12-Jan-2014 04:17:42]  <IllFlower> "Anyway, Hikari, are you here for..." She hesitates. "Can I talk about *that*?" Chihiro indicates Ayako with a flick of the eyes. **

[12-Jan-2014 04:19:43]  * Hiiragi chuckles, then grows stern. "Go on, *please*."
[12-Jan-2014 04:20:10]  <Hiiragi> (HAH. Good one IF. HAH.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:20:17]  <IllFlower> ("*that*" is magic, in case that wasn't clear)
[12-Jan-2014 04:20:32]  <Hiiragi> (I assumed as much.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:21:03]  <IllFlower> That response isn't going to help Chihiro make up her mind one way or the other... `_`

[12-Jan-2014 04:21:16]  <Rig> Jun sits in her room, sighing at the TV.
[12-Jan-2014 04:21:51]  <IllFlower> Well, whatever.
[12-Jan-2014 04:22:17]  * Hiiragi sighs. "Kasuga, you're here, so spit it out."
[12-Jan-2014 04:22:35]  <IllFlower> Chihiro glances at Hikari, then at Ayako, then back at Hikari.
[12-Jan-2014 04:23:45]  <IllFlower> "That was... Aki on the stretcher.
[12-Jan-2014 04:23:57]  <IllFlower> "She got attacked by a witch out of nowhere overnight." **
[12-Jan-2014 04:26:33]  <IllFlower> We do need to hurry the pace. I don't want this conversation to take as long as the rest of the session, haha.
[12-Jan-2014 04:26:45]  <ponicalica> Sorry, not sure what to say here :\
[12-Jan-2014 04:27:24]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi should maybe say something?
[12-Jan-2014 04:27:26]  <IllFlower> It's okay to indicate that. At least I won't think you've dropped off the face of the planet. :p
[12-Jan-2014 04:28:02]  <Hiiragi> "Aki? How could she…" Hikari glances off briefly. "Okay. Thank you." Hikari grimaces, motioning forward slightly. "Let's go to her. Ayako can come with."
[12-Jan-2014 04:28:13]  <Hiiragi> (Sorry, typing. :v)
[12-Jan-2014 04:28:18]  <ponicalica> (issok)
[12-Jan-2014 04:28:22]  <Hiiragi> (Also finding words.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:28:28]  <IllFlower> You're just going to leave Jun behind? That's a bit cold. :p
[12-Jan-2014 04:29:09]  <Hiiragi> (Not gone for *long*, you. A glance, then back to the *other* person in pain.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:29:49]  <Hiiragi> (Really though, had trouble figuring out how to say, like "Go to her briefly, then meet as a group in Jun's room.")
[12-Jan-2014 04:30:17]  <IllFlower> "We can't. They're taking her into an operation... it's nothing major, I don't think, but either way there's not enough space for us to watch."
[12-Jan-2014 04:30:37]  <IllFlower> Chihiro frowns slightly.
[12-Jan-2014 04:31:17]  <ponicalica> "Do you at least know what happened?"
[12-Jan-2014 04:31:38]  <IllFlower> "I-- I'm not sure. That was the third time she's been attacked in a week... this isn't normal..."
[12-Jan-2014 04:32:07]  <IllFlower> Chihiro stutters for a bit, then changes the subject.
[12-Jan-2014 04:32:25]  <IllFlower> "Sorry, I never got a chance to learn your name.
[12-Jan-2014 04:32:56]  <IllFlower> "I'm guessing you're not Takanashi," Chihiro says, reading off the room's nameplate. "You don't look like you've been a patient anytime recently..." **
[12-Jan-2014 04:34:29]  <ponicalica> "Uh, well, I was in here a few days ago, but no, I'm not here anymore.  Name's Minakami.  Uh, Ayako."
[12-Jan-2014 04:35:42]  <IllFlower> "Are you a magical girl too? Sorry to be so blunt." **
[12-Jan-2014 04:36:55]  <ponicalica> ((one sec, gotta get the full name for Conservators))
[12-Jan-2014 04:37:03]  <IllFlower> "of the Magical Order"
[12-Jan-2014 04:37:16]  <Barcodrawing> "-tan"
[12-Jan-2014 04:37:20]  <IllFlower> Hey, if you want to translate that into Latin, too, be my guest. :p
[12-Jan-2014 04:38:11]  <ponicalica> Then, the question becomes "Should Ayako be that pretentious?" :P
[12-Jan-2014 04:38:30]  <BGTB2005> 14yyyyyyyyyyy
[12-Jan-2014 04:38:48]  * Hiiragi backs off, giving Ayako and and Chihiro space. Antsy, she tries to give off a hopeful look.
[12-Jan-2014 04:39:13]  <Hiiragi> (Letting Ayako talk but not, like, putting her even more in the spotlight.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:39:31]  <ponicalica> "Conservator Ordinis Magici, even."
[12-Jan-2014 04:39:35]  <IllFlower> "Latin translation for 'conservator': 'conservator'"
[12-Jan-2014 04:40:20]  <IllFlower> "A Conservator..." Chihiro pauses in some awe. "Like Hikari, then."
[12-Jan-2014 04:40:45]  <IllFlower> (Meanwhile, Jun continues dying of boredom.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:41:12]  <IllFlower> "Wait, then maybe you can help us..." **
[12-Jan-2014 04:42:49]  <IllFlower> (Three attacks in a week really isn't normal. Imagine red flags and sirens.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:44:45]  <IllFlower> Rig: If you do want to say something, incidentally, Jun is well within earshot. They're just standing in the doorway to her room, after all.
[12-Jan-2014 04:44:54]  <Hiiragi> "Right you are. Before you continue, I think it'd be best if we sat down, instead of standing around here for… er, nothing." She pipes up, while motioning to a bed in front of Jun.
[12-Jan-2014 04:45:04]  <IllFlower> Subtle.
[12-Jan-2014 04:45:10]  <Rig> Oh, I thought they went down the hall.
[12-Jan-2014 04:45:11]  <IllFlower> We're just so subtle.
[12-Jan-2014 04:45:40]  <Hiiragi> (a separate bed*?)
[12-Jan-2014 04:45:52]  <ponicalica> (There's still the loose circle of chairs.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:45:54]  <IllFlower> "Oh, yeah, that's right..." Chihiro glances down the hallway to make sure nobody else caught any snatches of their conversation.
[12-Jan-2014 04:45:57]  <Hiiragi> (Like, I imagined doing this so Jun can listen, but can speak if she wants to.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:46:07]  <IllFlower> Yeah, there were three chairs and a stool in here, it's not a problem. :p
[12-Jan-2014 04:46:14]  <Hiiragi> (Instead of saying "Oh yeah, and here's Jun. :v"
[12-Jan-2014 04:46:15]  <Hiiragi> )
[12-Jan-2014 04:46:27]  <Hiiragi> (¬.¬)
[12-Jan-2014 04:46:34]  <IllFlower> "Is it okay if I come in here? Takanashi won't mind?" **
[12-Jan-2014 04:47:31]  <Rig> "Honestly, you could speak up too."
[12-Jan-2014 04:47:31]  <IllFlower> (You really can't spend too long polishing your words. Three minutes between lines in a conversation is going to make doing this over IRC take even longer than it already does.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:47:56]  <Rig> "Or just come in here and close the door. The nurses just did a round, we've got time."
[12-Jan-2014 04:48:18]  <ponicalica> "Let's get in.  If you have any information, it's probably better you tell all of us now so we get it."
[12-Jan-2014 04:48:42]  <Rig> Jun's been cooped up for [x] weeks. She is a very active person with kendo and all that. She wants to get out, remember..
[12-Jan-2014 04:48:53]  <IllFlower> Chihiro jumps a little at hearing Jun's voice, not realizing that she'd been able to hear everything.
[12-Jan-2014 04:49:14]  <ponicalica> wait, how long has it been again?
[12-Jan-2014 04:49:37]  <Barcodrawing> it is 3050. the clans have invaded terra
[12-Jan-2014 04:49:38]  <IllFlower> I haven't really decided.
[12-Jan-2014 04:49:45]  <IllFlower> Whatever, it's been a while.
[12-Jan-2014 04:49:47]  * Hiiragi nods. "We're all here together, after all."
[12-Jan-2014 04:50:12]  <ponicalica> for a second I read that as "We're in this together" and started thinking about the NIN song and MB arc again
[12-Jan-2014 04:50:18]  <IllFlower> "Sorry to intrude, Takanashi," Chihiro says rather formally as the other girls edge her into the room. **
[12-Jan-2014 04:51:48]  * Hiiragi fixes the seats into a circle again, before sitting down and eyeing Chihiro.
[12-Jan-2014 04:52:10]  <IllFlower> ("What? What did I do? o_o;;")
[12-Jan-2014 04:52:26]  <IllFlower> ("WE HAVE TO PUNISH YOU")
[12-Jan-2014 04:52:34]  <Rig> "No, don't be sorry." Jun says. She pushes herself up in bed again.
[12-Jan-2014 04:53:07]  <IllFlower> "Hikari told me about what happened to you," Chihiro says. She stops herself from saying "I'm sorry" again. **
[12-Jan-2014 04:53:08]  <Hiiragi> (I'm also trying to strike a balance between words, actions, and such. :v)
[12-Jan-2014 04:53:40]  <IllFlower> Hiiragi: Don't think too hard about it, seriously. In the end it'll make little difference other than taking a lot of time. :p
[12-Jan-2014 04:53:48]  <Hiiragi> (Point.)
[12-Jan-2014 04:54:45]  <Rig> Jun smiles as best she can at Chihiro.
[12-Jan-2014 04:54:58]  <Hiiragi> "I, yeah, that I did. We're all Conservators after all…" She tenses. "It kind of came out, at one point. Sorry."
[12-Jan-2014 04:56:14]  <ponicalica> "Anyways, do you know what might have caused the witch attacks?  Three in a week isn't common unless something's pushing it."
[12-Jan-2014 04:56:39]  <IllFlower> HIGH SPEED CONVERSATIONAL TRACK SWITCHING
[12-Jan-2014 04:57:14]  <IllFlower> Chihiro shakes her head. "I don't. It's not right, is it?
[12-Jan-2014 04:57:25]  <ponicalica> Ayako flips between social deficiencies at the drop of a hat.
[12-Jan-2014 04:57:25]  <IllFlower> "It feels like... someone's targeting her, somehow.
[12-Jan-2014 04:57:35]  <IllFlower> "Is that possible?
[12-Jan-2014 04:57:43]  <IllFlower> "Like... to send witches after someone, or...?" **
[12-Jan-2014 04:58:25]  <ponicalica> ((now should I make a reference to Snezana's backstory now :P))
[12-Jan-2014 04:59:01]  <IllFlower> (Well, canonically, it's more of a manifestation of ill will, but, uh, details...)
[12-Jan-2014 05:00:28]  <Rig> "I remember that near... anyway, I remember when there was particular anger towards myself and my group we had to deal with more than one witch at a time." Jun says.
[12-Jan-2014 05:00:46]  <ponicalica> "Well, some people think it might have happened a few times in Bosnia during the strife there, but it's hard to tell.  If it's possible, it's the sort of thing the Order would stamp out knowledge of, for sure."
[12-Jan-2014 05:00:54]  <IllFlower> (Uh-oh, I get a sense we're hitting a nerve with Jun.)
[12-Jan-2014 05:01:06]  <ponicalica> (fuck it, I'm throwing it in.  :P)
[12-Jan-2014 05:01:07]  <Rig> ((Just wanting to jump in more))
[12-Jan-2014 05:01:22]  <IllFlower> (Of course. Just an observation.)
[12-Jan-2014 05:01:38]  <Rig> "It happens," Jun says.
[12-Jan-2014 05:01:48]  <Rig> "Particularly when something is going wrong."
[12-Jan-2014 05:01:59]  <IllFlower> Chihiro's expression darkens.
[12-Jan-2014 05:02:10]  <Rig> <Seems to happen more often around this group.> Jun thinks to herself.
[12-Jan-2014 05:02:19]  <IllFlower> "Then... if this keeps happening..."
[12-Jan-2014 05:02:25]  <IllFlower> She leaves the obvious conclusion unstated. **
[12-Jan-2014 05:02:40]  <Hiiragi> "Then we need to get to the bottom of this. Somehow."
[12-Jan-2014 05:03:07]  <ponicalica> ("If it keeps happening, we could see a double event within the week.")
[12-Jan-2014 05:03:19]  <Rig> ((And after that a triple event))
[12-Jan-2014 05:03:39]  <IllFlower> ("What happens when we run out of -uple words?!")
[12-Jan-2014 05:03:51]  <Barcodrawing> there won't BE a purpupleth time!
[12-Jan-2014 05:04:01]  <ponicalica> ((I couldn't remember if dude from Torchwood mentioned the triple event))
[12-Jan-2014 05:04:11]  <IllFlower> Suddenly, a Barcodrawing jumps out of the hospital's floor tiles.
[12-Jan-2014 05:04:30]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[12-Jan-2014 05:04:42]  <Hiiragi> (Lol.)
[12-Jan-2014 05:05:36]  <IllFlower> "Aki's already in the hospital. If she gets attacked again in her current state, and there's nobody there to watch over her, she might actually... die...
[12-Jan-2014 05:06:03]  <IllFlower> "Is there something you can do? Make sure that doesn't happen? Please?" **
[12-Jan-2014 05:06:07]  <Rig> "I'm..." Jun pauses. "I'm here. I could keep an eye on her."
[12-Jan-2014 05:06:21]  <Rig> "I need something to do. I'm getting restless."
[12-Jan-2014 05:06:28]  <ponicalica> "Are you sure you're up for it?"
[12-Jan-2014 05:07:31]  <Rig> Jun shrugs. "No, but do you expect me to ignore a person in need?"
[12-Jan-2014 05:07:51]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.90.1 [Firefox 26.0/20131205075310])
[12-Jan-2014 05:08:03]  <IllFlower> Chihiro interjects as well. "I didn't mean to-- Minakami's right, you don't look all that well--" **
[12-Jan-2014 05:10:01]  <Rig> Jun gives Chihiro a sour look.
[12-Jan-2014 05:10:11]  <Rig> "I don't look that well?"
[12-Jan-2014 05:10:32]  <Rig> ((Z snaps are appropriate))
[12-Jan-2014 05:10:59]  <IllFlower> Someone call Sunrise, I have a great idea for a magical girl show...
[12-Jan-2014 05:11:23]  <ponicalica> hm?
[12-Jan-2014 05:11:49]  <IllFlower> Z-snapping magical girls.
[12-Jan-2014 05:11:52]  <IllFlower> It's gotta happen.
[12-Jan-2014 05:12:17]  <Hiiragi> "At the very least, Chihiro, I'm staying to help. You don't even need to ask," Hikari pipes up, trying to ease the tension. "Trust Jun and Ayako like you trust me. We can handle this, Chihiro."
[12-Jan-2014 05:12:20]  <IllFlower> Not wanting to offend Jun any further, Chihiro simply falls silent. **
[12-Jan-2014 05:12:21]  <BGTB2005> 14unless the user's AFK, I could ping a Sunrise in another channel...
[12-Jan-2014 05:12:56]  <ponicalica> 14heh, he means the animu studio
[12-Jan-2014 05:13:18]  <ponicalica> "At any rate, we can try to find things out, but it might be hard without leads."
[12-Jan-2014 05:13:39]  <ponicalica> (and suddenly, in appears Hibiki and her Holmesian deductions)
[12-Jan-2014 05:13:58]  <Hiiragi> (It was YOU ALL ALONG.)
[12-Jan-2014 05:14:52]  <IllFlower> "What do you mean?" Chihiro asks, more timidly. "What kinds of leads?" **
[12-Jan-2014 05:15:18]  <ponicalica> "Well, people you might have pissed off, other weird things happened to you, that sort of thing."
[12-Jan-2014 05:16:21]  <IllFlower> She's not the victim, remember. :p
[12-Jan-2014 05:16:36]  <Barcodrawing> people hurtperson might have pissed off*
[12-Jan-2014 05:16:47]  <ponicalica> yeah what barcode said :P
[12-Jan-2014 05:17:29]  <IllFlower> "She always seemed to be on really good terms with everyone, Aki.
[12-Jan-2014 05:17:45]  <IllFlower> "I can't imagine why anyone would have it out for her, especially like this.
[12-Jan-2014 05:19:07]  <IllFlower> "Well, that doesn't much help, because apparently someone does...
[12-Jan-2014 05:19:18]  <IllFlower> "Then I think it's someone I don't know, at least.
[12-Jan-2014 05:19:43]  <IllFlower> "You might have to ask her, but she's... not really available." **
[12-Jan-2014 05:21:20]  <Hiiragi> "Aside from you and me, who else in the Order has spoken with her since the attack? If need be, we can question them… retrace her steps, somehow."
[12-Jan-2014 05:21:30]  <Hiiragi> has she*
[12-Jan-2014 05:21:35]  <Hiiragi> (Wait no.)
[12-Jan-2014 05:22:27]  <IllFlower> "In the Order" just means "is an initiate," if that's what you're going for.
[12-Jan-2014 05:22:52]  <Hiiragi> Yeah.
[12-Jan-2014 05:23:46]  <IllFlower> That's a lot of people!
[12-Jan-2014 05:24:09]  <ponicalica> I think she's trying to trace her magical social circles
[12-Jan-2014 05:24:13]  <Hiiragi> (Within our circle!)
[12-Jan-2014 05:24:32]  <IllFlower> SPOILER: It was Hitomi all along!
[12-Jan-2014 05:25:51]  <IllFlower> I think we may be dead-ended here. Chihiro doesn't know much.
[12-Jan-2014 05:26:01]  <Barcodrawing> hold on
[12-Jan-2014 05:26:12]  <Barcodrawing> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8731765/Pictures%20and%20video/emoticons/idntgtt.png this is chihiro. you may continue
[12-Jan-2014 05:26:12]  <Rig> You're out of this game, dork.

[12-Jan-2014 05:26:29]  <IllFlower> I'm inclined to say that the characters might have to wait until another witch attack to glean clues from the witch itself...
[12-Jan-2014 05:26:35]  <Barcodrawing> Rig: whatever, man. i'm listening to nu metal, nobody can tell me waht to do.
[12-Jan-2014 05:26:51]  <IllFlower> Wow, you're right.
[12-Jan-2014 05:27:05]  <IllFlower> Nu metal really is the genre for people impervious to authority. :p
[12-Jan-2014 05:27:12]  <Barcodrawing> lol.
[12-Jan-2014 05:28:03]  <ponicalica> Is IllFlower saying he wants to skip to the next witch attack?
[12-Jan-2014 05:28:21]  <IllFlower> Well, not now, obviously.
[12-Jan-2014 05:28:32]  <IllFlower> But that's my suggestion, at least.
[12-Jan-2014 05:29:14]  <Hiiragi> "Then if none of us know anyone, we may have to just… wait. Well, I don't think that changes much of my plans, anyway, I'm already here around the clock. What about you, Ayako? Chihiro?"
[12-Jan-2014 05:29:50]  <IllFlower> "Me?" Chihiro asks, puzzled.
[12-Jan-2014 05:31:48]  <Hiiragi> "Yes, to stay here. The more of us there are together, the better it will be for everyone."
[12-Jan-2014 05:32:23]  <ponicalica> "I'm okay with staying."
[12-Jan-2014 05:32:54]  <IllFlower> Hm, let me check the NPC assist mechanics right quick...
[12-Jan-2014 05:34:04]  <IllFlower> 2d6 stat boost plus a 1d6 trait, okay. That's not hideously unfair.
[12-Jan-2014 05:34:54]  <IllFlower> "I'll stay too," Chihiro says, with an air of determination.
[12-Jan-2014 05:35:44]  <IllFlower> "My parents might yell at me, but if it means keeping Aki out of danger, then so be it." **
[12-Jan-2014 05:37:15]  * Hiiragi smiles, growing more confident. "Excellent, I'm glad you're with us." She looks towards Jun inquiringly "And you're certain on keeping watch, too?"
[12-Jan-2014 05:38:24]  <ponicalica> "I don't think Jun could back down from protecting people.  I wish I could be that strong."
[12-Jan-2014 05:38:47]  <Rig> Jun blushes, but smiles "I can keep an eye out.
[12-Jan-2014 05:38:48]  <Rig> "
[12-Jan-2014 05:39:18]  <ponicalica> (yuri fans go nuts at this point)
[12-Jan-2014 05:40:39]  <IllFlower> Damn, I gave my goggles back to Haven.
[12-Jan-2014 05:40:51]  <IllFlower> All right, I think we can wrap up here, then?
[12-Jan-2014 05:40:56]  <Hiiragi> Yes.
[12-Jan-2014 05:41:00]  <ponicalica> yeah
[12-Jan-2014 05:41:01]  <Hiiragi> I think so.
[12-Jan-2014 05:41:23]  <ponicalica> next time: plot twist: the witch turns out to be Hibiki
[12-Jan-2014 05:41:23]  <IllFlower> The beginning of the next session will be pretty damn obvious, I suspect.
[12-Jan-2014 05:41:36]  <Rig> IllFlower: Cool. Sorry I wasn't much in this session.
[12-Jan-2014 05:41:43]  <Rig> Sorry that we had no conflicts.
[12-Jan-2014 05:42:34]  <Hiiragi> Yeah, I'm more used to this than the first one, kind of getting a handle on it. Trying not to overdo anything, but I did realize the time gaps. ¬.¬;
[12-Jan-2014 05:42:42]  *** Hiiragi is now known as Alicia
[12-Jan-2014 05:42:46]  <ponicalica> yeah, sorry about the time gaps :V
[12-Jan-2014 05:42:52]  <IllFlower> This went better than I was expecting, to be honest.
[12-Jan-2014 05:43:07]  <IllFlower> Given that I didn't plan all that much and Saladofstones wasn't around.
[12-Jan-2014 05:43:20]  <Rig> It was fun. I really liked it.
[12-Jan-2014 05:43:32]  <Rig> I really wish Barcode was still in, but I understnad.
[12-Jan-2014 05:43:57]  <Alicia> Part of it, for me, is trying to… I dunno, say enough as a character for others to go off of, but not hog any time? That sort of stuff.
[12-Jan-2014 05:43:59]  <IllFlower> I'm glad you guys had fun. Thanks for playing.
[12-Jan-2014 05:44:00]  <Alicia> And same.
[12-Jan-2014 05:44:14]  <Alicia> go off of while contributing*
[12-Jan-2014 05:44:30]  <IllFlower> Next session may be a little dicey since I've got plans for the holiday weekend.
[12-Jan-2014 05:44:35]  <Rig> Alicia: It gets easier as you go on.
[12-Jan-2014 05:44:44]  <IllFlower> We might hold it during the week if we can find a time.
[12-Jan-2014 05:44:45]  <Alicia> School starts up for me very soon, IllFlower, so…
[12-Jan-2014 05:44:53]  <Alicia> Gotcha, Rig.
[12-Jan-2014 05:45:04]  <Rig> IllFlower: I'm free on weekends and Tues/Thurs.
[12-Jan-2014 05:45:08]  <Alicia> I like playing Hikari, though.
[12-Jan-2014 05:45:20]  <IllFlower> Okay, cool.
[12-Jan-2014 05:45:36]  <IllFlower> I'll post another thing soon.
[12-Jan-2014 05:45:42]  <IllFlower> Vote poll thing.
