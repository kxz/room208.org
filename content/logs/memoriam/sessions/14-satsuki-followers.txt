[08-Mar-2014 00:38:15]  <IllFlower> They're in various states. Some of them look ready to move into; the walls of others are yet to be painted; yet others still have exposed joists.

[08-Mar-2014 00:42:46]  <ponicalica> Ayako slowly steps toward the door and makes a motion for the knob.
[08-Mar-2014 00:43:42]  <Hiiragi> Hikari turns the knob, gently sliding the door open. "How about you?"
[08-Mar-2014 00:44:47]  <IllFlower> Ayako edges her way into the room to see a sparsely-furnished studio. A kitchenette sits to the side of the entrance hallway, with a few dishes sitting in the sink.
[08-Mar-2014 00:46:03]  <IllFlower> At the center of the hardwood floor in the main room lie a low table with cushions around it, a thin mattress with blankets scattered over it, and a few scattered books.
[08-Mar-2014 00:46:25]  <IllFlower> There's a small field of scattered papers on the table.
[08-Mar-2014 00:46:40]  <IllFlower> "Have a seat," Mai says. "Do you want tea or something?"
[08-Mar-2014 00:47:25]  <ponicalica> "I, uh, if you're offering, I guess."
[08-Mar-2014 00:48:07]  <Hiiragi> "I appreciate the offer, but no thanks, Shirakawa."
[08-Mar-2014 00:48:56]  <IllFlower> Mai nods, disappears briefly, and returns with two small mugs of tea.
[08-Mar-2014 00:49:08]  <IllFlower> She sets one in front of Ayako, and one in front of herself as she takes a seat.
[08-Mar-2014 00:49:37]  <IllFlower> "Never thought I would have guests here," Mai muses. "At least not so soon."
[08-Mar-2014 00:49:49]  <IllFlower> She takes a sip of her tea. "So where should I start?"
[08-Mar-2014 00:51:07]  <ponicalica> Ayako takes a sip.  "The name you mentioned earlier.  Osada?"
[08-Mar-2014 00:51:59]  <IllFlower> Mai closes her eyes. She brings her cup to her nose and inhales deeply, then exhales as she sets it down.
[08-Mar-2014 00:52:32]  <IllFlower> "Satsuki Osada's been building a little army," she finally says, opening her eyes again.
[08-Mar-2014 00:53:21]  <IllFlower> "She has a vendetta against a friend of hers. Or former friend, I should say."
[08-Mar-2014 00:53:56]  <ponicalica> "...And she's willing to commit mass murder for it?"
[08-Mar-2014 00:54:39]  <IllFlower> "Of course," Mai says, with a sarcastic laugh as if Ayako's conclusion were obvious.
[08-Mar-2014 00:55:12]  <Hiiragi> "Just what did this former friend of hers do? And who is she?"
[08-Mar-2014 00:55:14]  <IllFlower> "That's how she's been recruiting people, actually. The promise of blood."
[08-Mar-2014 00:55:46]  <IllFlower> Hiiragi: "The friend's name is Emi Fukuda.
[08-Mar-2014 00:56:20]  <IllFlower> "Emi's got a contingent of her own. Or maybe it'd be more accurate to call it a posse?"
[08-Mar-2014 00:56:50]  <IllFlower> Mai pauses for a moment, thinking.
[08-Mar-2014 00:57:46]  <IllFlower> "Anyway, from what I know, Emi's a girl of some means. The Order takes all kinds, right? So every once in a while you get someone from a rich family like hers.
[08-Mar-2014 00:58:18]  <IllFlower> "And, well, money can buy you a lot of things, even in the magical world.
[08-Mar-2014 00:59:59]  <IllFlower> "So let's say that a few months ago a bunch of Emi's acquaintances suddenly started to look like they'd won the lottery. Flashy clothes, new gadgets, expensive vacations. What would you think was going on?"

[08-Mar-2014 01:04:14]  <ponicalica> ("Two more and we'd get a reward, right?")
[08-Mar-2014 01:04:31]  <IllFlower> Before that, even.
[08-Mar-2014 01:04:46]  <ponicalica> oh, her
[08-Mar-2014 01:06:28]  <Hiiragi> Er, not coming to mind.
[08-Mar-2014 01:06:49]  <ponicalica> "The sort of job the Order tends to frown on, probably..."
[08-Mar-2014 01:07:02]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi: remember what Akiko's boyfriend said about her
[08-Mar-2014 01:07:15]  <Hiiragi> Ooh. Oh geez.
[08-Mar-2014 01:09:16]  <IllFlower> "That's about right. Suffice it to say that Emi was willing to share the wealth, and she had no shortage of friends and people pretending to be her friends that lined up for it."
[08-Mar-2014 01:10:22]  <ponicalica> Ayako whispers to Hikari, "Is this the «magical civil war» Shii was mentioning to us?"
[08-Mar-2014 01:10:48]  <IllFlower> Mai takes another sip from the cup she's cradling in her hands. "By all accounts, it looks like Satsuki was one of the latter. She didn't care much for Emi, but the money was good enough.
[08-Mar-2014 01:11:07]  <IllFlower> "But you know how these things go. There's only so long you can fake it before you get found out."
[08-Mar-2014 01:13:08]  <Hiiragi> "That sounds about right, Ayako, I didn't think it'd be like this thought..." Hikari whispers back.
[08-Mar-2014 01:14:29]  <Hiiragi> "Did Emi find out about this before Satsuki could do anything?"
[08-Mar-2014 01:15:04]  <IllFlower> Not sure what that means, Hiiragi.
[08-Mar-2014 01:17:41]  <Hiiragi> Sorry, bad phrasing. Only so long until you can fake it, so did Emi realize Satsuki was lying and confront her, or what.
[08-Mar-2014 01:18:44]  <IllFlower> "Oh, yes, she found out," Mai says, in a tone suggesting wild understatement.
[08-Mar-2014 01:20:10]  <IllFlower> "Emi might have money, but she's delicate in other ways. She decided that she needed to make an example out of Satsuki, so that nobody else would do the same thing to her.
[08-Mar-2014 01:20:29]  <IllFlower> "So she basically publicly excommunicated Satsuki from her circle of friends.
[08-Mar-2014 01:20:52]  <IllFlower> "I would say that was an overreaction, but it pales in comparison to what happened afterwards..."
[08-Mar-2014 01:24:45]  <Hiiragi> "Did she go after other liars, or... kill someone? If she's not that delicate, that is."
[08-Mar-2014 01:25:52]  <IllFlower> "Oh, no. Emi was content with just kicking Satsuki to the curb.
[08-Mar-2014 01:26:12]  <IllFlower> "Satsuki, on the other hand... Satsuki Osada...
[08-Mar-2014 01:27:15]  <ponicalica> "Minami Tsuchida was one of hers, yes?"
[08-Mar-2014 01:27:32]  <IllFlower> "Along with the people who loved Emi, or were at least willing to take advantage of her, there were people who despised her, saw her machinations as nothing more than crude power grabs.

[08-Mar-2014 01:44:16]  <ponicalica> "One last question.  Where did you learn this?"
[08-Mar-2014 01:44:44]  <IllFlower> "I'm allowed to hide," Mai says. "You might say I have no choice but to, given what you" - she looks at Ayako - "did to smoke us out.
[08-Mar-2014 01:45:00]  <IllFlower> "But you can't. You're Conservators. If you run, what's left?"
[08-Mar-2014 01:45:44]  <IllFlower> She laughs. "I can't believe I'm trying to encourage you. I guess that tells you everything you need to know about how far out of hand this situation has gotten."

[08-Mar-2014 01:54:05]  <IllFlower> Mai looks incredulously at Hikari.
[08-Mar-2014 01:54:30]  <IllFlower> She says nothing, but the question "Have you been living under a rock for the last two months?" is implicit.

[08-Mar-2014 02:16:11]  <IllFlower> Ayako rushes to the back of the apartment, pulling aside the curtain covering the sliding door.
[08-Mar-2014 02:16:49]  <IllFlower> She sees, just overhead, a large hole in one corner of the barrier cube, accompanied by a considerable amount of smoke.
[08-Mar-2014 02:18:29]  <ponicalica> just overhead as in one of the upper vertices of the cube?
[08-Mar-2014 02:18:51]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[08-Mar-2014 02:19:03]  <IllFlower> I mean, it's still a hundred meters up and all.

[08-Mar-2014 02:21:39]  <IllFlower> Just as Hikari finishes her question, a large fireball of some sort comes screaming in through the hole in the barrier, slamming into the ground about ten meters away and scattering chunks of dirt and concrete everywhere.
[08-Mar-2014 02:22:24]  <ponicalica> oshit
[08-Mar-2014 02:22:39]  <IllFlower> Ayako leaps away from the balcony door in fear that it'll smash to pieces, but it holds, at least for the moment.

[08-Mar-2014 02:26:23]  <IllFlower> I'd recommend not waiting around inside the building. Those fireballs look pretty dangerous.

[08-Mar-2014 02:29:53]  <ponicalica> Ayako finds the fire escape and starts running down.

[08-Mar-2014 02:32:49]  <IllFlower> She spots three figures standing on the opposite side of the street. One of them seems to be charging up for an attack. He's more than likely the one tossing fireballs into the ring.
[08-Mar-2014 02:33:23]  <IllFlower> The other two seem to be looking out for anyone inside the cube. They haven't spotted Ayako, fortunately.
[08-Mar-2014 02:34:23]  <ponicalica> What time is it by now?
[08-Mar-2014 02:34:59]  <IllFlower> Late afternoon.
[08-Mar-2014 02:37:00]  <ponicalica> Ayako flashes some light at the other two assailants from a building in a different part of the cube, to distract them from the three girls and figure out a proper plan.
[08-Mar-2014 02:37:27]  <IllFlower> They're actually ants. Ayako accidentally vaporizes them.

[08-Mar-2014 02:38:28]  <IllFlower> No, just kidding. The light draws their attention, and soon enough the boy is lobbing fireballs at it in the vain hopes of drawing someone out.
[08-Mar-2014 02:38:43]  <IllFlower> Better come up with a plan fast, though.
[08-Mar-2014 02:40:25]  <Hiiragi> What, besides running as far away in the opposite direction as possible.
[08-Mar-2014 02:41:40]  <IllFlower> They may not see Ayako in the corner of a building right now, but three girls running is probably pushing everyone's luck.
[08-Mar-2014 02:42:19]  <Hiiragi> Point.
[08-Mar-2014 02:42:50]  <Hiiragi> Can Ayako magic something right into somebody's face? Painfully.
[08-Mar-2014 02:43:02]  <IllFlower> ponicalica?
[08-Mar-2014 02:43:49]  <ponicalica> Maybe.  Ayako can be pretty timid though, and seeing her colleague die isn't going to make her *more* likely to run into a direct confrontation unless she has to.
[08-Mar-2014 02:44:53]  <Hiiragi> Because I don't think Hiiragi's a magic person. Certainly not from far away? Plus direct confrontation sounds like a bad idea, even if it's 3 on 3.
[08-Mar-2014 02:45:18]  <IllFlower> I'd recommend coming up with something, before they weaken the barrier enough to bring it down.
[08-Mar-2014 02:47:22]  <ponicalica> I don't suppose flashing the Conservator sigil would make them stop...
[08-Mar-2014 02:47:48]  <IllFlower> You never know.
[08-Mar-2014 02:48:03]  <Buttercupistiny> he might not but you do
[08-Mar-2014 02:48:57]  <IllFlower> Well, yeah, that's my job. :D
[08-Mar-2014 02:50:23]  <ponicalica> "I think I have a plan.  These guys are probably coming after Mai, since she's the one who set up the barrier, yes?"
[08-Mar-2014 02:50:56]  <ponicalica> Ayako tries to control her voice to be loud enough to be heard over the fireballs here, but not loud enough to be noticed over there.
[08-Mar-2014 02:52:28]  <Hiiragi> "And what do you have in mind?"
[08-Mar-2014 02:52:46]  <IllFlower> "I can't imagine who else they'd be after," Mai responds. She's already transformed into her costume, a rather restrained crimson number.
[08-Mar-2014 02:55:01]  <ponicalica> Ayako transforms.  "We're taking her in for her role in the theft from the Library of the Ancients.  Given what you've told me, you have a much better chance with the Order than with them."
[08-Mar-2014 02:55:55]  <Hiiragi> (So it's time to fight back, eh.)
[08-Mar-2014 02:56:04]  <IllFlower> Mai laughs. "Of course."
[08-Mar-2014 02:57:35]  <ponicalica> (Now I'm thinking of the idea of using a costume in a social conflict, lol)

[08-Mar-2014 03:02:45]  <ponicalica> Ayako and Hikari set themselves into position with Mai, and walk toward the gap in the cube helpfully provided by the assailants.
[08-Mar-2014 03:04:21]  <IllFlower> The three other initiates, taken aback by the presence of three times as many girls as they expected, simply stare at Ayako and Hikari as they lead Mai out of the barrier.
[08-Mar-2014 03:04:39]  <IllFlower> "What's going on?" the boy calls. He eyes the crest on Ayako's costume.
[08-Mar-2014 03:05:56]  <ponicalica> "An arrest.  She was part of the cult of Kotomi Taniguchi."  (I forget, do we have an official name for false priesthoods and the like?)
[08-Mar-2014 03:08:25]  <IllFlower> Nah, we'll just roll with that.
[08-Mar-2014 03:09:01]  <IllFlower> "I never heard anything about a cult," the boy says, skeptically.
[08-Mar-2014 03:09:45]  <IllFlower> "She is on the list, though. *Our* list."
[08-Mar-2014 03:11:25]  <ponicalica> How long has it even been since the Kotomi episodes
[08-Mar-2014 03:11:32]  <ponicalica> in-universe time, that is
[08-Mar-2014 03:12:56]  <IllFlower> Not long. Jun died maybe a week after she got out of the hospital.
[08-Mar-2014 03:13:23]  <Hiiragi> "What issue do *you* have with our culprit?"
[08-Mar-2014 03:15:57]  <IllFlower> "Enough that I'm considering fighting you for her. Does that answer your question?"
[08-Mar-2014 03:16:23]  <Hiiragi> (Hoho.)
[08-Mar-2014 03:19:10]  <Hiiragi> ponicalica, what are your thoughts?
[08-Mar-2014 03:19:18]  <ponicalica> i'm thinking up a response :V
[08-Mar-2014 03:19:33]  <Hiiragi> I'm lukewarm towards fighting, but Mystery Dude seems uncooperative. Which is an issue.
[08-Mar-2014 03:19:38]  <IllFlower> ("No, it doesn't. Now tell me.")
[08-Mar-2014 03:19:58]  <ponicalica> "Not really.  What's so important that it necessitates interfering with the operations of Conservators?"
[08-Mar-2014 03:21:21]  <IllFlower> "It's between us and her. You Conservators have nothing to do with it."
[08-Mar-2014 03:22:37]  <Hiiragi> I don't reaallly want to fight 3v3 but MD needs to listen to us Conservators.
[08-Mar-2014 03:22:41]  <Hiiragi> fight much*
[08-Mar-2014 03:22:41]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi: how would you feel about a social conflict, with Mai as the stakes?
[08-Mar-2014 03:22:50]  <Hiiragi> 3v3,*
[08-Mar-2014 03:22:56]  <Hiiragi> I'd be up for it, ponicalica.
[08-Mar-2014 03:24:22]  * Hiiragi looks through the ditv PDF.
[08-Mar-2014 03:24:53]  <IllFlower> Do you really want Mai as the stakes? Sounds like a big thing to give away straight off the bat.
[08-Mar-2014 03:25:03]  <IllFlower> Maybe just finding out what the kid is up to might be more prudent.
[08-Mar-2014 03:25:11]  <Hiiragi> ... yeah.
[08-Mar-2014 03:25:18]  <ponicalica> true
[08-Mar-2014 03:25:22]  <Hiiragi> Just make him stop being a nuisance.
[08-Mar-2014 03:25:33]  <IllFlower> ("I'll fight you to see who's truly worthy of her love!")
[08-Mar-2014 03:26:05]  <Hiiragi> (lol)
[08-Mar-2014 03:28:11]  <ponicalica> So you're suggesting a conflict for finding out what these three are up to?
[08-Mar-2014 03:28:18]  <ponicalica> I'm down for that, I think
[08-Mar-2014 03:28:37]  <IllFlower> Yeah. You'd raise first, after I come up with an NPC for this group.
[08-Mar-2014 03:28:39]  <ponicalica> (random linguistic thought: "up for X" and "down for X" have the same meaning.  Has Language Log investigated this?)
[08-Mar-2014 03:30:08]  <IllFlower> Probably.
[08-Mar-2014 03:32:27]  <IllFlower> Okay, I've got some numbers up. Venue's talking.

[08-Mar-2014 04:05:59]  <BGTB2005> it might encourage them to withdraw
[08-Mar-2014 04:06:00]  <IllFlower> Is Hikari actually hitting anyone yet?
[08-Mar-2014 04:06:19]  <ponicalica> I think Hikari's just pulling out her staff and waving it around a bit
[08-Mar-2014 04:06:20]  <IllFlower> If not, then you're well okay.
[08-Mar-2014 04:06:25]  <Hiiragi> IllFlower: Nope.
[08-Mar-2014 04:06:35]  <Hiiragi> Er, to hitting.
[08-Mar-2014 04:06:47]  *** Xeniera <~Solstace@71-222-76-51.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness

[08-Mar-2014 04:06:57]  <Hiiragi> And yeah. Got it.
[08-Mar-2014 04:08:37]  <IllFlower> Do still need dice.
[08-Mar-2014 04:08:59]  <Hiiragi> Hikari produces her staff, eyeing down the guy in front of her. "It would be best for all of us if you all were cooperative, or disappeared."
[08-Mar-2014 04:09:03]  <Hiiragi> @dice use 3 4

[08-Mar-2014 04:11:21]  <Hiiragi> ?
[08-Mar-2014 04:11:34]  <IllFlower> "Tch," the boy spits. "I guess we don't have a choice."
[08-Mar-2014 04:11:49]  <Hiiragi> (Oh, no.)
[08-Mar-2014 04:11:55]  <IllFlower> He balls his hand into a fist and takes a swing at Hikari's stomach.
[08-Mar-2014 04:12:07]  <IllFlower> Escalating to hand-to-hand combat. Roll Bd+Wl.

[08-Mar-2014 04:13:42]  <IllFlower> Going to see 3 4 and raise 6 6 against Hikari.
[08-Mar-2014 04:13:51]  <IllFlower> Both with the punch.
[08-Mar-2014 04:13:53]  <IllFlower> @dice use 3 4 6 6

[08-Mar-2014 04:14:12]  <IllFlower> Goddamn, all these 1s.
[08-Mar-2014 04:14:55]  <Hiiragi> I already rolled for my staff, yes?
[08-Mar-2014 04:15:09]  <ponicalica> yeah
[08-Mar-2014 04:15:20]  <Hiiragi> Checkin'.
[08-Mar-2014 04:15:35]  <ponicalica> Is it even permissible to use your staff as a non-magical weapon?
[08-Mar-2014 04:16:08]  <Hiiragi> I'm not sure how you would. It's magical.
[08-Mar-2014 04:16:27]  <BGTB2005> I'd imagine getting smacked by it would hurt a bit
[08-Mar-2014 04:16:34]  <ponicalica> that would be another escalation.  I guess you could use it defensively or something?
[08-Mar-2014 04:17:14]  <Hiiragi> Yeah.
[08-Mar-2014 04:17:51]  <Hiiragi> Make sense to bring in my 1d10 as a Conservator here? We've been strutting around as such for awhile, and now we're in fistcuffs.
[08-Mar-2014 04:17:54]  <IllFlower> I mean, it'd be akin to pistol-whipping someone.
[08-Mar-2014 04:18:04]  <IllFlower> That's not shooting so it wouldn't be an escalation.
[08-Mar-2014 04:18:05]  <Hiiragi> fisticuffs*
[08-Mar-2014 04:18:15]  <IllFlower> Escalation would be rather pointless anyway, as we've used all of our stat dice.
[08-Mar-2014 04:18:52]  <Hiiragi> @dice add 1d10

[08-Mar-2014 04:18:59]  <IllFlower> And no, I'm going to give you the same response I gave ponicalica when he wanted to add his relationship.
[08-Mar-2014 04:19:08]  <Hiiragi> Oh right.
[08-Mar-2014 04:19:12]  <Hiiragi> @dice use 10

[08-Mar-2014 04:19:30]  <ponicalica> man omni's totally trolling us with the dice that IllFlower is rescinding though
[08-Mar-2014 04:19:35]  <Hiiragi> Not on the line, so...
[08-Mar-2014 04:21:12]  <Hiiragi> Hikari barely manages to shield herself from the punch, bringing her staff down just in time. "Great..." she mutters, remembering how the last fight went.
[08-Mar-2014 04:21:15]  <Hiiragi> @dice use 5 6
[08-Mar-2014 04:21:15]  <Omnipresence> 14Hiiragi: Used 5 6 = 11. Bank now has 1 1 1 2 2 4 4 5 5 5 = 30.
[08-Mar-2014 04:21:22]  <IllFlower> You're short 1.
[08-Mar-2014 04:21:29]  <IllFlower> You need to see 12.
[08-Mar-2014 04:21:39]  <Hiiragi> Yeah. 5 and 6 are my highest, I thought.
[08-Mar-2014 04:21:46]  <ponicalica> you'd have to add a third die
[08-Mar-2014 04:21:53]  <ponicalica> and Take the Blow for 3d8
[08-Mar-2014 04:22:55]  <Hiiragi> So add 1 and then not be able to add another later?
[08-Mar-2014 04:23:06]  <Hiiragi> Er, in the turn after.
[08-Mar-2014 04:23:11]  <ponicalica> nope
[08-Mar-2014 04:23:14]  <ponicalica> that's assists
[08-Mar-2014 04:23:21]  <ponicalica> you'd be Seeing 651
[08-Mar-2014 04:23:30]  <ponicalica> and you'd have to take 3d8 fallout after the conflict
[08-Mar-2014 04:23:36]  <Hiiragi> Ah, after.
[08-Mar-2014 04:23:48]  <IllFlower> Or, equivalently, 255, which at least lets you hold on to your 6.
[08-Mar-2014 04:24:52]  <Hiiragi> Okay, adding 5 6 and then doing 255, actually.
[08-Mar-2014 04:24:57]  <Hiiragi> 5 6 back*
[08-Mar-2014 04:25:16]  <Hiiragi> @dice add 5 6

[08-Mar-2014 04:25:31]  <ponicalica> wait, didn't you want to use 255?
[08-Mar-2014 04:25:35]  <Hiiragi> No.
[08-Mar-2014 04:25:36]  <Hiiragi> Gah.
[08-Mar-2014 04:25:43]  <ponicalica> readd the 156 I guess :V
[08-Mar-2014 04:25:46]  <Hiiragi> Sorry, I was looking at the wrong thing. >_<
[08-Mar-2014 04:25:47]  <Hiiragi> Yeah.
[08-Mar-2014 04:25:54]  <Hiiragi> @dice add 1 5 6

[08-Mar-2014 04:26:11]  <Hiiragi> I glanced up but at the wrong thing, sorry.
[08-Mar-2014 04:26:35]  <IllFlower> So that means Hikari takes the punch and 3d8 fallout.
[08-Mar-2014 04:27:12]  <Hiiragi> Yes.
[08-Mar-2014 04:27:29]  <IllFlower> Who's going to raise next?
[08-Mar-2014 04:27:37]  <ponicalica> @dice

[08-Mar-2014 04:27:53]  <IllFlower> So many 1s.
[08-Mar-2014 04:28:49]  <ponicalica> I'm fine with raising first if IllFlower doesn't want to
[08-Mar-2014 04:28:53]  *** WildSeraph <~Spheraph@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[08-Mar-2014 04:29:11]  <IllFlower> I just raised.
[08-Mar-2014 04:29:20]  <ponicalica> oh right
[08-Mar-2014 04:30:01]  <ponicalica> so I'm fine with raising first if Alicia doesn't want to, since I think she has the lead behind 4556, so if she wants Ayako to strike first I can but
[08-Mar-2014 04:30:54]  <Hiiragi> :?
[08-Mar-2014 04:31:26]  <Hiiragi> You could also possibly add in more? I'm not sure.
[08-Mar-2014 04:31:45]  <IllFlower> It doesn't really matter to me so long as one of you does so.
[08-Mar-2014 04:31:55]  <IllFlower> For what it's worth you could justify it either way.
[08-Mar-2014 04:32:00]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi: I'm saying you can raise first if you want.
[08-Mar-2014 04:32:22]  <IllFlower> Either Hikari gets mad and retaliates or Ayako jumps in to cover for a disoriented Hikari.
[08-Mar-2014 04:33:14]  <Hiiragi> I think I'll raise first. Either way we'll each use dice eventually.
[08-Mar-2014 04:34:14]  <Hiiragi> @dice use 5 6

[08-Mar-2014 04:34:54]  <Hiiragi> Hikari, wanting to get this over with quickly, pushes back violently before slamming her staff on the guy's shoulder.
[08-Mar-2014 04:36:04]  <IllFlower> The boy quickly drops and rolls out of the way. Hikari's staff crashes into the ground, raising a small cloud of dust.

[08-Mar-2014 04:36:55]  <IllFlower> Yes. The way the group mechanics work, though, it's not going to get used.
[08-Mar-2014 04:37:07]  <Hiiragi> Interesting.
[08-Mar-2014 04:37:34]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Ayako's raise.
[08-Mar-2014 04:39:38]  <ponicalica> Ayako, seeing the scuffle, decides to run towards the boy, aiming for a tackle.

[08-Mar-2014 04:43:45]  <Hiiragi> I see greater fallout coming. D:
[08-Mar-2014 04:44:07]  <IllFlower> Ayako runs into the boy, but her momentum isn't enough to do anything other than make him stumble back a few paces.

[08-Mar-2014 04:46:41]  <IllFlower> The last girl, who up until now hasn't done much, grabs Ayako's arms and tries to throw her to the ground.

[08-Mar-2014 04:58:08]  <IllFlower> Oh, how merciful of you.
[08-Mar-2014 04:58:11]  <IllFlower> What's Hikari do?
[08-Mar-2014 04:58:26]  <Hiiragi> Is that sarcasm. Or do you want me to hurt someone.
[08-Mar-2014 04:58:50]  <Hiiragi> (Actually don't know if 42 or 45 would be a good idea.)
[08-Mar-2014 04:58:56]  <IllFlower> I mean, it's up to you.
[08-Mar-2014 04:59:06]  <IllFlower> My dice are total crap so I have to either take the blow or give.
[08-Mar-2014 04:59:20]  <Hiiragi> Mm.
[08-Mar-2014 05:00:25]  <IllFlower> I do still need to know what Hikari does in any case.
[08-Mar-2014 05:00:37]  <Hiiragi> Right, typing.
[08-Mar-2014 05:02:13]  <Hiiragi> Deciding that a little bit more force would finish this up once and for all, Hikari slams her staff down onto the guy once more, aiming for the legs.
[08-Mar-2014 05:03:05]  <IllFlower> That sounds pretty forceful for a raise of 5.
[08-Mar-2014 05:03:28]  <Hiiragi> He can counter! If he shields himself and reacts quickly enough.
[08-Mar-2014 05:03:35]  <Hiiragi> He's not totally in harm's way.
[08-Mar-2014 05:03:45]  <IllFlower> Well, yeah, but if you wanted to you could raise higher.
[08-Mar-2014 05:04:01]  <IllFlower> 5 is, like, wiffleball strength.
[08-Mar-2014 05:04:38]  <Hiiragi> Really? Well.

[08-Mar-2014 05:07:12]  <Hiiragi> But oh well.
[08-Mar-2014 05:07:23]  <IllFlower> Just as Hikari raises her staff for another strike, one of the girls shouts.
[08-Mar-2014 05:07:39]  <IllFlower> "Stop, stop! What do you want?"
[08-Mar-2014 05:07:44]  <BGTB2005> I was almost picturing Hikari poking the guy and him immediately surrendering

[08-Mar-2014 05:09:16]  <IllFlower> Hiiragi: You need to roll 3d8 fallout for Hikari.
[08-Mar-2014 05:09:29]  <Hiiragi> @roll 3d8
[08-Mar-2014 05:09:34]  <Hiiragi> Er.
[08-Mar-2014 05:09:36]  <ponicalica> it's @dice roll or +roll
[08-Mar-2014 05:09:41]  <Hiiragi> Derp.
[08-Mar-2014 05:09:44]  <Hiiragi> @dice 3d8
[08-Mar-2014 05:09:44]  <Omnipresence> 14Hiiragi: Unrecognized subcommand 3d8.
[08-Mar-2014 05:09:49]  <ponicalica> depending on whom you want to trust with your life
[08-Mar-2014 05:09:56]  <Hiiragi> Oh right.
[08-Mar-2014 05:09:59]  <Hiiragi> @dice roll 3d8
[08-Mar-2014 05:09:59]  <Omnipresence> 14Hiiragi: Rolled 2 3 7 = 12.
[08-Mar-2014 05:10:10]  <ponicalica> 10.  I think that's long-term fallout?
[08-Mar-2014 05:10:15]  <Hiiragi> Damn.
[08-Mar-2014 05:10:27]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[08-Mar-2014 05:10:32]  <ponicalica> it's 12 that you want to watch out for
[08-Mar-2014 05:10:36]  <ponicalica> since that can need medical attention
[08-Mar-2014 05:11:07]  <Hiiragi> Exactly 12, too. :v
[08-Mar-2014 05:11:19]  <ponicalica> nah, it's the sum of the top two that matters
[08-Mar-2014 05:11:27]  <Hiiragi> Gah, right.
[08-Mar-2014 05:11:28]  <IllFlower> -1 from stats, new d4 trait or relationship, add a die to an existing d4 trait or relationship, shrink a d6+ trait or relationship, remove a belonging, or take damage to your costume.
[08-Mar-2014 05:12:10]  <Hiiragi> 1d4, uncomfortable fighting?
[08-Mar-2014 05:12:37]  <Nitya> 1d4 wiffleball champion
[08-Mar-2014 05:13:07]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi: don't you kind of already have the "cracks under pressure" one
[08-Mar-2014 05:13:22]  <Hiiragi> Oh, yeah. Hm.
[08-Mar-2014 05:13:40]  <Nitya> you could add d4 to it. bam
[08-Mar-2014 05:13:54]  <Hiiragi> 2d4?
[08-Mar-2014 05:14:15]  <ponicalica> "Cracks under conflict"
[08-Mar-2014 05:14:27]  <ponicalica> so 1d4 → 2d4 for it?  I dunno, what does IllFlower think
[08-Mar-2014 05:14:56]  <IllFlower> She didn't really crack in this case, is the only thing.
[08-Mar-2014 05:15:16]  <IllFlower> I think it'd make more sense to bump down one of her other traits.
[08-Mar-2014 05:15:38]  <IllFlower> Like the conflict rush one would make sense to demote.
[08-Mar-2014 05:15:48]  *** Xeniera <~Solstace@71-222-76-51.ptld.qwest.net> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[08-Mar-2014 05:16:13]  <Hiiragi> I was thinking also, like 1d4 worried about initiative but that's kind of long, for one. First she wasn't strong enough to help with Jun, then she juust manages to fend off these folks with Ayako, but can't really do much beyond that.
[08-Mar-2014 05:16:24]  <Hiiragi> Or that. That makes more sense.
[08-Mar-2014 05:16:46]  <Hiiragi> So 1d8 to 1d4?
[08-Mar-2014 05:16:53]  <IllFlower> 1d6.
[08-Mar-2014 05:17:00]  <IllFlower> Just one die size is enough.
[08-Mar-2014 05:17:10]  * Hiiragi got confused.
[08-Mar-2014 05:17:12]  <Hiiragi> Right.
[08-Mar-2014 05:18:26]  <Hiiragi> Oh, then I gotta say the thing.
[08-Mar-2014 05:19:10]  <IllFlower> Okay, changed.
[08-Mar-2014 05:19:32]  <IllFlower> So Hikari should probably answer the poor girl's question.
[08-Mar-2014 05:19:34]  <Hiiragi> Hikari holds her position steady, glancing back at the girl. "Information, now. What are you attacking Shirakawa for, and just what are you planning at?"
[08-Mar-2014 05:20:27]  <Hiiragi> "Answer them *peacefully* too, please." she finishes, focus waning.
[08-Mar-2014 05:20:36]  <IllFlower> "We know she's after the chief."
[08-Mar-2014 05:20:46]  <ponicalica> "Of?"
[08-Mar-2014 05:22:06]  <IllFlower> The girl extends her hand out towards Ayako and Hikari, opening her fingers to reveal her palm.
[08-Mar-2014 05:22:29]  <IllFlower> In black ink on the folds of her skin is that unmistakable torch mark.
[08-Mar-2014 05:23:13]  <IllFlower> "Does that answer your question?"
[08-Mar-2014 05:25:36]  <Hiiragi> (Wouldn't that be Osada. Or.)
[08-Mar-2014 05:25:49]  <Hiiragi>  Hiiragi: Rolled 2 3 7 = 12.
[08-Mar-2014 05:26:01]  <Hiiragi> ...? Uh, sorry.
[08-Mar-2014 05:26:12]  <IllFlower> Yes, it would be.
[08-Mar-2014 05:26:21]  * Hiiragi was wiping something off of the touchpad for computer and did a thing.
[08-Mar-2014 05:27:01]  <Hiiragi> "What do you have to tell us about Osada and her plans?"
[08-Mar-2014 05:27:07]  <Hiiragi> Or, wait no.
[08-Mar-2014 05:27:32]  <IllFlower> That's not a very useful question considering Mai told the Conservators everything about that already.
[08-Mar-2014 05:27:42]  <Hiiragi> (We know, but I was thinking like straining out more. All we know is crap's going down.)
[08-Mar-2014 05:27:45]  <Hiiragi> Yeah.
[08-Mar-2014 05:27:53]  <Hiiragi> Hm.
[08-Mar-2014 05:27:54]  <Hiiragi> ponicalica?
[08-Mar-2014 05:28:35]  <IllFlower> Mai didn't mention anything about going after Satsuki, though. That's new. Possibly wrong.
[08-Mar-2014 05:29:00]  <ponicalica> "How do you know she's going after her?"
[08-Mar-2014 05:30:07]  <IllFlower> "We heard it from the chief herself," the boy chimes in. "She's been on the list for a while now."
[08-Mar-2014 05:30:22]  <IllFlower> Mai laughs derisively.
[08-Mar-2014 05:31:29]  <IllFlower> "That girl's not worth my time," Mai says. "Though what that other girl said isn't totally wrong. It's true I wouldn't care if she were to drop dead tomorrow."
[08-Mar-2014 05:31:51]  <Hiiragi>  Hiiragi: Rolled 2 3 7 = 12.
[08-Mar-2014 05:32:04]  <Hiiragi> (SORRY.)
[08-Mar-2014 05:32:35]  <IllFlower> You should probably turn off click-to-paste.
[08-Mar-2014 05:33:00]  <Hiiragi> Yes.
[08-Mar-2014 05:33:55]  <IllFlower> "Like any of us would believe someone who's getting taken away by the Conservators," the boy retorts.
[08-Mar-2014 05:36:06]  <ponicalica> "So who all is on the list?  Just Emi's associates?"
[08-Mar-2014 05:37:05]  <IllFlower> "They all deserve to be on it."
[08-Mar-2014 05:38:55]  <ponicalica> "For what?  What have they all done that they deserve to die, outside of the Order's law?"
[08-Mar-2014 05:40:14]  <IllFlower> "They've done enough."
[08-Mar-2014 05:40:20]  <IllFlower> The boy glares at Ayako, unfazed.
[08-Mar-2014 05:41:28]  <Hiiragi> Hikari glares down at the boy, tightening her grip. "Please, keep the clever remarks to yourself. And that hasn't answered our question. What did they do?"
[08-Mar-2014 05:41:42]  <Hiiragi> (As if they'll answer. >:/)
[08-Mar-2014 05:44:19]  <IllFlower> They won't. All the answer the Conservators need, they've gotten from Mai already.
[08-Mar-2014 05:44:27]  <IllFlower> It really is that petty.
[08-Mar-2014 05:44:38]  <Hiiragi> What a bunch of tools.
[08-Mar-2014 05:45:13]  <Hiiragi> ponicalica, think Ayako and Hikari are done here, or do you have anything else to say?
[08-Mar-2014 05:45:23]  <IllFlower> Class warfare, my friend.
[08-Mar-2014 05:45:55]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi: Yeah, I think at this point, we should just take Mai in.
[08-Mar-2014 05:46:56]  <IllFlower> What about the people who were just trying to kill her?
[08-Mar-2014 05:47:04]  <IllFlower> And, hey, what happened to immunity?
[08-Mar-2014 05:48:42]  <BGTB2005> She'll be safer in Conservator custody?
[08-Mar-2014 05:48:43]  <ponicalica> I was trying to make Ayako non-committal about that.  Also, you know, she's lying about her non-involvement
[08-Mar-2014 05:49:37]  <IllFlower> There's a good chance Satsuki was lying.
[08-Mar-2014 05:49:46]  <IllFlower> You can't really take anyone at face value.
[08-Mar-2014 05:51:19]  <ponicalica> Yeah, but even Mai suggested that Satsuki's group was only going after Emi's, so...
[08-Mar-2014 05:51:35]  <ponicalica> and yet she built a cube fortress
[08-Mar-2014 05:52:05]  <Hiiragi> Hikari sighs. "Thank you for your time." Then, exasperated, directs the three attackers elsewhere. "Now please leave. We will deal as we see fit from here."
[08-Mar-2014 05:52:40]  <Hiiragi> (I mean, they aren't really going to cough up anything else. And with them gone we can "deal" with Mai, I figure.)
[08-Mar-2014 05:53:36]  <IllFlower> I really do question the wisdom of letting three initiates who essentially confessed to attempted murder go.
[08-Mar-2014 05:53:47]  <Hiiragi> Hm.
[08-Mar-2014 05:53:50]  <Hiiragi> Take'em all in.
[08-Mar-2014 05:54:02]  <Hiiragi> Alt: Knock them out, and then take them in.
[08-Mar-2014 05:54:18]  <Hiiragi> Have Ayako blind them with her light.
[08-Mar-2014 05:54:22]  *** Saladofstones <~Saladofst@pool-173-51-83-42.lsanca.fios.verizon.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Stones Has It)
[08-Mar-2014 05:54:26]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: The question is how receptive would they be?  I mean, we fought them down, but for information, not arrest.
[08-Mar-2014 05:55:22]  <IllFlower> Abandoning prosecution because of effort.gif doesn't sound very Conservator-like to me!
[08-Mar-2014 05:55:58]  <Hiiragi> We can force something out. Blind'em and then I will handle them.
[08-Mar-2014 05:56:13]  <Nitya> 14imo, beat them death for resisting arrest and call it good
[08-Mar-2014 05:56:35]  <Hiiragi> Nitya, Nitya, Hikari has no reason for that *yet*.
[08-Mar-2014 05:56:50]  <Nitya> 14some cops you are.
[08-Mar-2014 05:56:56]  <Nitya> 14wow.
[08-Mar-2014 05:57:31]  <Hiiragi> Do you really expect that out of Hikari!?
[08-Mar-2014 05:57:37]  <Hiiragi> Let alone Ayako.
[08-Mar-2014 05:58:17]  <Hiiragi> ponicalica: If you want to, but I mean, I think my idea is good too.
[08-Mar-2014 05:59:26]  <ponicalica> heh.  Either way, I think if we're going to do something that IllFlower isn't going to automatic to, we should do it next session, because it's been about six hours
[08-Mar-2014 05:59:44]  <IllFlower> Only five and a half!
[08-Mar-2014 05:59:45]  <Hiiragi> Agreed.
[08-Mar-2014 05:59:49]  <Hiiragi> ^^;
[08-Mar-2014 06:00:06]  <IllFlower> Okay, we'll call it quits for tonight, then. Ayako and Hikari can make up their minds next time.
[08-Mar-2014 06:00:19]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, you two. We'll be back soon.
