[22-Nov-2014 20:19:18]  <IllFlower> Okay, we were about to stage an intervention, if I recall correctly.
[22-Nov-2014 20:19:27]  <Alicia> Yep.
[22-Nov-2014 20:19:41]  <ponicalica> ...orlando?
[22-Nov-2014 20:20:04]  <IllFlower> Yup, Orlando.
[22-Nov-2014 20:20:19]  <BGTB2005> ...I feel like i'm missing something here...
[22-Nov-2014 20:20:32]  <IllFlower> Don't you *live* in Florida?
[22-Nov-2014 20:20:41]  <BGTB2005> yes
[22-Nov-2014 20:20:43]  <BGTB2005> but still
[22-Nov-2014 20:20:48]  <IllFlower> `_`
[22-Nov-2014 20:21:07]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I take it we're all going back to Asacchi's place.
[22-Nov-2014 20:21:18]  <IllFlower> Or someplace more public, if you're worried about things blowing up.
[22-Nov-2014 20:21:27]  <ponicalica> I think Kazuki was the one in charge.
[22-Nov-2014 20:21:28]  <Rig> Nah, let's go to Asacchi's.
[22-Nov-2014 20:21:56]  <IllFlower> Then so shall it be.
[22-Nov-2014 20:22:04]  <ponicalica> fit in four conservators and however many initiates
[22-Nov-2014 20:23:01]  <IllFlower> The teacups have been replaced by a cake by the time the Conservators and Karasuma return. Asacchi seems to have pulled out another table for the rapidly increasing number of guests.
[22-Nov-2014 20:23:23]  <Rig> Asacchi is well prepared.
[22-Nov-2014 20:23:34]  <IllFlower> Miho and Ishigaki sit at one end, eyeing Karasuma with a distinct disdain.
[22-Nov-2014 20:23:43]  <ponicalica> Rin's probably sad about the lack of cookies.
[22-Nov-2014 20:23:51]  <IllFlower> I'll let one of you folks open the proceedings.
[22-Nov-2014 20:24:17]  <Alicia> I think Kazuki is best for this.
[22-Nov-2014 20:24:21]  <ponicalica> same
[22-Nov-2014 20:24:31]  <BGTB2005> yeah

[22-Nov-2014 20:26:53]  <IllFlower> ("Kazuki pulls out a copy of Diplomacy, the board game.")
[22-Nov-2014 20:27:13]  <Rig> Kazuki sits near Karasuma, his cake untouched. "Asacchi, we were told that Karasuma was harassing your initiates. We tracked him down and found him being beaten by another group. It seems that a lot of this situation is a misunderstanding. Karasuma tells us that your other initiates have been holding his previous actions against him. We'd like to clear the air and make sure everyone is on the same page."
[22-Nov-2014 20:27:38]  <ponicalica> pulling out Diplomacy seems like it'd only be a good idea if you were trying to stoke tensions
[22-Nov-2014 20:28:05]  <BGTB2005> but what if that was his plan all along?
[22-Nov-2014 20:28:52]  <ponicalica> it was the result of his plans in Antigone Branch
[22-Nov-2014 20:30:20]  <IllFlower> Asacchi nods. "A misunderstanding would be better than the alternative."
[22-Nov-2014 20:30:48]  <ponicalica> "That they understand perfectly well what's going on?"
[22-Nov-2014 20:31:29]  <IllFlower> "And that someone here is actually acting with malicious intent."
[22-Nov-2014 20:31:52]  <IllFlower> Karasuma stares obliquely at Asacchi. His mind appears to be half elsewhere.
[22-Nov-2014 20:33:16]  <Rig> Man, I cannot find the character sheet suddenly.
[22-Nov-2014 20:33:25]  <IllFlower> It's linked from the wiki page.
[22-Nov-2014 20:35:03]  <Rig> "Miho," Kazuki begins. "Karasuma says that you threatened him."
[22-Nov-2014 20:36:25]  <IllFlower> "Threatened?" Miho echoes.
[22-Nov-2014 20:37:07]  <Rig> Kazuki looks to Karasuma for confirmation, but finds little help. "He said something like, 'She said she'd like to see me dead.'"
[22-Nov-2014 20:37:20]  <Rig> He said she said: The RP
[22-Nov-2014 20:39:16]  <IllFlower> "That I did. It hardly counts as a threat, though."
[22-Nov-2014 20:40:56]  <Rig> "Maybe to some people, but it still doesn't exactly foster teamwork." Kazuki glances at Rin briefly. "Is there a reason you can't work with Karasuma?"
[22-Nov-2014 20:41:43]  <IllFlower> "I thought you knew about his history."
[22-Nov-2014 20:42:44]  <Rig> "I know that he has been punished for it."
[22-Nov-2014 20:44:04]  <IllFlower> "I don't care," Miho counters.
[22-Nov-2014 20:45:14]  <Rig> "It isn't your place to punish him again. You're not a Conservator or a Prophet. Unless Asacchi told you to threaten Karasuma you shouldn't have."
[22-Nov-2014 20:45:35]  <ponicalica> ("Okay, now Miho, please tell Karasuma you'd rather see him dead")

[22-Nov-2014 20:46:24]  <IllFlower> "He was part of something that *killed* *people*, Sakura," Miho says forcefully. "People *I* knew.
[22-Nov-2014 20:46:42]  <IllFlower> "As far as I'm concerned, he has no right to be sitting there in front of me."
[22-Nov-2014 20:48:17]  <IllFlower> "*I* didn't kill anyone," Karasuma suddenly snaps back. His eyes seem to be trying to fire lasers through Miho's skull.
[22-Nov-2014 20:48:44]  <Rig> (He succeeds)
[22-Nov-2014 20:48:51]  <IllFlower> "You might as well have!" Miho shouts back.
[22-Nov-2014 20:49:33]  <ponicalica> "If we hadn't been there with Mai, would you have killed her?"
[22-Nov-2014 20:49:41]  <IllFlower> "Don't think you can wash your hands of it just because you didn't pull the trigger!"
[22-Nov-2014 20:51:03]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Karasuma falls silent, though he continues to glare at Miho.
[22-Nov-2014 20:51:28]  <Rig> Kazuki glares at Ayako before snapping back to Miho, "Look, you cannot hand out vigilante justice! Karasuma commited crimes. He was punished for those crimes. Can you not handle that? Do you feel the need to take revenge on him?"
[22-Nov-2014 20:52:43]  <IllFlower> "Entirely justified revenge," Miho answers curtly.
[22-Nov-2014 20:53:41]  *** AttObl is now known as AttObl|Chivalry
[22-Nov-2014 20:56:03]  <Rig> Kazuki shakes his head.
[22-Nov-2014 20:57:51]  <IllFlower> "What do you know?" Miho asks Kazuki. "How many friends have you lost?
[22-Nov-2014 20:58:29]  <IllFlower> "Let me tell you, nobody deserves to die the way mine did."
[22-Nov-2014 20:58:39]  <Rig> "I know the difference between justice and petty violence to satisfy yourself."
[22-Nov-2014 20:58:55]  <Rig> "I watched one of my best friends beaten to a pulp by the people I'm supposed to trust my life to."
[22-Nov-2014 20:59:27]  <Rig> "If I turned around and told them that I was going to watch them die happily what do you think would happen to me?"
[22-Nov-2014 20:59:40]  <Rig> *happily watch them die
[22-Nov-2014 21:00:08]  <ponicalica> how many times will Kazuki be able to get in a shot against the girls
[22-Nov-2014 21:00:27]  <IllFlower> Miho laughs.
[22-Nov-2014 21:00:28]  <Rig> "What do you think is happened to you, Miho?" Kazuki frowns. "Do you think this is the kind of remembrance that your friends would want? One wrapped up in violence?" 
[22-Nov-2014 21:00:34]  <Rig> *happening to you
[22-Nov-2014 21:01:44]  <IllFlower> "So Takanashi's dead," she says, counting off on her fingers, "I've been dishonorably discharged, and now all that's left in the ranks of the Conservators are lunatics."
[22-Nov-2014 21:02:34]  <ponicalica> "Takanashi?  Like, Jun Takanashi?"
[22-Nov-2014 21:02:52]  <Rig> "You were discharged for a reason," Kazuki mutters.
[22-Nov-2014 21:03:01]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: "One and the same."
[22-Nov-2014 21:04:56]  <ponicalica> Ayako now remembers the scene of the trainyard, and tears begin to show in her eyes.  She tries to wipe them off discreetly.  "You knew her?"
[22-Nov-2014 21:06:02]  <IllFlower> "She was my partner as a Conservator."
[22-Nov-2014 21:07:11]  <IllFlower> Ishigaki, disconcerted, tries to whisper something to Miho, but she brushes it off.
[22-Nov-2014 21:07:41]  <ponicalica> Ayako looks to Miho, then to Hikari, trying to figure out what she can even say.
[22-Nov-2014 21:09:30]  <Rig> Kazuki stares at his piece of cake. "Asacchi, how many initiates do you have at the moment?"
[22-Nov-2014 21:09:36]  <IllFlower> Miho raises a finger and jabs it in Karasuma's direction. "And he was part of the cult that killed her."
[22-Nov-2014 21:10:03]  <IllFlower> Rig: "Ten," Asacchi responds in a low voice.
[22-Nov-2014 21:12:36]  <Rig> Kazuki ignores Miho at the moment. "Perhaps some transfers are in order?"

[22-Nov-2014 21:12:53]  <Alicia> Hikari, unusually, spends her time staring at the wall between Ishigaki and Miho. Miho's stuck in her ways... but it's not like she'd listen to her anyway.
[22-Nov-2014 21:13:16]  <Rig> Ah, but Hikari should shout at Miho about justice.
[22-Nov-2014 21:13:40]  <IllFlower> Asacchi starts to answer, but is interrupted by the sound of a plate smashing against the table.

[22-Nov-2014 21:14:15]  <ponicalica> oh no
[22-Nov-2014 21:14:16]  <Rig> How dare whomever did that!
[22-Nov-2014 21:14:48]  <IllFlower> Karasuma is standing now, glass fragments scattered in a loose arc in front of him.
[22-Nov-2014 21:15:19]  <Alicia> She rubs her temples, starting to get a headache. "Miho, you're not the only one who has issues with him. We did find him-"
[22-Nov-2014 21:15:55]  <IllFlower> His hands are balled into fists, and he looks about ready to leap over the table at Miho.
[22-Nov-2014 21:16:20]  <Alicia> "Karasuma, stop! We're trying to help you, what do you think you're doing!?"
[22-Nov-2014 21:16:39]  <Alicia> you and your group*
[22-Nov-2014 21:18:13]  <IllFlower> "I'm sick of this.

[22-Nov-2014 21:18:32]  <IllFlower> "Two can play at that game."
[22-Nov-2014 21:20:02]  <Rig> "Karasuma, stop!"
[22-Nov-2014 21:21:12]  <ponicalica> (kazuki: "come on, dude, i'm trying to help you.  is anyone other than me not a lunatic")
[22-Nov-2014 21:22:19]  <ponicalica> So, a conflict to keep the two of them apart?  Would that even work?
[22-Nov-2014 21:22:50]  <Alicia> See who yells the loudest
[22-Nov-2014 21:23:19]  <BGTB2005> "Karasuma, I can understand what you're going through. You acting like this won't fix anything."
[22-Nov-2014 21:24:27]  <IllFlower> "It's not like anything else has," Karasuma says. His eyes don't even stray towards Rin.
[22-Nov-2014 21:27:36]  <Rig> "Karasuma, there is no point in fighting Miho."
[22-Nov-2014 21:28:37]  <Rig> "I think we need to step back. Miho is... far more invested in your situation than I imagined."
[22-Nov-2014 21:29:44]  <IllFlower> Karasuma looks in Kazuki's direction for a moment. He remains standing, but some of the tension in his body seems to ease.
[22-Nov-2014 21:31:51]  <Rig> Okay, how should we handle this?
[22-Nov-2014 21:32:23]  <IllFlower> Mud wrestling.
[22-Nov-2014 21:32:33]  <Alicia> Try and get Miho to chill? She seems like the bigger issue than Karasuma. Maybe.
[22-Nov-2014 21:32:39]  <Alicia> They both need to chill.
[22-Nov-2014 21:32:48]  <Alicia> Everybody needs to chill.
[22-Nov-2014 21:32:52]  <ponicalica> Karasuma's the one that broke Asacchi's plate though
[22-Nov-2014 21:33:06]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Uuh
[22-Nov-2014 21:34:44]  <Rig> Miho is certainly the bigger problem.
[22-Nov-2014 21:34:59]  <Rig> We could enter a conflict with her, but I'm not sure what it would be about.
[22-Nov-2014 21:35:04]  <Alicia> I know! Let's have Hikari talk to her!
[22-Nov-2014 21:35:10]  <Alicia> (No let's not. That'll make it worse.)
[22-Nov-2014 21:35:13]  <Rig> Nah.
[22-Nov-2014 21:35:17]  <BGTB2005> more reason to do it
[22-Nov-2014 21:35:22]  <Rig> I like the idea of Hikari and Miho having a talking conflict.
[22-Nov-2014 21:35:32]  <Rig> Maybe outside the apartment briefly?
[22-Nov-2014 21:36:03]  <Alicia> That still leaves the whole what it's about though.
[22-Nov-2014 21:36:15]  <Alicia> Otherwise I'm good just a bit confused
[22-Nov-2014 21:36:15]  <Alicia> >_>;
[22-Nov-2014 21:36:20]  <ponicalica> try to convince her to let up on Karasuma
[22-Nov-2014 21:36:21]  <BGTB2005> convincing her to leave Karasuma alone?
[22-Nov-2014 21:36:40]  <Alicia> Sure.
[22-Nov-2014 21:36:59]  <Rig> Convincing her that she isn't actually justified in her revenge or something.
[22-Nov-2014 21:37:05]  <Rig> Of course, if you fail...
[22-Nov-2014 21:37:33]  <ponicalica> punch your best friend's sister
[22-Nov-2014 21:37:56]  <Alicia> Well, it's not like just Hikari would make things worse if she failed.
[22-Nov-2014 21:38:02]  <Alicia> Kazuki could also make things worse etc.
[22-Nov-2014 21:38:09]  <Alicia> could make*
[22-Nov-2014 21:38:46]  <IllFlower> I dunno if one conflict is enough for convincing Miho to leave Karasuma alone.
[22-Nov-2014 21:38:54]  <IllFlower> She has some deep-seated anger.
[22-Nov-2014 21:39:03]  <Rig> Okay, lower stakes then?
[22-Nov-2014 21:39:17]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[22-Nov-2014 21:40:05]  <Rig> I'm not sure what a good lower stake is. What do we want to accomplish?
[22-Nov-2014 21:40:30]  <Rig> I suppose getting Miho and Karasuma to not kill each other is the end goal.
[22-Nov-2014 21:40:53]  <Alicia> We want her to at least try to work with Karasuma. So here wouldn't we want her to... let up? Not sure how to phrase it
[22-Nov-2014 21:40:58]  <IllFlower> Maybe you can convince her that it's not worth it for the moment.
[22-Nov-2014 21:41:04]  <Alicia> At least listen to Kazuki instead of snapping back or something.
[22-Nov-2014 21:41:39]  <Rig> Yeah, convincing her to calm down and at least listen would be a nice start.
[22-Nov-2014 21:41:42]  <IllFlower> Or get her to talk to the Conservators instead of trying to start something with Karasuma.

[22-Nov-2014 21:54:34]  <IllFlower> Relationship with Junpei doesn't matter either for much the same reasons.
[22-Nov-2014 21:56:18]  <Alicia> ponicalica: I can't use Junpei/Ayako, though, so using Relationships are out of the question
[22-Nov-2014 21:57:57]  <BGTB2005> I don't think there's much stopping you from assigning one of your unused relationships to Miho
[22-Nov-2014 21:58:04]  <ponicalica> there's not~
[22-Nov-2014 21:58:11]  <Alicia> Oh.
[22-Nov-2014 21:58:25]  <ponicalica> I think you usually wait until you're about to use the relationship though
[22-Nov-2014 21:58:34]  <Alicia> But doesn't that have to occur after/before conflicts though
[22-Nov-2014 21:58:41]  <ponicalica> nope, it happens during conflicts
[22-Nov-2014 21:59:02]  <ponicalica> Rig did that for Jun, for instance
[22-Nov-2014 21:59:34]  <Alicia> Oh. Could I take a d6 from Ayako, then. The only other options don't seem to make sense
[22-Nov-2014 21:59:44]  <Alicia> I mean, having a higher Rel die than your best frand and all.
[22-Nov-2014 21:59:46]  <IllFlower> You can't alter existing relationships.
[22-Nov-2014 21:59:54]  <ponicalica> nope, you have to us ethe d8s or d10s, and it'll be a relationship you gain during the fight
[22-Nov-2014 22:00:04]  <Alicia> 1d8 then.
[22-Nov-2014 22:00:13]  <ponicalica> like, the conflict is probably what spurred at least some of having more interest in Miho than Junpei
[22-Nov-2014 22:00:42]  <Alicia> Makes sense.
[22-Nov-2014 22:00:47]  <Alicia> @dice add 1d8
[22-Nov-2014 22:00:47]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Rolled 7 = 7. Bank now has 1 1 2 3 3 4 6 7 = 27.
[22-Nov-2014 22:01:44]  <Alicia> Nice.
[22-Nov-2014 22:03:35]  <Alicia> "Miho, listen to us. You're still with the group, and that means working with people, even if you hate them."

[22-Nov-2014 22:08:58]  <Alicia> What a rude implication. Or not-even-implication. Wanting to add in 2d6 feelings
[22-Nov-2014 22:09:08]  <ponicalica> I think that's justifiable
[22-Nov-2014 22:09:18]  <ponicalica> depending on what you use it for
[22-Nov-2014 22:09:33]  <Alicia> Dropping the politeness even more
[22-Nov-2014 22:09:40]  <Alicia> At least for Hikari Standards
[22-Nov-2014 22:09:45]  <Alicia> @dice add 2d6
[22-Nov-2014 22:09:45]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Rolled 3 5 = 8. Bank now has 1 1 2 3 3 3 5 7 = 25.
[22-Nov-2014 22:12:57]  <IllFlower> You should mention how you're raising before adding dice.
[22-Nov-2014 22:13:08]  <ponicalica> Won't that be a see anyways?
[22-Nov-2014 22:13:21]  <BGTB2005> either way
[22-Nov-2014 22:13:26]  <ponicalica> though I guess here you might use the same response for both see and raise
[22-Nov-2014 22:13:34]  <Alicia> Hikari's face turns slightly red at the thought. "Miho, what are you - are you so stuck in your place that you think I'm taking his side!? I don't like him either! But refusing to even so much as think of cooperating is just going to bring down Asacchi's group!"
[22-Nov-2014 22:13:38]  <Alicia> Urk, sorry

[22-Nov-2014 22:15:50]  <IllFlower> I'm not sure that hurt Miho's feelings enough, haha.
[22-Nov-2014 22:16:34]  <Alicia> I'm sorry I'm honestly not good at being rude. I thought the implications of "it's ur fault, even though he killed your teammate" was enough, in a sense
[22-Nov-2014 22:16:59]  <Alicia> I'll try to step it up in the responses, sorry
[22-Nov-2014 22:17:02]  <BGTB2005> maybe telling Miho she isn't much better than Karasuma?
[22-Nov-2014 22:17:09]  <ponicalica> yeah' that could work
[22-Nov-2014 22:17:22]  <ponicalica> ("you wanted karasuma to die like he did mai")
[22-Nov-2014 22:17:29]  <Alicia> Well Miho didn't actually harm anyone, so that'd be...
[22-Nov-2014 22:17:35]  <ponicalica> neither did karasuma
[22-Nov-2014 22:17:36]  <Alicia> Well, actually.

[22-Nov-2014 22:19:01]  <BGTB2005> right now, Karasuma
[22-Nov-2014 22:19:41]  <IllFlower> Anyway, let's move on with the conflict.
[22-Nov-2014 22:19:55]  <ponicalica> it's Hikari's raise, right?
[22-Nov-2014 22:20:34]  <IllFlower> Indeed it is.

[22-Nov-2014 22:21:41]  <ponicalica> ARe you going to talk or are you implying using the other line?
[22-Nov-2014 22:22:01]  <Alicia> I was working on another thing
[22-Nov-2014 22:23:21]  <ponicalica> you should do that before using the dice
[22-Nov-2014 22:24:41]  <Alicia> "You talk about all of the bad things he did, then vindictively turn around and talk about how you'd do the same!" Hikari returns, yelling now. Miho's been on her mind too much recently. "Yes, he was a follower. but nothing more than that. A simple tool!"
[22-Nov-2014 22:25:38]  <IllFlower> ("no *ur* a tool")

[22-Nov-2014 22:26:39]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: are you saying you think hikari is a toll
[22-Nov-2014 22:26:41]  <ponicalica> *tool
[22-Nov-2014 22:26:54]  <Alicia> Misread that as doll.

[22-Nov-2014 22:27:38]  <IllFlower> "What difference does that make? So he was stupid. That doesn't make him any less responsible for what he did and who he did it with. I didn't come here to appease an attempted murderer."
[22-Nov-2014 22:27:52]  <IllFlower> Assigning that 2d8 to "uncompromising."
[22-Nov-2014 22:28:06]  <IllFlower> @dice add 2d8

[22-Nov-2014 22:28:24]  <Alicia> Owww.
[22-Nov-2014 22:30:06]  <Alicia> Hrm, could add in 1d6 law, possibly. Not sure how to work it in beyond Hikari thinking she's right as usual, though
[22-Nov-2014 22:30:36]  <BGTB2005> isn't that what it's there for?
[22-Nov-2014 22:30:38]  <IllFlower> "I want him gone," Miho finishes, "and if you're too much of a coward to make that happen, I will."
[22-Nov-2014 22:30:44]  <IllFlower> @dice use 2 5
[22-Nov-2014 22:30:44]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 2 5 = 7. Bank now has 2 2 2 2 3 3 = 14.
[22-Nov-2014 22:31:11]  <Alicia> Further ow!
[22-Nov-2014 22:31:25]  <ponicalica> poor hikari
[22-Nov-2014 22:32:30]  <Alicia> Okay, so I want to add in law, since how could Hikari be wrong. really.
[22-Nov-2014 22:32:47]  <IllFlower> Give us an action that embodies law and you can do so!
[22-Nov-2014 22:32:57]  <ponicalica> the law thing maybe you could respond with if miho did that she'd be in violation?
[22-Nov-2014 22:33:38]  <IllFlower> ("If you cross me, I *will* make you regret it.")
[22-Nov-2014 22:37:12]  <Alicia> Hikari grits her teeth, trying to ignore the slight tears popping up. "Fine... Fine then! Go in, talk about how you won't accept this! Go against the Order you care so dearly about being away from, get your pointless revenge!" She catches herself, it's not like she wants him dead. "Go through me, and see if it was even worth it!"
[22-Nov-2014 22:37:17]  <Alicia> @dice add 1d6
[22-Nov-2014 22:37:17]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Rolled 3 = 3. Bank now has 1 1 2 3 3 = 10.

[22-Nov-2014 22:38:03]  <Alicia> "Actually... just go, damn it!" Hikari points to the door, staring Miho down.
[22-Nov-2014 22:38:05]  <ponicalica> 3d4 fallout
[22-Nov-2014 22:38:51]  <Alicia> I want to fold.
[22-Nov-2014 22:39:09]  <Alicia> Not much else to bring in, and it's stacked against me anyway, what with Miho's other traits to bring in.
[22-Nov-2014 22:39:12]  <Rig> You can give without taking the fallout.
[22-Nov-2014 22:39:56]  <Alicia> Then I'll do that, I guess.
[22-Nov-2014 22:40:08]  <BGTB2005> but it's only d4
[22-Nov-2014 22:40:11]  <ponicalica> eh, it's d4 fallout, so it's really alicia's choice
[22-Nov-2014 22:40:34]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but if she gives after taking fallout, she can keep a 2!
[22-Nov-2014 22:41:12]  <Alicia> I'll take it.
[22-Nov-2014 22:42:23]  <IllFlower> Okay, go ahead and roll that fallout now.
[22-Nov-2014 22:42:44]  <Alicia> +roll 3d4
[22-Nov-2014 22:42:44]  <rollermine> Alicia: (4+2+2)=8
[22-Nov-2014 22:42:52]  <ponicalica> 6.
[22-Nov-2014 22:43:00]  <ponicalica> So that's one short term?
[22-Nov-2014 22:43:48]  <IllFlower> Yes.
[22-Nov-2014 22:43:51]  <Alicia> Yep.
[22-Nov-2014 22:44:55]  <IllFlower> You could d4 the relationship with Miho.
[22-Nov-2014 22:45:32]  <Alicia> I was just thinking of that, actually. It'd be the thing most strongly affected.
[22-Nov-2014 22:47:04]  <IllFlower> Done.
[22-Nov-2014 22:47:29]  <IllFlower> "Don't mind if I do," Miho says coldly, sweeping back into Asacchi's apartment.
[22-Nov-2014 22:48:28]  <Alicia> Hikari forcefully shuts the door behind her, choosing to stay away from Miho and Karasuma.
[22-Nov-2014 22:48:42]  <IllFlower> That's also a short-term fallout item, lol.
[22-Nov-2014 22:48:52]  <Alicia> Frig
[22-Nov-2014 22:49:09]  <Alicia> Then can I just do that instead, please?
[22-Nov-2014 22:51:01]  <Alicia> Last thing she wants, by this point, is to even be in the same room as her and Karasuma (but mostly Miho).
[22-Nov-2014 22:51:28]  <IllFlower> Okay, done.
[22-Nov-2014 22:52:00]  <IllFlower> Miho retakes her seat at the table, ignoring the stares of the others.
[22-Nov-2014 22:52:37]  <Rig> That went well.
[22-Nov-2014 22:52:52]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Thanks.
[22-Nov-2014 22:53:13]  <Rig> By the time Miho comes in Karasuma's plate shards have been cleared away by Asacchi (who is carrying the dustpan into the kitchen).
[22-Nov-2014 22:53:22]  <BGTB2005> so...
[22-Nov-2014 22:55:47]  <IllFlower> So.
[22-Nov-2014 22:55:55]  <IllFlower> This one's on the rest of the group...
[22-Nov-2014 22:56:02]  <Rig> Hm
[22-Nov-2014 22:56:07]  <ponicalica> hm
[22-Nov-2014 22:56:14]  <Alicia> Hm
[22-Nov-2014 22:56:30]  <ponicalica> "Did Hikari convince you to trust the Order on Karasuma?"
[22-Nov-2014 22:57:49]  <IllFlower> Blunt.
[22-Nov-2014 22:57:52]  <Rig> Very
[22-Nov-2014 22:58:10]  <IllFlower> Miho scoffs.
[22-Nov-2014 22:58:38]  <IllFlower> "I assume you mean 'trusting that he'll be taken care of.'"
[22-Nov-2014 23:02:05]  <Rig> Kazuki can't tell if she means "taken care of" in the mob hit squad way or in the "was punished already" way.
[22-Nov-2014 23:02:09]  <IllFlower> Karasuma, who the other Conservators have managed to sit back down for now, fires back.
[22-Nov-2014 23:02:16]  <IllFlower> "What do you mean, 'taken care of'?"
[22-Nov-2014 23:04:47]  <IllFlower> "Exactly what it sounds like," Miho answers.
[22-Nov-2014 23:05:13]  <Rig> Kazuki sighs. Threats again. He could have sworn the Order had no published manual on how to threaten people.
[22-Nov-2014 23:05:47]  <ponicalica> ("Actually, if you look in the right section in the library..."
[22-Nov-2014 23:06:25]  <Rig> "Perhaps we should split this group up." Kazuki suggests.
[22-Nov-2014 23:06:45]  <Rig> What is the typical size of a group of initiates?
[22-Nov-2014 23:07:19]  <IllFlower> There isn't one, really.
[22-Nov-2014 23:08:02]  <Rig> "Asacchi, would you be opposed to having a lighter load of initiates?"
[22-Nov-2014 23:09:19]  <IllFlower> "No, not particularly," the familiar says.
[22-Nov-2014 23:11:38]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at Miho and Karasuma who are still glaring at each other.
[22-Nov-2014 23:12:55]  <Rig> "Would you be satisfied being further way from Karasuma, Miho?"
[22-Nov-2014 23:13:20]  <IllFlower> "I hope you're not asking *me* to move."
[22-Nov-2014 23:13:53]  <Alicia> (Huh, the group really wants to make Miho angry.)
[22-Nov-2014 23:14:47]  <Rig> "We'll figure out movement later, right now I just want to know if that would solve some of these problems."
[22-Nov-2014 23:15:23]  <IllFlower> Before Miho can say anything, Karasuma interrupts.
[22-Nov-2014 23:15:30]  <IllFlower> "I'll take it."
[22-Nov-2014 23:17:02]  <ponicalica> does that make this the second arc where the Conservators' failures are made up for by initiate transfers?

[22-Nov-2014 23:24:37]  <IllFlower> Miho remains silent, simply staring at the others.
[22-Nov-2014 23:24:59]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at Rin and Ayako, wondering if they have anything to say about this.
[22-Nov-2014 23:26:11]  <ponicalica> "And if some other initiate decides they don't like Karasuma being returned?"
[22-Nov-2014 23:26:38]  <Rig> "I believe we'd have trouble finding an initiate with such a reluctance as Miho has."
[22-Nov-2014 23:30:14]  <ponicalica> "Maybe, but I'm not sure this will actually solve the problem.  Better than nothing, I guess..."
[22-Nov-2014 23:30:21]  <ponicalica> (osrry for not being as active this session)
[22-Nov-2014 23:30:39]  <BGTB2005> (maybe you need more hype)

[22-Nov-2014 23:31:06]  <BGTB2005> (...though I haven't really done much either...)
[22-Nov-2014 23:31:14]  <Rig> "It's better than more violence," Kazuki says under his breath. "If this is an acceptable solution to everyone then we should put it in action."
[22-Nov-2014 23:34:10]  <IllFlower> Karasuma nods.
[22-Nov-2014 23:34:24]  <IllFlower> Miho continues to say nothing, but is at least not actively objecting.
[22-Nov-2014 23:34:35]  <Rig> Okay, what's the next step?
[22-Nov-2014 23:35:34]  <IllFlower> Ishigaki's been here, but I guess he's been reduced to an inert blob.
[22-Nov-2014 23:35:53]  <Alicia> Heh.
[22-Nov-2014 23:36:03]  <Rig> Yeah, I remembered, but I wasn't certain if he had a vested interest in this.
[22-Nov-2014 23:36:09]  <Rig> he just seemed caught in the middle.
[22-Nov-2014 23:36:15]  <ponicalica> he doesn't like karasuma either, but not as much as Miho I think
[22-Nov-2014 23:37:11]  <IllFlower> I'm sure he doesn't want to get punched anymore, even if he vaguely deserves it.
[22-Nov-2014 23:37:45]  <Rig> Problem solved for the inert punching bag.
[22-Nov-2014 23:39:19]  <IllFlower> Wonderful.
[22-Nov-2014 23:39:39]  <Rig> I feel like I've driven way too much of this session. 
[22-Nov-2014 23:39:49]  <IllFlower> Someone should probably do something so they're not all just sitting in a room like Alvin Lucier.
[22-Nov-2014 23:40:07]  <ponicalica> Rig: I've been sort of unsure of how to act this session, tbh
[22-Nov-2014 23:40:12]  <Rig> "We should go make sure this is all cleared with the Order."
[22-Nov-2014 23:40:37]  <Alicia> Rig: For part of it I wasn't sure what to say, but I also didn't really do a good job/find a good way to talk about how Hikari'd rather not be there, sorry.
[22-Nov-2014 23:42:07]  <IllFlower> If you were sure, this wouldn't be a particularly interesting session, now would it?
[22-Nov-2014 23:42:10]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[22-Nov-2014 23:42:34]  <IllFlower> Does anyone want to make any last stinging remarks?
[22-Nov-2014 23:42:40]  <Rig> Miho smells.
[22-Nov-2014 23:42:59]  <Rig> And will almost certainly try to kill Karasuma or something.
[22-Nov-2014 23:43:30]  <ponicalica> yeah I kind of expect the next session to be Miho killing Karasuma anyways or something
[22-Nov-2014 23:44:14]  <BGTB2005> yeah probably
[22-Nov-2014 23:44:15]  <IllFlower> Not if you get him out of her sight fast enough!
[22-Nov-2014 23:44:43]  <Rig> So, where to next?
[22-Nov-2014 23:44:48]  <Rig> Or what do we do next?
[22-Nov-2014 23:46:30]  <IllFlower> We haven't really closed the current scene.
[22-Nov-2014 23:46:41]  <ponicalica> I think I'm willing to wrap up the session after closing up the scene, tbh
[22-Nov-2014 23:47:02]  <Rig> I'm not sure how to close the scene. Kazuki suggested clearing this with the Order.
[22-Nov-2014 23:47:32]  <IllFlower> I'd suggest not leaving Karasuma here, for starters.
[22-Nov-2014 23:47:41]  <Rig> Good point.
[22-Nov-2014 23:48:03]  <Alicia> So now we're his escorts?
[22-Nov-2014 23:48:10]  <Rig> "Karasuma, you should come with us so we can figure out where we can assign you."
[22-Nov-2014 23:49:47]  <IllFlower> Karasuma nods again.
[22-Nov-2014 23:50:06]  <IllFlower> He takes one last look at Miho before getting up and following Kazuki to the door.
[22-Nov-2014 23:51:18]  <ponicalica> Ayako walks over to the balcony to talk to Hikari
[22-Nov-2014 23:51:33]  <ponicalica> to tell her of the other Conservators leaving
[22-Nov-2014 23:51:38]  <Rig> Kazuki stops at the door and turns to Asacchi. "Thank you. I'm sorry about your plate. The cake was delicious."
[22-Nov-2014 23:51:46]  <Rig> Kazuki's cake sits untouched at his plate.
[22-Nov-2014 23:52:12]  <Alicia> Hikari nods absentmindedly and follows Ayako out, moving on ahead without looking back.
[22-Nov-2014 23:53:03]  <IllFlower> The door shuts quietly behind the group as Rin shuffles out.
[22-Nov-2014 23:53:46]  <IllFlower> "Right, so," Karasuma starts, "what are you actually going to do with me?"
[22-Nov-2014 23:54:54]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at Karasuma and sighs. "Miho is rather fixated on taking revenge it seems. For now, the plan is to keep you away from her."
[22-Nov-2014 23:55:15]  <IllFlower> "That's all?"
[22-Nov-2014 23:55:19]  <ponicalica> "I'm following his lead; the last time, when I didn't, it didn't end up well.  I think the plan is to transfer you, though maybe Kazuki secretly has another plan..."
[22-Nov-2014 23:55:39]  <Rig> "I think transferring you to another group would be a good solution for now."
[22-Nov-2014 23:55:48]  <Rig> "Were you serious about being okay with that?"
[22-Nov-2014 23:57:54]  <IllFlower> "I'm not too attached to my current group," Karasuma deadpans.
[22-Nov-2014 23:57:58]  <BGTB2005> "It's Sakura what are you expecting," Rin mutters in response to Ayako
[23-Nov-2014 00:00:19]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at his team, "Any objections or other ideas?"
[23-Nov-2014 00:01:03]  <IllFlower> Does the Order have witness protection?
[23-Nov-2014 00:01:35]  <Rig> Aren't we that?
[23-Nov-2014 00:01:48]  <BGTB2005> I thought we were magical cops
[23-Nov-2014 00:02:01]  <Rig> So we need the magical FBI.
[23-Nov-2014 00:02:31]  <Alicia> Hikari shakes her head, stepping ahead. "No. Let's go. The Order will be able to handle this."
[23-Nov-2014 00:03:00]  <Rig> Hikari takes charge!
[23-Nov-2014 00:03:49]  <Alicia> She stops. "Well?" Her tone is icy and impatient.
[23-Nov-2014 00:03:58]  <IllFlower> Off the Conservators go, then.
[23-Nov-2014 00:04:13]  <Rig> Hehehe.
[23-Nov-2014 00:04:20]  <IllFlower> I think we can bring this branch to a close.
[23-Nov-2014 00:04:36]  <Rig> Can we? I imagine we'll return to this conflict.
[23-Nov-2014 00:05:24]  <ponicalica> Yeah, but I think the return to this conflict will probably be its own arc, maybe?
[23-Nov-2014 00:05:29]  <BGTB2005> I think it's possible we could revisit it in a future branch?
[23-Nov-2014 00:05:34]  <IllFlower> Well, unless you want to put Miho and Karasuma under 24-hour surveillance, I think it's time to let go.
[23-Nov-2014 00:05:53]  <Rig> Heh.
[23-Nov-2014 00:05:58]  <Rig> Okay.
[23-Nov-2014 00:06:09]  <Rig> Did this go as expected, IllFlower?
[23-Nov-2014 00:06:28]  <IllFlower> I didn't really expect anything in particular.
[23-Nov-2014 00:06:36]  <IllFlower> I'm glad nobody got hideously injured!
[23-Nov-2014 00:06:53]  <IllFlower> Why don't we do some post-branch reflection?
[23-Nov-2014 00:07:07]  <Alicia> Phew.
[23-Nov-2014 00:07:25]  <Rig> That was significantly different from our previous arcs.
[23-Nov-2014 00:07:25]  <IllFlower> We've got reflection fallout for you on page 121 of the manual.
[23-Nov-2014 00:07:36]  <ponicalica> I should actually get going, really.  I have grading I need to do.
[23-Nov-2014 00:08:09]  <IllFlower> All right, we'll catch up on your changes later.
[23-Nov-2014 00:08:34]  <Alicia> I'm just a bit too tired, but I'll be thinking on this. >_>;
[23-Nov-2014 00:08:37]  <IllFlower> Rig: I guess it was something of an unintentional success, then.
[23-Nov-2014 00:08:55]  <Rig> Yeah, it was slower, but I'm not sure that's a bad thing.
[23-Nov-2014 00:09:02]  <Rig> We at least haven't killed anyone.
[23-Nov-2014 00:09:30]  <Rig> I'd like to boost one of my stats.
[23-Nov-2014 00:09:30]  <Alicia> Yay.
[23-Nov-2014 00:09:41]  <IllFlower> The arc was originally a lot less subtle, as I've mentioned.
[23-Nov-2014 00:10:12]  <IllFlower> It's always fun to make the players take a good, hard look at the situation, though.
[23-Nov-2014 00:10:20]  <IllFlower> Rig: Which?
[23-Nov-2014 00:10:29]  <Rig> I'd like Ac, but I'm not sure it's justified.
[23-Nov-2014 00:13:53]  <Rig> I have to go. Sorry.
[23-Nov-2014 00:14:01]  *** Rig <~Iverum@c-50-148-120-29.hsd1.in.comcast.net> has quit IRC
[23-Nov-2014 00:14:39]  <BGTB2005> I'm not sure what to do
[23-Nov-2014 00:16:46]  <Alicia> I kind of want to raise Ht, what with her aiming for talking things out and seeking peaceful resoultions... though she wasn't very good, and lost her cool. Hrm.
[23-Nov-2014 00:19:13]  <BGTB2005> I kinda want to add a new d6 relationship with Karasuma, but I'm not too sure how I'd go about justifying it
[23-Nov-2014 00:19:21]  <Alicia> There's also possibly adding a Relationship die with Kazuki, since they tries to work together and all.
[23-Nov-2014 00:22:53]  <IllFlower> Hm. Why don't we put this on ice for a bit and revisit it with fresh minds next time?
[23-Nov-2014 00:23:07]  <Alicia> Yeah, that's a good idea. I'm tired today...
[23-Nov-2014 00:23:24]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, everyone. We'll be back soon.
