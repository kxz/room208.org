[08-Feb-2014 02:07:28]  <IllFlower> So, when we left off, I was busy trying to salvage the remnants of the previous session.
[08-Feb-2014 02:07:48]  *** Alicia is now known as Hiiragi
[08-Feb-2014 02:08:31]  <IllFlower> I mean, uh, ahem, we were trying to figure out what the hell was going on with Akiko and her boyfriend and those weird, inexplicable witch attacks. Yeah, that.
[08-Feb-2014 02:08:46]  <Rig> Yeah, Ayako asked if Chihiro was magic.
[08-Feb-2014 02:08:58]  <IllFlower> So I think the general agreement was that we'd go looking for said boyfriend.
[08-Feb-2014 02:09:10]  <Rig> Yeah.
[08-Feb-2014 02:09:12]  <ponicalica> Yeah.
[08-Feb-2014 02:10:15]  <Hiiragi> Mhm.
[08-Feb-2014 02:10:18]  <IllFlower> Are we going to inform Akiko of what's happening, or would you rather operate under radio silence?
[08-Feb-2014 02:10:20]  *** Nitya <~Glossina@gannon-wless-gw.resnet.wsu.edu> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 190 seconds)
[08-Feb-2014 02:10:29]  <ponicalica> I thought Akiko was conked out at best.
[08-Feb-2014 02:10:41]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: I won't be able to make this session
[08-Feb-2014 02:10:47]  <IllFlower> Nah, she woke up.
[08-Feb-2014 02:10:58]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: Something come up?
[08-Feb-2014 02:11:32]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: ah, so I misinterpreted "The strength seems to leave her body."?

[08-Feb-2014 02:11:53]  <IllFlower> Not *that* much strength.
[08-Feb-2014 02:12:11]  <Saladofstones> yeah 
[08-Feb-2014 02:12:51]  <IllFlower> Okay, I can roll with that.

[08-Feb-2014 02:14:14]  <ponicalica> I'm leaning towards telling her, if she didn't overhear us from wherever we made the decision.
[08-Feb-2014 02:14:39]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi, Rig?
[08-Feb-2014 02:14:50]  <Rig> I'm good with this being in the clear.
[08-Feb-2014 02:14:57]  <Hiiragi> Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
[08-Feb-2014 02:15:11]  <Hiiragi> Better than staving off the inevitable or putting on a facade.

[08-Feb-2014 02:15:55]  <IllFlower> Akiko raises some feeble protest, but considering that she's bedridden and the boyfriend is the only material lead the Conservators have, it doesn't amount to much.
[08-Feb-2014 02:15:57]  <ponicalica> Oh, and I guess we went back to Jun to get him?
[08-Feb-2014 02:16:03]  <ponicalica> er, her
[08-Feb-2014 02:16:03]  <IllFlower> Her?
[08-Feb-2014 02:16:05]  <ponicalica> it's been too long :V
[08-Feb-2014 02:16:24]  <IllFlower> So long that you forgot what pronoun to use for a magical girl?
[08-Feb-2014 02:16:33]  <IllFlower> Must've really had it taken out of you. :p
[08-Feb-2014 02:16:35]  <Rig> I imagine Jun will be released from the hospital in time for this mission.
[08-Feb-2014 02:16:41]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[08-Feb-2014 02:16:41]  <ponicalica> So long that I forgot Jun was a girl.
[08-Feb-2014 02:16:54]  <IllFlower> She's not even the manliest of the PCs, man.
[08-Feb-2014 02:16:57]  <ponicalica> Isn't "Jun" a gender neutral name anyways?
[08-Feb-2014 02:17:02]  <Rig> Jun gives Ayako a wink.
[08-Feb-2014 02:17:02]  <ponicalica> Yeah but Hitomi's gone.
[08-Feb-2014 02:17:25]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but that doesn't make Jun any happier that you got her gender mixed up.
[08-Feb-2014 02:18:05]  <IllFlower> Anyway, Jun's discharged from the hospital in short order, and the girls head off to visit this Toshi person.
[08-Feb-2014 02:18:51]  <ponicalica> Hey, at least she's not Aoi, who was referred to as a "magical girl" all the time.
[08-Feb-2014 02:19:41]  <IllFlower> The directions they manage to coax out of Akiko land them in an old high-rise apartment building that looks like it's been shoved unceremoniously into the middle of an already-crowded narrow back street.
[08-Feb-2014 02:19:55]  <Rig> "Nice place."
[08-Feb-2014 02:20:57]  <IllFlower> The concrete stairwell is a bit musty, and there are occasional graffiti tags on the walls.
[08-Feb-2014 02:21:40]  <IllFlower> The girls draw up to the door of apartment 602 and... well, that's where you guys come in.
[08-Feb-2014 02:21:52]  <Rig> (Hitomi could identify the graffiti)
[08-Feb-2014 02:22:12]  <IllFlower> ("The girls briefly reflect on their lost comrade.")
[08-Feb-2014 02:22:12]  <Rig> ("These little shits are edging in on my turf.")
[08-Feb-2014 02:22:12]  <Barcodrawing> i apologize for those who miss my presence.
[08-Feb-2014 02:22:30]  <Barcodrawing> "*baton tap*"
[08-Feb-2014 02:22:35]  <ponicalica> (Ayako's just annoyed at all the screwed-up radicals.)
[08-Feb-2014 02:22:40]  <Rig> "Do we just knock?" Jun asks.
[08-Feb-2014 02:22:52]  <IllFlower> Little do they know Hitomi left to pursue a street art history degree.
[08-Feb-2014 02:22:53]  <ponicalica> Ayako demurrs to Jun.  "I...I think you're more equipped with dealing with...people..."
[08-Feb-2014 02:23:11]  <Rig> Jun looks at her two partners.
[08-Feb-2014 02:23:16]  <Rig> "I think you're right."
[08-Feb-2014 02:23:17]  <IllFlower> Anyone up for kicking down the door? ;)
[08-Feb-2014 02:23:19]  <ponicalica> "...but yeah, I think we just knock.  Say we're friends or something.  That's what friends do, right?  Go over to people's houses?"
[08-Feb-2014 02:23:31]  <Barcodrawing> stack up on the door. two girls on overwatch
[08-Feb-2014 02:23:36]  <Rig> Jun knocks on the door.
[08-Feb-2014 02:23:40]  <ponicalica> I don't mean to write Ayako as such a sad girl but man it's kinda happening.  :V
[08-Feb-2014 02:23:57]  <IllFlower> @dice roll d7
[08-Feb-2014 02:23:57]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 4 = 4.
[08-Feb-2014 02:24:04]  <Rig> Door explodes.
[08-Feb-2014 02:24:08]  <Rig> 4 is death, right?
[08-Feb-2014 02:24:10]  <ponicalica> d7?
[08-Feb-2014 02:24:14]  <Hiiragi> "Ayako's write, it's best to leave you to talk to the others."
[08-Feb-2014 02:24:15]  <IllFlower> Thursday!
[08-Feb-2014 02:24:21]  <IllFlower> No, just kidding.
[08-Feb-2014 02:24:37]  <Barcodrawing> Rig: now i'm thinking of the one level in the first max payne where you open a door slowly and it triggers a shotgun trap.
[08-Feb-2014 02:24:52]  <Rig> Like the bit in HM.
[08-Feb-2014 02:24:58]  <Barcodrawing> mhm.
[08-Feb-2014 02:25:00]  <ponicalica> 3>"Ayako's write" lol
[08-Feb-2014 02:25:04]  <Hiiragi> ....
[08-Feb-2014 02:25:05]  <Barcodrawing> lol
[08-Feb-2014 02:25:06]  <Hiiragi> right*
[08-Feb-2014 02:25:10]  <Hiiragi> Sorry. ;_;
[08-Feb-2014 02:25:20]  <Rig> Throwing off my immersion.
[08-Feb-2014 02:25:25]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi: nah, I was loling because one of the readings of "Ayako" is "read" + the "-ko" particle, IIRC
[08-Feb-2014 02:25:38]  <Hiiragi> Heh...
[08-Feb-2014 02:26:22]  <IllFlower> After a few moments of silence, there's a "click" as the door unlocks.
[08-Feb-2014 02:26:40]  <Rig> Jun puts on her best "I didn't just get released from the hospital" face.
[08-Feb-2014 02:27:01]  <IllFlower> It opens to reveal a man in perhaps his early to mid-twenties, looking for all the world like a college student who's just been unpleasantly roused from a nap.
[08-Feb-2014 02:27:08]  <IllFlower> "Can I help you?" he asks.
[08-Feb-2014 02:27:22]  <Rig> (Briefly considers that this might be the guy)
[08-Feb-2014 02:27:37]  <ponicalica> Ayako whispers to Hikari.  "Older brother?"  (it's totally Toshi himself)
[08-Feb-2014 02:27:47]  <Rig> "We were looking for Toshi. We're friends of his."
[08-Feb-2014 02:27:56]  <Rig> Jun gives a sweet smile.
[08-Feb-2014 02:28:07]  <IllFlower> The man'
[08-Feb-2014 02:28:08]  <Rig> (Roll for deception)
[08-Feb-2014 02:29:04]  * Hiiragi mutters back quickly "I doubt it, but if not, then we deal."
[08-Feb-2014 02:29:27]  <IllFlower> ... man's expression sours somewhat. "That's me." He leaves the "and you're a filthy liar" implied.
[08-Feb-2014 02:30:25]  <Rig> Jun doesn't lose the smile. "Aren't you kind of old to be dating a high schooler?"
[08-Feb-2014 02:33:35]  <Rig> IllFlower: Hope I'm not ruining your plans.
[08-Feb-2014 02:33:37]  <IllFlower> "You must be acquaintances of Aki's, then."
[08-Feb-2014 02:34:25]  <ponicalica> "Yeah.  She's in the hospital."
[08-Feb-2014 02:35:14]  <Rig> Suddenly the end of the last session makes some sense.
[08-Feb-2014 02:36:06]  <ponicalica> Yeah.  I kind of figured when IllFlower brought in a 20+-year-old dude that it'd be Toshi after how they shied from describing him
[08-Feb-2014 02:37:11]  <IllFlower> "Yes, I'm aware of that. Has her condition changed at all?"
[08-Feb-2014 02:37:37]  <IllFlower> If Toshi's annoyed, he's certainly not being too obvious about it.
[08-Feb-2014 02:38:43]  <Rig> "We were talking to her the other day actually." Jun says. "She said she was attacked on her way over here. We were concerned and wanted to know if you'd seen anything."
[08-Feb-2014 02:40:25]  <IllFlower> "I don't really know what happened. I'm sorry. I can tell you what I know about Aki, but I imagine my doorway isn't the best place to do it.
[08-Feb-2014 02:40:38]  <ponicalica> "Do you know any better places?"
[08-Feb-2014 02:41:02]  <IllFlower> "Would you like to come i--" Toshi thinks for a second. "Um, we can go to a fast food place or something, if that's not too much trouble."
[08-Feb-2014 02:41:08]  <Barcodrawing> snerk.
[08-Feb-2014 02:41:47]  <Hiiragi> "Anywhere is fine, really, it *is* better than just standing here."
[08-Feb-2014 02:41:52]  <IllFlower> Autopilot cordiality can get you in trouble!
[08-Feb-2014 02:42:16]  <ponicalica> Toshi's house: turns out to be full of dead bodies
[08-Feb-2014 02:43:29]  *** MobileAvenue <~CentralAv@cpe-65-24-227-116.insight.res.rr.com> has joined #madokamadness
[08-Feb-2014 02:43:32]  <IllFlower> It's more of inviting three teenage girls into your apartment being, uh, awkward.
[08-Feb-2014 02:44:07]  <ponicalica> well he's already dating one :p
[08-Feb-2014 02:44:27]  <Rig> Jun's mind ticks for a moment, invisible under her smile. She doesn't know this area. Toshi is seriously suspect. However, already getting caught in a lie doesn't put her in a great spot. "Yeah, sure. Wouldn't want to see too many young girls coming and going from your apartment, right? Neighbors might get the wrong idea."
[08-Feb-2014 02:44:52]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: No reason to make it more so, certainly.
[08-Feb-2014 02:46:39]  <IllFlower> Rig: "I appreciate your concern, but I'm hardly the most 'interesting' person in this building.
[08-Feb-2014 02:46:59]  <IllFlower> "Anyway, shall we go? There's not a few places out on the main road."
[08-Feb-2014 02:47:37]  <Rig> "Lead the way."
[08-Feb-2014 02:48:13]  <IllFlower> Ways are led.
[08-Feb-2014 02:49:31]  <Hiiragi> "Yes, after you." Hikari smiles, making room for him to pass."
[08-Feb-2014 02:49:39]  <Hiiragi> (No ."*)
[08-Feb-2014 02:49:49]  <ponicalica> Ayako follows behind Hikari, Jun, and Toshi.
[08-Feb-2014 02:49:59]  <IllFlower> "My name's actually Toshihide, in full," the man says as the four of them walk down the alley. "Toshihide Miura. You can call me by either name. 'Toshi' is a bit too familiar for me, though."
[08-Feb-2014 02:51:03]  <IllFlower> True to his word, there's a fast food joint at a nearby intersection. It's not totally packed, being the middle of the afternoon, but still got a fair number of customers.
[08-Feb-2014 02:51:34]  <Rig> (Read it as Toshihilde and laughed)
[08-Feb-2014 02:51:40]  <Barcodrawing> hee.
[08-Feb-2014 02:52:22]  <IllFlower> "If you three want to order something, that's fine."
[08-Feb-2014 02:54:07]  <Hiiragi> "That's all well and good then, Miura. I'm Hiiragi, pleased to make your acquaintance." Hikari glances at the menu, seeing little of value. "Anyway, if I might begin, what do you know about Aki?"
[08-Feb-2014 02:54:58]  <IllFlower> (His name's actually Brunhilde, obviously.)
[08-Feb-2014 02:55:00]  <Rig> Jun raises an eyebrow. Asking her boyfriend that might get some answers she doesn't want.
[08-Feb-2014 02:55:33]  <ponicalica> Ayako orders a side dish and munches on them while Hikari and Toshihide talk.
[08-Feb-2014 02:55:52]  <Hiiragi> (He said he'd say what he knows...)
[08-Feb-2014 02:56:42]  <IllFlower> Toshihide sets down a cup of coffee on the table. "Can I ask you something first? I'm afraid I still don't really understand who you are, or what you're looking for."
[08-Feb-2014 02:57:37]  <Rig> "We're just concerned about Aki and don't really know what happened to her."
[08-Feb-2014 02:57:57]  <Rig> "She told us she remembers coming over to see you last," Jun says.
[08-Feb-2014 02:58:39]  <IllFlower> "So you've been to see her?"
[08-Feb-2014 02:59:00]  <ponicalica> Ayako stays mostly quiet.  Dealing with non-magical people is really not her area of expertise.
[08-Feb-2014 02:59:25]  <ponicalica> "Yeah.  We talked to her basically right after she woke up."
[08-Feb-2014 03:01:47]  <IllFlower> "To be honest, that probably means you know more than I do. I've only been kept up to date on this by another friend of hers. Our relationship isn't exactly the kind where I'd get notified about her showing up in the hospital, you see.
[08-Feb-2014 03:02:12]  <IllFlower> "For all I knew that night, she'd just vanished without explanation.
[08-Feb-2014 03:02:28]  <IllFlower> "I'm still not really sure why you're asking me this. Surely you'd be better off asking Aki herself?"

[08-Feb-2014 03:02:53]  <Rig> "She wasn't really forthcoming about any of this."
[08-Feb-2014 03:03:40]  <Rig> "I imagine you'd understand her wanting to keep a relationship with an /older/ guy under wraps."
[08-Feb-2014 03:04:02]  <IllFlower> "I see. So you want to know about the two of us."
[08-Feb-2014 03:04:18]  <Rig> "It'd be nice to know that she's not being manipulated, yes."
[08-Feb-2014 03:04:30]  <Rig> (Roll for Social Link Backlash)
[08-Feb-2014 03:04:37]  <IllFlower> "You suspect me somehow?"
[08-Feb-2014 03:05:06]  <ponicalica> "Well, the sort of thing that's happened to her doesn't exactly happen without some ill will involved.  Right now, you're the only connection we have."
[08-Feb-2014 03:06:28]  <IllFlower> Toshihide takes a long breath, ruffling his lopsided hair.
[08-Feb-2014 03:07:30]  <IllFlower> "Well, I've already told you everything I know about the night she was attacked. Everything else I can give you is just context."
[08-Feb-2014 03:07:30]  <Hiiragi> "And she may be awake, now, but she's still pretty worse for wear. It wasn't easy to talk with her."

[08-Feb-2014 03:09:45]  <ponicalica> I think it might even be time to initiate a conflict, though there's still the problem that everyone's still talking around Akiko's magic, lol
[08-Feb-2014 03:09:53]  <IllFlower> You might want to prompt for specific context.
[08-Feb-2014 03:10:21]  <ponicalica> "Is there anyone who would have had it out for Akiko?"
[08-Feb-2014 03:10:27]  <Rig> Maybe a bit too blunt.
[08-Feb-2014 03:10:31]  <IllFlower> I don't think there's space for a conflict. I have no idea what the stakes would be.

[08-Feb-2014 03:19:07]  <IllFlower> "I could imagine that arousing some jealousy. Is that enough to merit her getting attacked on the street? Not in my mind, but that's all I can think of."

[08-Feb-2014 03:21:50]  <IllFlower> "She doesn't talk about it. I always assumed that maybe her family was well off, but that there were some strained relations going on."

[08-Feb-2014 03:32:01]  <Rig> Jun nods a little. "Does she come by your place a lot?"
[08-Feb-2014 03:32:45]  <IllFlower> "Once every couple of days. It's harder for me to go see her, for obvious reasons."
[08-Feb-2014 03:33:01]  <Rig> "Does her family know?"
[08-Feb-2014 03:33:46]  <IllFlower> "Considering the way she acts when the subject of her family comes up in any other context, I assume not."
[08-Feb-2014 03:36:33]  <ponicalica> "How does she act?"

[08-Feb-2014 03:39:07]  <IllFlower> "Brushes it off, mostly. On the couple of occasions where I've pressed her about it, she gets angry. It's not really worth arguing over, so I just let it drop."
[08-Feb-2014 03:41:11]  <Rig> "She does like to have her secrets."
[08-Feb-2014 03:41:40]  <IllFlower> It's hard to be a magical girl if you don't.
[08-Feb-2014 03:41:53]  <Rig> Jun doubts that they'll get anything useful from pressing Toshi. She's tired to sitting around. She did plenty of that in the hospital.
[08-Feb-2014 03:42:03]  <Rig> "Sorry we barged in on you and started asking questions."
[08-Feb-2014 03:42:17]  <Rig> Jun moves to leave the table, hoping the other girls will take the hint.
[08-Feb-2014 03:43:19]  <IllFlower> "No, that's fine. I hope it helped, anonymous stranger."
[08-Feb-2014 03:43:34]  <Rig> "Right," Jun pauses.
[08-Feb-2014 03:43:40]  <Barcodrawing> ((we're star fox!))
[08-Feb-2014 03:43:51]  <ponicalica> At least it's not "Anonymous Coward".
[08-Feb-2014 03:44:01]  <IllFlower> This is the part where they do their magical girl team poses.
[08-Feb-2014 03:44:58]  <Rig> "I'm Wakahisa Hitomi," Jun says with a slight smile. "We'll let Aki know you were concerned about her."
[08-Feb-2014 03:45:05]  <Barcodrawing> ((nice))
[08-Feb-2014 03:46:58]  <IllFlower> "Of course." Toshihide returns the smile. "If you need anything else, you know where to find me."
[08-Feb-2014 03:48:47]  <Hiiragi> "Thanks, we'll be sure to keep that in mind." Hikari replies, rising.
[08-Feb-2014 03:49:01]  <Hiiragi> (I can barely function.)
[08-Feb-2014 03:49:09]  <ponicalica> "Thank you for talking to us."  Ayako walks up.
[08-Feb-2014 03:49:14]  <ponicalica> er, away, whatever
[08-Feb-2014 03:49:15]  <Barcodrawing> Hiiragi: coffee of no help?
[08-Feb-2014 03:49:17]  <ponicalica> with the other girls
[08-Feb-2014 03:49:31]  <Barcodrawing> ayako starts walking, her walking animation cycling but herself rising directly upwards.
[08-Feb-2014 03:49:39]  <Rig> Jun leads the team out of the eatery and down the street for a while, trying to make idle chitchat with her group. Eventually she feels they've put enough distance between themselves and Toshi.
[08-Feb-2014 03:49:47]  <Hiiragi> Barcodrawing: Tea has little effect, right now.
[08-Feb-2014 03:49:54]  <Barcodrawing> tea's not strong enough >_<
[08-Feb-2014 03:50:00]  <Rig> "Everyone involved in this is hiding something, it seems."
[08-Feb-2014 03:50:15]  <IllFlower> "An automatic restart of Piratepad will occur in -1544 seconds." /sigh
[08-Feb-2014 03:50:41]  <Rig> "How about we keep an eye on Toshihide for a while and see if that leads us anywhere?"
[08-Feb-2014 03:52:01]  <Hiiragi> "Sounds like a good plan to me, though what do you have in mind for watching him? He already seems pretty suspicious of us."
[08-Feb-2014 03:53:00]  <Hiiragi> (Barcodrawing: Yeah, but coffee isn't going to help too much either, I don't think. ;/ Especially afterwards.)
[08-Feb-2014 03:53:01]  <IllFlower> Before the conversation can go much farther, there's a sudden *crack*, and Shii the familiar appears before the girls in a bolt of light.
[08-Feb-2014 03:53:15]  <Barcodrawing> jesus, i read that as a "bone crack sound effect" crack
[08-Feb-2014 03:53:42]  <IllFlower> Her expression seems rather agitated.
[08-Feb-2014 03:54:41]  <IllFlower> "Jun, Hikari, Ayako," she says, addressing the three girls in order.
[08-Feb-2014 03:55:22]  <ponicalica> "Yes, Shii?", Ayako switches into a possibly excessively deferential register.
[08-Feb-2014 03:56:21]  <Hiiragi> "Hello again, Shii." Hikari responds cordially. "Is something wrong?
[08-Feb-2014 03:56:23]  <Hiiragi> "
[08-Feb-2014 03:56:50]  <IllFlower> Haha, oh boy.
[08-Feb-2014 03:57:12]  <Barcodrawing> i'm imagining hiiragi doing that kind of hands-behind-the-back, leaning forward, one foot in the air pose
[08-Feb-2014 03:57:16]  <Barcodrawing> lookin' down at the megukal rat
[08-Feb-2014 03:57:25]  <Barcodrawing> one foot in the air forward*
[08-Feb-2014 03:57:44]  <IllFlower> Barcodrawing: That seems more like an "aw, shucks, you think I'm cute?" pose.
[08-Feb-2014 03:58:14]  <Barcodrawing> IllFlower: that sorta mildly mischievous pose :P
[08-Feb-2014 03:59:03]  <Hiiragi> Barcodrawing: Close, but only without any feet in the air. :p

[08-Feb-2014 04:01:09]  <Rig> ((How far are we from the western wards?))
[08-Feb-2014 04:01:21]  <IllFlower> Why do you ask?
[08-Feb-2014 04:01:34]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi: isn't Sanae a touhou
[08-Feb-2014 04:02:04]  <Hiiragi> Yes.
[08-Feb-2014 04:02:13]  <Hiiragi> Kochiya.
[08-Feb-2014 04:02:18]  <IllFlower> Goddammit, of course.
[08-Feb-2014 04:02:21]  <Rig> Just curious about like how local it is.
[08-Feb-2014 04:03:57]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi: isn't she one of teh shrine maidens
[08-Feb-2014 04:04:26]  <IllFlower> Rig: It'd take a subway ride to get there.

[08-Feb-2014 04:05:53]  <Hiiragi> "I take it you want us to hurry over there, Shii. What else should we know?"
[08-Feb-2014 04:06:02]  <Hiiragi> ( :((( )
[08-Feb-2014 04:06:02]  <ponicalica> personally though I liked when he chose Asahina for Kaede thinking "Haruhi's over" and I was just thinking "lol Dangan Ronpa"
[08-Feb-2014 04:06:16]  <IllFlower> I would slide "ponicalica" into the On Notice board, but it's already there.
[08-Feb-2014 04:06:23]  <ponicalica> Rig: *touhou death bwong*
[08-Feb-2014 04:06:32]  <Hiiragi> (Asahina is also an anime from Haruhi Suzumiya, so heh.)

[08-Feb-2014 04:06:56]  <IllFlower> It was going to be something else before AKB48 messed everything up.
[08-Feb-2014 04:07:00]  <IllFlower> Like they tend to do.
[08-Feb-2014 04:07:02]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[08-Feb-2014 04:08:14]  <IllFlower> "She wasn't found all that long ago. The elders have been trying to piece things together, but they need boots on the ground, and you were the closest.
[08-Feb-2014 04:08:37]  <IllFlower> "We're rounding up the necessary information. You'll have it when you need it."
[08-Feb-2014 04:08:52]  <IllFlower> (In other words, ask me to fill it in and I'll give it to you.)
[08-Feb-2014 04:10:01]  <ponicalica> "What was the last known contact Sanae had, in particular with other initiates?" (I assume we wouldn't be talking about this if Sanae weren't an initiate?)
[08-Feb-2014 04:10:02]  <Rig> Jun checks the clock on her phone. "Yeah, I've got time before mom wants me to check in."
[08-Feb-2014 04:13:52]  <Hiiragi> "Do we know what brought her there?"
[08-Feb-2014 04:14:27]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: The main male lead in From the New World is also named Asahina. I thought it was safe!
[08-Feb-2014 04:14:32]  <IllFlower> But nooooo.
[08-Feb-2014 04:15:21]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: "She was at a meeting with her familiar yesterday."
[08-Feb-2014 04:16:00]  <IllFlower> Hiiragi: "As for that, she apparently lives in the neighborhood. She was probably just out for a walk."
[08-Feb-2014 04:16:56]  <Rig> "Was she involved in any other fights recently?"
[08-Feb-2014 04:19:11]  <IllFlower> "No, not at all. She seemed to be getting along quite well."
[08-Feb-2014 04:20:29]  <IllFlower> Unless you mean with witches, in which case, you know, occupational hazard, all that jazz.
[08-Feb-2014 04:20:42]  <Rig> right.
[08-Feb-2014 04:21:15]  <ponicalica> "Has there been an increase in witch attacks in the area recently?"
[08-Feb-2014 04:22:38]  <IllFlower> Oh, there was something I meant to say. Let's sneak that in there...
[08-Feb-2014 04:24:27]  <IllFlower> "There has been an upswing in witch attacks recently, but this is the first one that's been fatal in at least a few months.
[08-Feb-2014 04:26:28]  <IllFlower> "This isn't good. Especially with all the shuffling that's been going on lately."
[08-Feb-2014 04:28:44]  <ponicalica> "Hmm.  We don't seem to have much in the way of leads for Sanae, and with Akiko all we got out of Toshihide was that she was possibly using her magical powers to get money, but even that's tenuous..."
[08-Feb-2014 04:30:40]  <IllFlower> Not a terrible first guess.
[08-Feb-2014 04:31:03]  <ponicalica> ("Really, what we need is a detective.")
[08-Feb-2014 04:31:16]  <Rig> Magical Girl Dark Knight.
[08-Feb-2014 04:31:23]  <IllFlower> Someone might want to ask about the shuffling.
[08-Feb-2014 04:31:30]  <IllFlower> Hint, hint.
[08-Feb-2014 04:31:39]  <Rig> "Shuffling? I thought our team was the only one getting moved around."
[08-Feb-2014 04:34:08]  <IllFlower> "No. There have been a lot of initiates changing hands. I'm not privy to why, since it's officially not my concern, but if I had to hazard a first guess I'd say there are... disciplinary problems.
[08-Feb-2014 04:34:30]  <IllFlower> "In the worst case, there might be a low-level civil war.
[08-Feb-2014 04:34:48]  <IllFlower> "Anyway, now that another initiate has died, it's suddenly become our business."
[08-Feb-2014 04:35:04]  <ponicalica> "Disciplinary problems?"
[08-Feb-2014 04:35:07]  <ponicalica> ("Metal Gear?")
[08-Feb-2014 04:35:36]  <Rig> "Right, a low-level civil war. Nobody panic," Jun says, glaring at Shii's marshmallow-y face.
[08-Feb-2014 04:36:09]  <IllFlower> Hey, man, don't judge a familiar by its cover.
[08-Feb-2014 04:36:15]  <Rig> "Can you fill us in on the way over there? I'm sure we can find a deserted train car."

[08-Feb-2014 04:45:15]  <IllFlower> Nope.
[08-Feb-2014 04:45:33]  <IllFlower> She was fairly ordinary, by all accounts.
[08-Feb-2014 04:46:13]  <IllFlower> I'm going to answer these questions OOC because they're actually being answered in a dossier or something.
[08-Feb-2014 04:47:04]  <Hiiragi> "Did any other Conservators watch the area that we can talk to? And might the witch be trying to draw out someone else, with Sanae as bait?"
[08-Feb-2014 04:47:34]  <ponicalica> Now I'm imagining, like, a magical dossier answering things Siri-style.
[08-Feb-2014 04:48:14]  <ponicalica> Google's "secret sauce" algorithms: actually a magical girl familiar after all.
[08-Feb-2014 04:48:21]  <IllFlower> Well, it's presumably a combination of existing knowledge, stuff from the grapevine, and direct information.
[08-Feb-2014 04:49:26]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi: I think Shii actually mentioned that we're the closest Conservators to the crime scene
[08-Feb-2014 04:49:39]  <ponicalica> Were Akiko or Chihiro initiates who changed hands?
[08-Feb-2014 04:49:49]  <Rig> A girl all alone at a shrine gets attacked.
[08-Feb-2014 04:49:55]  <Rig> Certainly symbolic.
[08-Feb-2014 04:50:04]  <Rig> Also, lots of magic girls under attack it seems.
[08-Feb-2014 04:50:27]  <Rig> I wonder if there is any information about how the witch manifested.
[08-Feb-2014 04:50:37]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: No, and no. Akiko is probably the closest to the whole mess, but that's not immediately relevant.
[08-Feb-2014 04:51:43]  <ponicalica> Did Sanae have any connection to the shrine or was she just passing by? ("she's actually the maiden of a different shrine in a different fictional universe")
[08-Feb-2014 04:52:11]  <IllFlower> Rig: Sanae is probably the only one who could have known, unfortunately.
[08-Feb-2014 04:52:36]  <Rig> Excellent.
[08-Feb-2014 04:52:41]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Just passing by. Divorce your mind from Touhou!
[08-Feb-2014 04:52:41]  <Rig> We can do necromancy.
[08-Feb-2014 04:52:53]  <IllFlower> I don't think that's within the girls' purview.

[08-Feb-2014 05:03:55]  <IllFlower> Of course you'll be able to. I'm not arbitrarily evil.
[08-Feb-2014 05:03:57]  <Barcodrawing> well, case closed, nothing you guys can do about it. time to move to the next town.
[08-Feb-2014 05:04:14]  <Rig> Rock falls.
[08-Feb-2014 05:04:31]  <IllFlower> Oh, I should mention, she was Jun's age, so she had classmates.
[08-Feb-2014 05:04:41]  <Hiiragi> "What do the other familiars think of this? Sanae's familiar, in particular, given that she was talking to them last."
[08-Feb-2014 05:04:44]  <IllFlower> "Rockets Fall on Rocket Falls"
[08-Feb-2014 05:05:11]  <IllFlower> Hiiragi: Approximately "holy shit wtf why".
[08-Feb-2014 05:05:15]  <Rig> 30 minute interlude for postrock.
[08-Feb-2014 05:05:35]  <IllFlower> I've been listening to the Halo soundtrack, so.
[08-Feb-2014 05:05:43]  <Hiiragi> Why does no one know anything, darn it. Do we need to punch someone or something to get answers?
[08-Feb-2014 05:05:44]  <ponicalica> Have any of her classmates been acting strangely recently?  In particluarly those close to her?
[08-Feb-2014 05:06:14]  <IllFlower> I think at that point you'd actually have to talk to one of them.
[08-Feb-2014 05:06:27]  <IllFlower> She had a best friend, that'll be a good starting point.
[08-Feb-2014 05:06:42]  <Rig> Do police show up when an emgirl dies?
[08-Feb-2014 05:07:33]  <IllFlower> No. Witches have a way of making induced deaths look like suicides.
[08-Feb-2014 05:07:41]  <Rig> Ah
[08-Feb-2014 05:07:45]  <Rig> makes sense.
[08-Feb-2014 05:07:53]  <ponicalica> When they don't make them look like missing person cases?
[08-Feb-2014 05:07:59]  <Hiiragi> We probably shouldn't try to talk with Sanae's friend like we did with Toshihide. Though I doubt *she* is keen on talking, too.
[08-Feb-2014 05:08:09]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Pretty much.
[08-Feb-2014 05:09:30]  <Hiiragi> And hopefully we could pick up someone with sleuthing skills along the way.
[08-Feb-2014 05:09:33]  <IllFlower> I'm up for doing whatever when you guys are ready.
[08-Feb-2014 05:09:45]  <ponicalica> I think I'm ready.
[08-Feb-2014 05:10:02]  <ponicalica> But I thought you were about to end the session since you said "We're close to hitting time" :V
[08-Feb-2014 05:10:38]  <IllFlower> We're actually past time, but I don't have to go anywhere.
[08-Feb-2014 05:11:08]  <IllFlower> I'm willing to go until we either call time or I slump over unconscious on my desk.
[08-Feb-2014 05:11:11]  <ponicalica> But yeah, if Hiiragi and Rig are ready, I'm ready.
[08-Feb-2014 05:11:43]  <Hiiragi> I say it's time we hit the crime scene. Or check on her friend.
[08-Feb-2014 05:11:53]  <Rig> I'd kind of like to call it to be honest. I'm sniffling and surrounded by tissue boxes and would like to finish this alkaseltzer and get to bed.
[08-Feb-2014 05:12:26]  <Hiiragi> (I know that. >.>_
[08-Feb-2014 05:12:27]  <Hiiragi> )*
[08-Feb-2014 05:12:40]  <ponicalica> sorry if I was overly oblivious :V
[08-Feb-2014 05:12:41]  <Hiiragi> I'm fine for next time too.
[08-Feb-2014 05:12:44]  <Rig> We can continue tomorrow night or Sunday.
[08-Feb-2014 05:12:54]  <Rig> If we want to do more this weekend.
[08-Feb-2014 05:13:04]  <Rig> (Than anyone has ever been as far as to look like.)
[08-Feb-2014 05:13:20]  <ponicalica> Yeah, I'm fine with continuing tomorrow.
[08-Feb-2014 05:13:30]  <Hiiragi> What time? Curious.
[08-Feb-2014 05:13:42]  <Rig> 9pm EST?
[08-Feb-2014 05:13:47]  <IllFlower> Maybe a little earlier.
[08-Feb-2014 05:13:49]  <Rig> Sure.
[08-Feb-2014 05:13:50]  <IllFlower> 7 or so.
[08-Feb-2014 05:13:53]  <Rig> Yeah.

[08-Feb-2014 05:14:14]  <IllFlower> Yeah, 7/4.
[08-Feb-2014 05:14:23]  <Rig> Is that good with everyone?
[08-Feb-2014 05:14:24]  <IllFlower> 6 for Alicia, I guess.
[08-Feb-2014 05:14:27]  <Rig> Sorry for killing the session.
[08-Feb-2014 05:14:31]  <IllFlower> Or 5? I can't remember.
[08-Feb-2014 05:14:38]  <IllFlower> >time zones
[08-Feb-2014 05:15:01]  <Hiiragi> I'm two hours ahead of ponny.
[08-Feb-2014 05:15:05]  <IllFlower> Rig: Nah, it's cool, magical girls aren't worth destroying your health.
[08-Feb-2014 05:15:07]  <ponicalica> She's CT, so 6.
[08-Feb-2014 05:15:15]  <Hiiragi> Yeah, 6.
[08-Feb-2014 05:15:26]  <ponicalica> (Central Time mind you, not Connecticut.)
[08-Feb-2014 05:15:27]  <Rig> Tomorrow at 7/6/4pm.

[08-Feb-2014 05:15:39]  <ponicalica> "magical girls aren't worth destroying your health" you sure?
[08-Feb-2014 05:15:45]  <IllFlower> Done.
[08-Feb-2014 05:15:53]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, everyone.
[08-Feb-2014 05:15:54]  *** Hiiragi is now known as Alicia
[08-Feb-2014 05:16:01]  <ponicalica> Though it's being a magical girl that'll destroy you in general
[08-Feb-2014 05:16:02]  <Alicia> Sorry for the lackluster play.
[08-Feb-2014 05:16:07]  <Rig> All right. So, we'll get off the subway and interrogate some witches tomorrow.
[08-Feb-2014 05:16:11]  <IllFlower> One of these days we'll get to those shooty-gun conflicts.
