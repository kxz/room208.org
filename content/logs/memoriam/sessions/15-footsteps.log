@time=2014-03-22T01:39:20.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :did you take fallout?
@time=2014-03-22T01:39:24.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :didn't you fold?
@time=2014-03-22T01:39:44.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, but I thought we both had to. >_>;
@time=2014-03-22T01:39:48.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Never mind.
@time=2014-03-22T01:40:36.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :you only take fallout when you take the blow
@time=2014-03-22T01:40:48.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think the demonic influence also took fallout, can't remember how that works
@time=2014-03-22T01:41:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It doesn't really.
@time=2014-03-22T01:41:13.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ah.

@time=2014-03-22T01:41:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I guess you can hold on to a 5 for later.
@time=2014-03-22T01:42:10.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so let's see, uh, 9, what does 9 mean again?
@time=2014-03-22T01:42:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Single long-term fallout item
@time=2014-03-22T01:43:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :At this point Ayako basically dispels the charm in as dramatic a fashion as you see fit.

@time=2014-03-22T01:46:36.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako pulls out her wand again.  With the final line "CONVENI LUX!" she aims at a point in the distance and with a flash of light the darkness shatters.
@time=2014-03-22T01:47:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just a moment.
@time=2014-03-22T01:54:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The room reasserts its usual form around the two girls.
@time=2014-03-22T01:55:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari falls to the ground as if she'd been suspended unconscious in the air. She coughs, then draws in a sharp breath as she realizes everything has returned to normal.
@time=2014-03-22T01:56:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako, despite being in some discomfort of her own, rushes over to check on Hikari.
@time=2014-03-22T02:00:22.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hikari, are you okay?"
@time=2014-03-22T02:02:04.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari struggles onto her knees, slowly breathing in and out. "I'm... fine, Ayako. I'm fine. Thank you."
@time=2014-03-22T02:02:32.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari stands up, looking around. "But I'm not even sure what to say about *that*."
@time=2014-03-22T02:02:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let me borrow that for a second.
@time=2014-03-22T02:03:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hm?
@time=2014-03-22T02:03:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari points at a sparkling mass of tendril-like paths running from the center of the spell circle that Ayako crafted, before Emi's counter-charm kicked in.
@time=2014-03-22T02:05:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The vines soon resolve themselves into what appears to be... a very complicated tangle of footprints, with names on top of each of the tracks.
@time=2014-03-22T02:05:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako immediately recognizes some of the names. Emi's, of course, and presumably those of her parents - but also Akiko's, Sanae's, and, most tellingly, Satsuki's...
@time=2014-03-22T02:08:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :This must be why Emi set up the counter-charm. Anyone who knew the right incantation would be able to trivially trace her whereabouts otherwise.
@time=2014-03-22T02:11:59.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hmm.  Looks like this would allow us to trace both Emi and Satsuki."
@time=2014-03-22T02:14:18.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I guess the question is, who should we track down first?"
@time=2014-03-22T02:14:57.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Sounds like we found what we needed. Emi, perhaps?"
@time=2014-03-22T02:16:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not Satsuki?
@time=2014-03-22T02:17:50.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hmm, maybe, but what would we do?  It's hard to tell from one initiate's words but I don't think Emi's hands are entirely clean either.  But who's more dangerous, her or Satsuki?"
@time=2014-03-22T02:18:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, we can go by the number of dead people they're each responsible for...
@time=2014-03-22T02:19:27.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"...probably Satsuki."
@time=2014-03-22T02:19:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You could justify going after Emi if you wanted to be ruthlessly pragmatic about it.
@time=2014-03-22T02:19:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's killing two birds with one stone!
@time=2014-03-22T02:19:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Probably not the most morally justifiable thing to do, but hey, you are the law.
@time=2014-03-22T02:20:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not like anyone's going to call you on it if you get the job done.
@time=2014-03-22T02:23:19.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I have no issue with going after Emi.
@time=2014-03-22T02:23:28.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :.... well, that is "if you get the job done." >_>;
@time=2014-03-22T02:23:32.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hm.
@time=2014-03-22T02:25:12.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Though neither is a cakewalk, really.
@time=2014-03-22T02:25:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Although that is kinda operating under the assumption that Satsuki's faction just tosses their hands up in the air, goes "oh, looks like she's dead," and renounce their violent ways.
@time=2014-03-22T02:26:06.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, lol, yeah right.
@time=2014-03-22T02:26:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mean, there's no reason not to believe that's the case.
@time=2014-03-22T02:27:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thought there's no reason to believe that it *is*.

@time=2014-03-22T02:29:45.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: I'm... fine either way.
@time=2014-03-22T02:29:55.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think it might be better to go after Satsuki.
@time=2014-03-22T02:30:00.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Either way, I think we're about at closing time.
@time=2014-03-22T02:30:06.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mhm.
@time=2014-03-22T02:30:47.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Satsuki it is. One way or the other things are heating up. ... more. Whatever.
@time=2014-03-22T02:31:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha.
@time=2014-03-22T02:32:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, then let's close here. We'll follow Satsuki's trail next time.
@time=2014-03-22T02:32:11.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm no wordsmith okay. ;_;
@time=2014-03-22T02:32:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for playing, both of you.
