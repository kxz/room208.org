[05-Oct-2014 19:06:52]  <Leesh> :p
[05-Oct-2014 19:07:14]  <ponicalica> let's get it started in here, let's get it started in ha, etc.
[05-Oct-2014 19:08:01]  *** Fiora <~Fiora@ec2-50-17-93-47.compute-1.amazonaws.com> has left #madokamadness
[05-Oct-2014 19:08:27]  <IllFlower> It's a damp, gloomy October day. The remnants of the latest typhoon are just clearing out of Kikugawa, and the sound of sloshing punctuates every step on the city's mass of concrete sidewalks.
[05-Oct-2014 19:10:10]  <IllFlower> Shii is holding a meeting on the roof today, based on whatever perverse reasoning inclines familiars to only meet outside when the weather is suboptimal.
[05-Oct-2014 19:11:29]  <ponicalica> Rin and Kazuki are probably both fucking pissed at Shii
[05-Oct-2014 19:11:46]  <Rig> Kazuki is always pissed at Shii.
[05-Oct-2014 19:12:10]  <ponicalica> true
[05-Oct-2014 19:12:11]  <IllFlower> Sitting on top of a still-wet table, she taps away at a tablet next to her.
[05-Oct-2014 19:12:14]  <ponicalica> I mean even more pissed
[05-Oct-2014 19:12:26]  <Leesh> Hikari brought an umbrella in case of emergencies like this.
[05-Oct-2014 19:12:41]  <IllFlower> "I was forwarded this video earlier today," she says. "I'll let you draw your own judgments."
[05-Oct-2014 19:14:11]  <IllFlower> The tinny sound of the tablet's speakers is hard to make out above the din of the streets below, but it's clear from the images alone what's going on - a man being brutally beaten by a teenager outside a restaurant near the north side of town.
[05-Oct-2014 19:14:34]  <Rig> Flashbacks ensue.
[05-Oct-2014 19:15:21]  <IllFlower> "It looks like this young man and the accomplice recording the video left without paying," Shii explains. "Their victim tried to chase after them, and this was the result.
[05-Oct-2014 19:15:51]  <IllFlower> "Seems this video has turned into something of a minor spectacle online, I should add."
[05-Oct-2014 19:16:10]  <IllFlower> Indeed, the view counter has already run up into the low six digits.
[05-Oct-2014 19:17:06]  <Rig> "What does this have to do with us?"
[05-Oct-2014 19:17:38]  <IllFlower> "You might be asking why I'm showing this to you. Turns out there may be a connection to someone you're familiar with." Shii, ending her sentence on an ambiguous note, looks at Ayako and Hikari.
[05-Oct-2014 19:18:07]  <IllFlower> "Do you remember a boy named Yukihiro Karasuma?"
[05-Oct-2014 19:18:23]  <ponicalica> "Kara...suma...he was with Satuski, wasn't he?"
[05-Oct-2014 19:19:23]  <IllFlower> "As good a memory as always, Ayako. Yes, that's the one.
[05-Oct-2014 19:19:39]  <ponicalica> i didn't even have to check the character sheet this time
[05-Oct-2014 19:19:52]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@108-204-104-234.lightspeed.cicril.sbcglobal.net> has joined #madokamadness
[05-Oct-2014 19:20:26]  <IllFlower> "He had his powers stripped for six months after you took him in.
[05-Oct-2014 19:20:55]  <IllFlower> "That was in late March, so as you've probably figured, he was reinstated not too long ago."
[05-Oct-2014 19:21:32]  <IllFlower> Shii pauses for a moment.
[05-Oct-2014 19:22:46]  <ponicalica> long moment :p
[05-Oct-2014 19:23:26]  <Rig> We could fill in the silence. :P
[05-Oct-2014 19:23:59]  <IllFlower> "Coincidentally, or perhaps not, his group has been having some issues lately.
[05-Oct-2014 19:24:18]  <IllFlower> "One initiate requested a transfer, another quit entirely.
[05-Oct-2014 19:24:46]  <IllFlower> "And there's been a corresponding upswing in civilian violence, as you can see.
[05-Oct-2014 19:25:24]  <IllFlower> "Now, the evidence is entirely circumstantial, which means that all of this is out of the hands of Karasuma's familiar. She asked the Conservators to intervene."
[05-Oct-2014 19:26:54]  <IllFlower> Shii looks aside for a moment. "As you have, of course, somewhat more freedom to act."
[05-Oct-2014 19:27:02]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at the tablet again, still looping the video. The beating doesn't look magical, which is good, he supposes.
[05-Oct-2014 19:27:08]  <Leesh> Hikari grimaces at the video, then turns back. "Shii, where were they last seen?"
[05-Oct-2014 19:27:16]  <ponicalica> more freedom to throw Karasuma through a window
[05-Oct-2014 19:28:12]  <IllFlower> Leesh: Who's "they"?
[05-Oct-2014 19:28:28]  <Leesh> Sorry, meant he.
[05-Oct-2014 19:28:44]  <ponicalica> Karasuma, you mean?
[05-Oct-2014 19:28:58]  <Leesh> Yes.
[05-Oct-2014 19:29:31]  <IllFlower> No action's been taken against him, so he's just doing what he does. Going to school, presumably.
[05-Oct-2014 19:29:47]  <Rig> We haven't burned down a school in a while.
[05-Oct-2014 19:30:31]  <Leesh> Psh, Rin can do that on her own time.
[05-Oct-2014 19:30:50]  <BGTB2005> Last time a school was involved, I recall we helped blow up a baseball diamond
[05-Oct-2014 19:31:06]  <ponicalica> and then before that, a shed
[05-Oct-2014 19:31:24]  <BGTB2005> and I think the closest we ever got in the entire campaign was an athletics shed, but that was Kotomi's doing iirc
[05-Oct-2014 19:31:47]  <ponicalica> yeah that was kotomi
[05-Oct-2014 19:31:54]  <ponicalica> and now she's not an initiate anymore iirc
[05-Oct-2014 19:32:20]  <ponicalica> "So we investigate Karasuma, and see if he's been summoning witches?"
[05-Oct-2014 19:32:40]  <IllFlower> "That sounds like as good a first step as any.
[05-Oct-2014 19:32:49]  <IllFlower> "His familiar's requested that you meet with her as well."
[05-Oct-2014 19:32:52]  <Rig> Kazuki nods.
[05-Oct-2014 19:34:29]  <IllFlower> "Any other questions?" Shii asks.
[05-Oct-2014 19:35:49]  <Rig> Kazuki pauses before asking, "Why wasn't Karasuma's magic removed permenantly in the first place?"
[05-Oct-2014 19:38:37]  <IllFlower> "There wasn't enough against him to justify it. The most he did was attempt to magically firebomb another initiate's hideout, and even at that he wasn't particularly successful."
[05-Oct-2014 19:39:03]  <Rig> "So, he's more of a miscreant than a threat?"
[05-Oct-2014 19:39:19]  <BGTB2005> rin should teach him how it's done :V
[05-Oct-2014 19:39:30]  <ponicalica> we can't all firebomb hospitals, Rin
[05-Oct-2014 19:40:32]  <IllFlower> Rig: "Was. Let's hope he stiil is."
[05-Oct-2014 19:41:05]  <Rig> "One can hope."
[05-Oct-2014 19:42:03]  <IllFlower> Anything else?
[05-Oct-2014 19:42:13]  <Rig> I'm satisfied.
[05-Oct-2014 19:42:19]  <ponicalica> I'm good
[05-Oct-2014 19:42:23]  <Leesh> Same.
[05-Oct-2014 19:42:31]  <BGTB2005> same
[05-Oct-2014 19:42:37]  <IllFlower> Where to, then?
[05-Oct-2014 19:43:05]  <Rig> Meet with Karasuma's familiar?
[05-Oct-2014 19:43:06]  <BGTB2005> To Karasuma's familiar?
[05-Oct-2014 19:43:36]  <Leesh> Let's go meet with them, yeah.
[05-Oct-2014 19:43:42]  <ponicalica> yeah
[05-Oct-2014 19:44:23]  <IllFlower> Then off we go.

[05-Oct-2014 19:45:36]  <IllFlower> Karasuma's familiar is based in, for once, what appears to be the sort of place a person would actually care to live: a modest apartment overlooking a nearby park.
[05-Oct-2014 19:46:08]  <Leesh> I'm sure they're a weirdo then.
[05-Oct-2014 19:46:11]  <Rig> Is it furnished?
[05-Oct-2014 19:46:21]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@108-204-104-234.lightspeed.cicril.sbcglobal.net> has quit IRC (*.net *.split)
[05-Oct-2014 19:46:22]  *** AttObl_ is now known as AttObl
[05-Oct-2014 19:47:25]  <IllFlower> Several still-hot cups of tea sit on a low table in the center of the living area. There's a powered-off television in the corner, a bookshelf or two, and some other amenities.
[05-Oct-2014 19:47:46]  <Rig> What a weirdo.
[05-Oct-2014 19:47:50]  <IllFlower> The familiar herself bears a strong resemblance to a medium-sized dog.
[05-Oct-2014 19:48:22]  <IllFlower> "You must be the Conservators," she says as the party walks in. "I'm Asacchi."
[05-Oct-2014 19:49:16]  *** AttObl is now known as AttObl|Studying
[05-Oct-2014 19:49:36]  <ponicalica> Ayako nods.  "So you suspect Karasuma's been acusing trouble?"
[05-Oct-2014 19:49:43]  <Rig> Again, no introductions.
[05-Oct-2014 19:50:15]  <Rig> "Hello, Asacchi. I am Kazuki." He guestures towards Ayako. "Ayako has jumped right to the point, however."
[05-Oct-2014 19:50:23]  <IllFlower> Kazuki immediately notices that there are six cups of tea set out on the table, in spite of the fact that there are only five present. Actually, did familiars even drink tea?
[05-Oct-2014 19:51:11]  <ponicalica> much like Ayako, I don't have a good model of human communication sometimes
[05-Oct-2014 19:51:27]  <Rig> It's okay. We never introduce ourselves.
[05-Oct-2014 19:51:41]  <Leesh> "Greetings, Asacchi. I'm Hikari, pleased to make your acquaintance. You're having issues with Karasuma, yes?"
[05-Oct-2014 19:51:54]  *** Leesh is now known as ALicia
[05-Oct-2014 19:51:59]  <IllFlower> Just a second.

[05-Oct-2014 19:54:07]  <Rig> Kazuki takes a seat next to the table across from Asacchi.
[05-Oct-2014 19:54:17]  <Rig> *at the table across from
[05-Oct-2014 19:58:14]  <IllFlower> Rin just kind of silently shuffles off to the corner.
[05-Oct-2014 19:58:41]  <ponicalica> (Rin: "Not enough fire...")
[05-Oct-2014 19:58:43]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[05-Oct-2014 19:59:48]  <IllFlower> "Yes," Asacchi says. "I'm glad you're here. I was hoping to have another one of my initiates here to speak with you, but I'm afraid she's not here yet. There's some background we should speak of first, though."
[05-Oct-2014 20:01:15]  <IllFlower> Asacchi takes her place in front of one of the teacups. "Your familiar tells me that a couple of you have already had an encounter with Karasuma. Is that true?"
[05-Oct-2014 20:01:40]  <Rig> Kazuki looks to Ayako.
[05-Oct-2014 20:03:01]  <ponicalica> Ayako nods again.  "He was part of a cult we were investigating; there was a sort of war between two groups of initiates.
[05-Oct-2014 20:03:46]  <Alicia> Hikari nods. "That is correct. We ran into him some time back while dealing with a cult that he was in."
[05-Oct-2014 20:03:52]  *** Zia_ is now known as Zia
[05-Oct-2014 20:04:23]  <ponicalica> "He was in charge of an attack on an initiate who had holed herself up, and we convinced them to turn themselves in."
[05-Oct-2014 20:07:43]  <IllFlower> "I see. It looks like he has a taste for pitting people against each other, unfortunately.
[05-Oct-2014 20:08:37]  <Alicia> (Rin glares at Kazuki more, at the words)
[05-Oct-2014 20:08:59]  <ponicalica> i.e. he and Kazuki sure will be getting along :P
[05-Oct-2014 20:09:02]  <IllFlower> "A few of my charges have told me that Yukihiro's threatened them with bodily harm. I'm getting the sense that he's trying to engineer a split among my initiates."
[05-Oct-2014 20:09:25]  <Rig> "How many initiates are you in charge of at the moment?"
[05-Oct-2014 20:09:43]  <IllFlower> Asacchi sighs. "Unfortunately, I'd like to be more specific, but investigation is somewhat out of my jurisdiction. Especially since magic doesn't appear to be directly involved."

[05-Oct-2014 20:10:16]  <IllFlower> Rig: "Ten. It had been twelve, but one found another familiar and one resigned.
[05-Oct-2014 20:10:38]  <IllFlower> "The latter was an older initiate anyway, so her time was coming, but this was the last straw."
[05-Oct-2014 20:13:40]  <Rig> "You said you had another person you wanted us to speak with?"
[05-Oct-2014 20:15:00]  <IllFlower> "Yes, I did, but I'm not sure where Mi--" Asacchi begins, before she's interrupted by the sound of the outside door opening.
[05-Oct-2014 20:15:36]  <IllFlower> A girl's voice shouts, "Sorry I'm late!" from the entrance hallway.
[05-Oct-2014 20:16:58]  <IllFlower> It sounds familiar to Hikari, but before she can work out exactly who that voice belongs to, the girl walks out from behind the corner.
[05-Oct-2014 20:17:11]  <ponicalica> oh shit
[05-Oct-2014 20:18:07]  <Alicia> (Are u giving her a name or)
[05-Oct-2014 20:18:11]  <IllFlower> One can almost hear the sound of their jaws dropping simultaneously as they lay eyes on each other.
[05-Oct-2014 20:18:21]  <ponicalica> i think it's michi?
[05-Oct-2014 20:18:47]  <IllFlower> "You're my brother's--" the girl stutters out.
[05-Oct-2014 20:18:52]  <IllFlower> What was her name again?
[05-Oct-2014 20:19:05]  <IllFlower> Oh, right. Miho. Miho Takenaka. Junpei's older sister.
[05-Oct-2014 20:20:24]  <Alicia> Hikari turns around, managing to play it off just a bit more coolly than Miho. "Ah... It's been awhile, Miho, how have you been?" She begins casually, smiling.
[05-Oct-2014 20:20:40]  <Alicia> smiling casually*
[05-Oct-2014 20:21:45]  <Rig> Kazuki sips his tea quietly.
[05-Oct-2014 20:22:11]  <ponicalica> of course if it were Michi I'd probably be making more jokes about Gaim's Micchy to Alicia in PM
[05-Oct-2014 20:22:13]  <IllFlower> "Great. Terrific. Wonderful," Miho says in a somewhat disingenuous staccato.
[05-Oct-2014 20:23:08]  <IllFlower> "So you're a Conservator. My brother's best friend. A Conservator." She laughs.
[05-Oct-2014 20:24:32]  <IllFlower> It's clear from her awkward manner that Miho isn't nearly as close to Hikiar.
[05-Oct-2014 20:24:35]  <IllFlower> Hikari.
[05-Oct-2014 20:25:11]  <IllFlower> Iakhri.
[05-Oct-2014 20:25:15]  <IllFlower> One of those. You know.
[05-Oct-2014 20:25:47]  <IllFlower> Miho takes the empty spot at the table next to Asacchi and downs her whole cup of tea in one go.
[05-Oct-2014 20:25:53]  <Rig> Kazuki looks to Asacchi and then back to Miho then to Hikari.
[05-Oct-2014 20:26:03]  <Rig> Basically, his head is on a swivel.
[05-Oct-2014 20:26:56]  <Alicia> Hikari glances back, reflecting any stare with a frank grin.
[05-Oct-2014 20:27:03]  <IllFlower> "We were just talking about Yukihiro," Asacchi says as a jarringly gentle reminder to Miho.
[05-Oct-2014 20:28:34]  <IllFlower> Miho shakes her head as if to clear her mind. "He's dirt," she says. "There's not much to talk about."
[05-Oct-2014 20:28:40]  <IllFlower> Her eyes never do leave Hikari's face.
[05-Oct-2014 20:29:03]  <Rig> "While I'm sure you're right, we could use more information."
[05-Oct-2014 20:29:43]  <IllFlower> "I can't give much of it to you if you don't tell me what you're looking for.
[05-Oct-2014 20:29:57]  <IllFlower> "
[05-Oct-2014 20:30:09]  <ponicalica> "What has he been trying to do with the other initiates?"
[05-Oct-2014 20:30:22]  <IllFlower> Miho delivers her answer for Kazuki straight at Hikari.
[05-Oct-2014 20:30:37]  <Rig> Wow, I thought we were bad at social skills.
[05-Oct-2014 20:31:16]  <IllFlower> She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes.
[05-Oct-2014 20:32:23]  <IllFlower> "Right," Miho says, turning to look at someone else for the first time. "I don't think he has any objective in particular. Power as its own end, maybe.
[05-Oct-2014 20:33:27]  <IllFlower> "He wants backup. Sycophants, you could say. He hates being challenged.
[05-Oct-2014 20:33:35]  <IllFlower> "He's dirt. And I've only known him for two weeks."
[05-Oct-2014 20:35:34]  <Rig> "Is he just bullying people? No magic?"
[05-Oct-2014 20:37:07]  <IllFlower> "No magic, as far as I know. Otherwise we would have been able to run him up a pole by this point."
[05-Oct-2014 20:37:32]  <IllFlower> Miho's glance flicks back to Hikari once or twice. She's getting better at this.
[05-Oct-2014 20:38:27]  <Rig> "Does Karasuma have other initiates on his side yet?"
[05-Oct-2014 20:40:55]  <IllFlower> "Probably." Miho shakes her head in disgust. "I don't see any more than one or two at this point, though. He's probably going to see if he can scare up support."
[05-Oct-2014 20:41:40]  <BGTB2005> Rin, having spent most of her time silently glaring at Kazuki from the corner, speaks up. "Where can we find him?"
[05-Oct-2014 20:41:43]  <Rig> Kazuki sips his tea and contemplates actions.
[05-Oct-2014 20:41:48]  <Alicia> "Do you know what the other initiates that would be following him are like, Miho?"
[05-Oct-2014 20:43:40]  <IllFlower> Alicia: "Nothing concrete. I'm just guessing if he even has followers. But, like I said, sycophants."
[05-Oct-2014 20:44:20]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: "School. He's cocky, that's for sure. Doesn't even care to keep himself scarce."
[05-Oct-2014 20:45:35]  <ponicalica> "So if we go to his school, we'll probably be able to find him?"
[05-Oct-2014 20:45:57]  <Alicia> "He's certainly a character..." Hikari mutters.
[05-Oct-2014 20:46:36]  <IllFlower> "You're lucky," Miho says. "If I still had your job, I could smash his face in myself."
[05-Oct-2014 20:46:42]  <Alicia> (BGTB2005: I saw Rin flipping her head angrily in Kazuki/Miho's general directions while saying that.)

[05-Oct-2014 20:49:07]  <Alicia> "Well, we will be sure to deal with Yukihiro, Miho."
[05-Oct-2014 20:50:51]  <Alicia> Hikari ponders whether to ask Miho about that job, but decides that could be chatted about later.
[05-Oct-2014 20:52:01]  <Rig> "Is there anything else we should know?"
[05-Oct-2014 20:52:26]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Way to avoid the hard questions.
[05-Oct-2014 20:52:37]  <IllFlower> Rig: There's nothing else I can think of.
[05-Oct-2014 20:53:05]  <Alicia> IllFlower: I meant not at this moment.
[05-Oct-2014 20:54:14]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Way to avoid the hard questions for the moment.
[05-Oct-2014 20:54:19]  <Rig> How should we wrap up the scene?
[05-Oct-2014 20:54:27]  <Alicia> IllFlower: :<
[05-Oct-2014 20:54:47]  <ponicalica> to be fair, asking "Wait, were you a Conservator?  Why'd you get kicked out?" would be a bit rude
[05-Oct-2014 20:55:03]  <Rig> When has the ever stopped anyone?
[05-Oct-2014 20:55:28]  <Alicia> Rin might. Kazuki would. Hikari would ask it later.
[05-Oct-2014 20:55:54]  <Alicia> (By which I mean, after the others have left. :p)
[05-Oct-2014 20:57:06]  <ponicalica> Do you want everyone else to file out while you ask questions to Miho?
[05-Oct-2014 20:57:55]  <IllFlower> Asacchi steps in again. "Thank you," she says to the Conservators.
[05-Oct-2014 20:58:15]  <IllFlower> "Miho, can you stay here for another few minutes? I have more tea."
[05-Oct-2014 20:59:39]  <Rig> "Thank you for the information, Asacchi. Thank you, Miho." Kazuki stands.
[05-Oct-2014 21:00:06]  <IllFlower> Miho gives Kazuki a somewhat stiff nod.
[05-Oct-2014 21:00:53]  <ponicalica> "Yes, thank you, Asacchi, Miko."  Ayako also stands, and begins to file out.
[05-Oct-2014 21:01:44]  <Alicia> "Would you mind if I stayed for a bit longer, Asacchi?" Hikari looks from her to Miho.

[05-Oct-2014 21:04:00]  <Rig> "We'll wait outside," Kazuki says to Hikari.
[05-Oct-2014 21:04:07]  <IllFlower> Asacchi makes her way to the apartment's kitchen, like any good host would.
[05-Oct-2014 21:04:14]  <IllFlower> Something really is very strange about this familiar.
[05-Oct-2014 21:05:17]  <ponicalica> she acts almost normal and that's strange
[05-Oct-2014 21:05:36]  <IllFlower> "Is this about me?" Miho asks, glaring at Hikari.

[05-Oct-2014 21:06:55]  <Alicia> Hikari raises a hand. "Well, yes, Miho. I'm just curious. It's new, seeing someone I know from outside working with the Conservators and their familiars."
[05-Oct-2014 21:08:34]  <IllFlower> "'Curious,'" Miho echoes. "I guess you would be, wouldn't you?"
[05-Oct-2014 21:09:52]  <IllFlower> She shakes her head. "As far as I'm concerned, it's a bit of a kick to the stomach."
[05-Oct-2014 21:11:42]  <Alicia> Hikari drops her smile, staring back at Miho. "My being a Conservator...?" She waits. "I'm sorry, Miho, if I had known the topic was this uncomfortable for you..."
[05-Oct-2014 21:12:15]  <Rig> In the hall outside Rin tries to stare down an uncaring Kazuki.
[05-Oct-2014 21:12:17]  <IllFlower> "Don't. Please. I hate it when people try to be nice."
[05-Oct-2014 21:13:17]  <Alicia> Hikari nods, silently. Understanding, but a bit hurt nonetheless.
[05-Oct-2014 21:13:25]  <ponicalica> Rig: And Ayako probably shuffles awkwardly.
[05-Oct-2014 21:14:02]  <IllFlower> "You're curious, aren't you? You want to know the story?"
[05-Oct-2014 21:14:16]  <IllFlower> Asacchi sure is taking a long time with that tea. Maybe that's the consequence of not having hands.
[05-Oct-2014 21:14:49]  <Alicia> "Well, yes."
[05-Oct-2014 21:14:52]  <BGTB2005> who needs hands when you have magic :p
[05-Oct-2014 21:14:57]  <Rig> "I doubt Karasuma wants to drag magic into this, especially if he lacks followers. He might cave with a just a little pressure." Kazuki says. "Ayako, you've dealt with him before. Does he seem like he'd be much of a fight?"
[05-Oct-2014 21:16:45]  <ponicalica> "Hmm.  He seemed to fold pretty quickly when his followers changed their mind.  But we don't really know how he's doing in terms of followers."
[05-Oct-2014 21:18:02]  <Rig> Kazuki nods and goes quiet.
[05-Oct-2014 21:18:16]  <IllFlower> Alicia: "I was a Conservator. But I think you figured that out already.
[05-Oct-2014 21:19:50]  <Alicia> "Yes, with the mention of your old job... I figured it was something like that."
[05-Oct-2014 21:20:19]  <ponicalica> Ayako looks at Rin and says with a nervous chuckle: "He was a fire mage.  Like you."
[05-Oct-2014 21:20:22]  <IllFlower> "They paired me with this girl... she had a bit of a martyr complex. I always felt like she wanted to die saving someone. I didn't really *like* her, but she was competent, so I put up with it.
[05-Oct-2014 21:20:28]  <ponicalica> Lots of fire mages in this campaign
[05-Oct-2014 21:20:38]  <ponicalica> martyr complex: inb4 Jun
[05-Oct-2014 21:22:03]  <Alicia> (nervous chuckle. hehehe.)
[05-Oct-2014 21:22:50]  <IllFlower> "Then I got thrown under the bus. We had a few cults spring up in the space of a few months. Someone accused me of taking bribes to look the other way. She distanced herself from me so quickly you could hear the sonic boom.
[05-Oct-2014 21:23:41]  <IllFlower> "In the end, I got demoted, and she found another team. Then she died. Just as planned."
[05-Oct-2014 21:23:47]  <Rig> Hahahaha
[05-Oct-2014 21:23:49]  <Rig> hahahahahha
[05-Oct-2014 21:24:42]  <IllFlower> Miho taps her fingers against the table in a sort of annoyed melancholy.
[05-Oct-2014 21:25:36]  <IllFlower> "I bet it's been easy for you, huh? Just like Junpei. Always so carefree."
[05-Oct-2014 21:26:39]  <Alicia> Hikari tries her best not to show concern, though her face inevitably tightens at the mention of cults and demotion. "Miho, it's - no, not quite. Not with..."
[05-Oct-2014 21:27:39]  <IllFlower> "You've got something to say, don't you? Say it."
[05-Oct-2014 21:28:07]  <Alicia> She's prepared to mention the trainyard, and Yuuya, though her memory of the former is foggy, and her pride stops the other one from being mentioned.
[05-Oct-2014 21:28:57]  <Alicia> "I expected this to be different, even if I thought myself capable. I just didn't expect... to see people hurt the way I've seen them hurt, Miho." She dodges around the point.
[05-Oct-2014 21:29:25]  <Rig> Kazuki suddenly feels character development occuring.
[05-Oct-2014 21:30:17]  <ponicalica> lol
[05-Oct-2014 21:30:59]  <IllFlower> "They don't even have names. Like I said, carefree."
[05-Oct-2014 21:31:02]  <IllFlower> Miho laughs to herself.
[05-Oct-2014 21:32:01]  <Alicia> "And though I still can," Hikari arches her head towards the door a bit, then back. "The life of a Conservator-" she gulps at the carefree comment.
[05-Oct-2014 21:32:05]  <ponicalica> all others unknowing in eternal memory, jun taka, uh,...
[05-Oct-2014 21:32:15]  <ponicalica> takatora?
[05-Oct-2014 21:32:28]  <Rig> Takanashi.
[05-Oct-2014 21:32:32]  <IllFlower> "Whatever. It's the same for you as it was for Takanashi: I think you're hopelessly naive, but as long as you're competent, I'll put up with it."

[05-Oct-2014 21:33:36]  <IllFlower> Miho puts on a limp smile. "One year makes a huge difference, doesn't it."
[05-Oct-2014 21:35:08]  <Alicia> She lets out a breath. "It makes a real difference. For sure." Hikari smiles, though the grimace hiding behind it is fairly obvious.
[05-Oct-2014 21:35:52]  <IllFlower> "As long as you understand.
[05-Oct-2014 21:36:24]  <IllFlower> "I won't keep you. Go smash Yukihiro's face in. He deserves it."
[05-Oct-2014 21:36:27]  <Alicia> She sets down her cup, and stands up, turning towards the door. "I appreciate the help, Miho. And the talk. Rather sorry it had to go like this."
[05-Oct-2014 21:36:40]  <Alicia> (Urk, meant for that go go before IF's next comment.)
[05-Oct-2014 21:37:23]  <IllFlower> "Didn't I tell you I hate it when people try to be nice?"
[05-Oct-2014 21:37:45]  <IllFlower> Miho stares at Hikari, her expression admitting neither annoyance nor jest.
[05-Oct-2014 21:38:15]  <Alicia> "Sure thing, Miho. Take care now." Hikari ends with a half-hearted wave as she leaves for the door.
[05-Oct-2014 21:38:50]  <Rig> "Everything okay, Hikari?"
[05-Oct-2014 21:38:55]  <Alicia> A nod. "Sure. See you, then, Miho." Hikari exits promptly.
[05-Oct-2014 21:39:47]  <Alicia> She turns, bewildered, to Kazuki.
[05-Oct-2014 21:39:59]  <IllFlower> Not Ayako?
[05-Oct-2014 21:40:11]  <Alicia> Well, Kazuki asked. :v
[05-Oct-2014 21:40:25]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but he's a jerk.
[05-Oct-2014 21:40:39]  <ponicalica> and Ayako's not?
[05-Oct-2014 21:40:45]  <ponicalica> (well okay maybe she's less of one)
[05-Oct-2014 21:40:48]  <Rig> Ayako's just possessed.
[05-Oct-2014 21:41:04]  <Alicia> "No, no, it's all fine Kazuki. This was just a rather enlightening chat, you could say. I appreciate your asking, though." She responds quickly, her usual cheerfulness showing.
[05-Oct-2014 21:41:54]  <Alicia> Hikari steps off ahead of the others. "Well, anyway, don't we have some pressing business to attend to?"
[05-Oct-2014 21:42:06]  <Rig> Kazuki raises an eyebrow but let's Hikari keep her secrets.
[05-Oct-2014 21:42:09]  <IllFlower> Way to hide your troubles from your comrades.
[05-Oct-2014 21:42:36]  <Alicia> Yeah, but he's a jerk. <~~~ It'd be rude to ignore someone like that, IF.
[05-Oct-2014 21:42:50]  <IllFlower> So? ;)
[05-Oct-2014 21:42:58]  <Alicia> >Hikari
[05-Oct-2014 21:43:01]  <BGTB2005> He's still a jerk
[05-Oct-2014 21:43:03]  <ponicalica> Hikari at least tries not to be rude
[05-Oct-2014 21:43:32]  <ponicalica> she's the shining model of overly-politeness
[05-Oct-2014 21:44:07]  <Rig> So, now that we've gathered more secrets what's the plan?
[05-Oct-2014 21:45:05]  <Alicia> Time for a stakeout?
[05-Oct-2014 21:45:21]  <Rig> Why not go direct?
[05-Oct-2014 21:45:34]  *** Haruspex <~Glossina@wl-nat106.it.wsu.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[05-Oct-2014 21:45:41]  <BGTB2005> Rin wants to tail him to where he lives
[05-Oct-2014 21:45:52]  <Rig> So she can burn it down?
[05-Oct-2014 21:45:54]  <BGTB2005> and then loot the place for information
[05-Oct-2014 21:45:54]  <Alicia> True. I'm fine either way, I guess.
[05-Oct-2014 21:45:58]  <BGTB2005> and then yes
[05-Oct-2014 21:46:14]  <ponicalica> though I think what she really wants to burn down is Kazuki
[05-Oct-2014 21:46:25]  <Rig> He's not into Rin that way.
[05-Oct-2014 21:46:28]  <IllFlower> Is that a sex joke?
[05-Oct-2014 21:46:29]  <Alicia> BURNIN' DOWN THE HOUSE
[05-Oct-2014 21:46:48]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Even if it's not a sex joke, it's a sex joke.
[05-Oct-2014 21:47:19]  <Alicia> You could say we're rather attached to those around here.
[05-Oct-2014 21:47:54]  <Rig> Kazuki wouldn't oppose a stakeout. Their last direct action didn't turn out well.
[05-Oct-2014 21:48:11]  <Alicia> Indeed.
[05-Oct-2014 21:48:22]  <Alicia> Hikari is for staking out, naturally.
[05-Oct-2014 21:48:26]  <ponicalica> So a stakeout, like, hide around the school building and wait for him to come out?
[05-Oct-2014 21:48:30]  <Rig> Though we're approaching the endpoint.
[05-Oct-2014 21:48:37]  <Alicia> Some nerves might need to relax.
[05-Oct-2014 21:48:47]  <IllFlower> By "staking out," of course, Hikari means tying people to stakes.
[05-Oct-2014 21:49:09]  <IllFlower> Or handcuffing them to stakes. She's not picky.
[05-Oct-2014 21:49:20]  <Alicia> We all deal with stress differently.
[05-Oct-2014 21:49:24]  <ponicalica> I don't know if she's into Karasuma that way though
[05-Oct-2014 21:49:30]  <Alicia> Ahahahaha.
[05-Oct-2014 21:49:34]  <Alicia> Yeah. No.
[05-Oct-2014 21:49:59]  <BGTB2005> she only has eyes for Wataru
[05-Oct-2014 21:50:06]  <Alicia> Going against the Order is basically the antithesis of "Attractive"
[05-Oct-2014 21:50:18]  <Alicia> Or I'unno being like him.
[05-Oct-2014 21:51:09]  <IllFlower> So, uh, what *are* we doing?
[05-Oct-2014 21:51:21]  <Rig> I think we've decided to make sex jokes for a few hours.
[05-Oct-2014 21:51:31]  <ponicalica> I think some kind of stakeout is the consensus but you have to end the session soon, don't you?
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:03]  <Alicia> ^
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:04]  <IllFlower> Okay, then let's draw this to a close for now.
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:17]  <Rig> Okay, good session.
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:20]  <IllFlower> We'll pick up again in... well, who knows.
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:21]  <Rig> Thanks for running it.
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:28]  <Alicia> Thanks. I enjoyed it.
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:30]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, everyone.
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:39]  <Alicia> Hikari, though...
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:39]  <Rig> I think we're doing the next Shadowrig on Sunday.
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:40]  <ponicalica> thanks for GMing
[05-Oct-2014 21:52:49]  <IllFlower> Maybe one day one of your characters will learn to be honest with their feelings! ;)
