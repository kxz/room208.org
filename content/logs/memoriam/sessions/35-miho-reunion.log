@time=2014-10-05T21:48:11.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Indeed.
@time=2014-10-05T21:48:22.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari is for staking out, naturally.
@time=2014-10-05T21:48:26.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So a stakeout, like, hide around the school building and wait for him to come out?
@time=2014-10-05T21:48:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Though we're approaching the endpoint.
@time=2014-10-05T21:48:37.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Some nerves might need to relax.
@time=2014-10-05T21:48:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :By "staking out," of course, Hikari means tying people to stakes.
@time=2014-10-05T21:49:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or handcuffing them to stakes. She's not picky.
@time=2014-10-05T21:49:20.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We all deal with stress differently.
@time=2014-10-05T21:49:24.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't know if she's into Karasuma that way though
@time=2014-10-05T21:49:30.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ahahahaha.
@time=2014-10-05T21:49:34.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah. No.
@time=2014-10-05T21:49:59.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she only has eyes for Wataru
@time=2014-10-05T21:50:06.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Going against the Order is basically the antithesis of "Attractive"
@time=2014-10-05T21:50:18.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or I'unno being like him.
@time=2014-10-05T21:51:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, uh, what *are* we doing?
@time=2014-10-05T21:51:21.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think we've decided to make sex jokes for a few hours.
@time=2014-10-05T21:51:31.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think some kind of stakeout is the consensus but you have to end the session soon, don't you?
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :^
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, then let's draw this to a close for now.
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:17.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, good session.
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We'll pick up again in... well, who knows.
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:21.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for running it.
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:28.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks. I enjoyed it.
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for playing, everyone.
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:39.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari, though...
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:39.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think we're doing the next Shadowrig on Sunday.
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:40.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :thanks for GMing
@time=2014-10-05T21:52:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe one day one of your characters will learn to be honest with their feelings! ;)
