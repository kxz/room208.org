[22-Jun-2014 20:08:47]  <Rig> Okay, so, my concept is a magical boy.
[22-Jun-2014 20:08:52]  <ponicalica> *gasp*
[22-Jun-2014 20:08:59]  <Alicia> Not-gasp!
[22-Jun-2014 20:09:09]  <IllFlower> NAND gasp!
[22-Jun-2014 20:09:14]  <Alicia> !!!
[22-Jun-2014 20:09:17]  <Rig> I want him to be cheerful and unbroken by the terrible world IllFlower runs.
[22-Jun-2014 20:09:22]  <IllFlower> Well, anyway.
[22-Jun-2014 20:09:28]  <Rig> And I think he should have a history of magic in his family.
[22-Jun-2014 20:09:34]  <Rig> If that’s something we can do.
[22-Jun-2014 20:09:35]  <Alicia> So like Hikari - wait, never mind.
[22-Jun-2014 20:09:55]  <ponicalica> "thinks Ayako is a noob"
[22-Jun-2014 20:09:57]  * Barcode[boxcuttersinhislap] retreats into the sewers again.
[22-Jun-2014 20:09:59]  *** Barcode[boxcuttersinhislap] <~Barcode@2604:1500:8114:c300:52a:aa06:753f:7754> has left #madokamadness
[22-Jun-2014 20:10:06]  <IllFlower> Hikari's not exactly unbroken.
[22-Jun-2014 20:10:21]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[22-Jun-2014 20:10:32]  <IllFlower> Why don't we just proceed down the instructions...
[22-Jun-2014 20:10:42]  <Rig> Sure.
[22-Jun-2014 20:10:45]  <Rig> Background!
[22-Jun-2014 20:10:47]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Harpo Marx
[22-Jun-2014 20:10:52]  <Alicia> Lol.
[22-Jun-2014 20:11:04]  <Rig> Strong History, I’m thinking.
[22-Jun-2014 20:11:06]  <IllFlower> Seems like a Strong History character, yeah.
[22-Jun-2014 20:11:23]  <Rig> So, 13d6 in stats.
[22-Jun-2014 20:11:24]  <IllFlower> Could also go for Strong Community.
[22-Jun-2014 20:11:31]  <Rig> I’d like to go for History.
[22-Jun-2014 20:11:55]  <IllFlower> Okay, so he's his own man, kinda.
[22-Jun-2014 20:12:08]  <IllFlower> Go ahead and divide up those 13d6.
[22-Jun-2014 20:13:23]  <Rig> How does that look?
[22-Jun-2014 20:13:35]  <ponicalica> you don't need the "d6" part :p
[22-Jun-2014 20:13:37]  <Rig> Actually.
[22-Jun-2014 20:13:54]  <ponicalica> high-Ht to contrast
[22-Jun-2014 20:13:59]  <Alicia> Very heart.
[22-Jun-2014 20:14:05]  <BGTB2005> I'm counting 14?
[22-Jun-2014 20:14:06]  <IllFlower> He's got a bit of sensitivity to him, I see.
[22-Jun-2014 20:14:09]  <Rig> Much spirit
[22-Jun-2014 20:14:10]  <Rig> wow
[22-Jun-2014 20:14:22]  <IllFlower> Rather easily shaken.
[22-Jun-2014 20:14:23]  <Alicia> Yeah, I see 14.
[22-Jun-2014 20:14:31]  <IllFlower> Yeah, 3+4+5+2=14.
[22-Jun-2014 20:14:54]  <IllFlower> All right.
[22-Jun-2014 20:14:55]  <Rig> Should be fixed.
[22-Jun-2014 20:14:59]  <IllFlower> Rig's always playing the heartful one.
[22-Jun-2014 20:15:11]  <Rig> Need some compassion in the group.
[22-Jun-2014 20:15:15]  <Alicia> Hm, reminds me I still haven't added the two reflections. >_> But that can wait.
[22-Jun-2014 20:15:20]  <ponicalica> Alicia: nor've I :V
[22-Jun-2014 20:15:24]  <BGTB2005> same here
[22-Jun-2014 20:15:24]  <IllFlower> We'll get to it.
[22-Jun-2014 20:15:28]  <Alicia> Mmm.
[22-Jun-2014 20:15:31]  <Rig> So, does this work for stats?
[22-Jun-2014 20:15:43]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[22-Jun-2014 20:15:46]  <ponicalica> I think Ayako's most important bit in the last session was the fight with Rin
[22-Jun-2014 20:15:49]  <IllFlower> Let's move on to traits, shall we?
[22-Jun-2014 20:16:06]  <Rig> I’d like to do something kind of strange with this character.
[22-Jun-2014 20:16:22]  <Alicia> ponicalica: I think Hikari's was the fight/argument with Michi, and follow up with Shii.
[22-Jun-2014 20:16:24]  <IllFlower> He's got some d10s. Wonderful.
[22-Jun-2014 20:16:36]  <IllFlower> Rig: I'm all ears.
[22-Jun-2014 20:16:38]  <Rig> Because he’s been around magic so much I’d kind of like to give him a mark that he’s been around magic so much and it’s started to effect him.
[22-Jun-2014 20:16:47]  <IllFlower> A psychological mark?
[22-Jun-2014 20:16:53]  <Rig> And I think there is no more appropriate way than cat ears.
[22-Jun-2014 20:17:00]  <IllFlower> lololol.
[22-Jun-2014 20:17:00]  <BGTB2005> pfffff
[22-Jun-2014 20:17:01]  <Alicia> ...
[22-Jun-2014 20:17:11]  <IllFlower> Calling all Fioras.
[22-Jun-2014 20:17:28]  <ponicalica> Rig: omg
[22-Jun-2014 20:17:32]  <BGTB2005> speaking of, you should totally name him 'Ikuto'
[22-Jun-2014 20:17:37]  <ponicalica> *snerk*
[22-Jun-2014 20:17:40]  <Rig> So, I was thinking 1d6 - Feline features
[22-Jun-2014 20:18:08]  <IllFlower> Where would we go from there?
[22-Jun-2014 20:18:26]  <IllFlower> Hm, Rin already hates being wet...
[22-Jun-2014 20:18:30]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[22-Jun-2014 20:18:55]  <ponicalica> isn't Rin technically named after a cat
[22-Jun-2014 20:18:59]  <BGTB2005> sorta
[22-Jun-2014 20:19:03]  <IllFlower> Well, if you want him to have an affinity or something for cats, that would work.
[22-Jun-2014 20:19:19]  <IllFlower> "Feline features" seems a tad too restrictive. We can always just imagine those, haha.
[22-Jun-2014 20:19:35]  <IllFlower> Unless the strategy is "distract opponent with cat ears 1d6."
[22-Jun-2014 20:19:35]  <Rig> Maybe we can refine it to feline grace?
[22-Jun-2014 20:19:48]  <Alicia> Boy can jump.
[22-Jun-2014 20:19:55]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yeah, I like that.
[22-Jun-2014 20:19:55]  <Alicia> Sometimes.
[22-Jun-2014 20:21:07]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking with the background you provided having some kinds of specialized training would be useful.
[22-Jun-2014 20:21:13]  <IllFlower> For the d8 or d10 traits.
[22-Jun-2014 20:21:29]  <Rig> Yeah, I’m just not sure what those special trainings should be.
[22-Jun-2014 20:21:36]  <Rig> I’m not actually caught up on the logs.
[22-Jun-2014 20:21:46]  <Alicia> We dun messed up.
[22-Jun-2014 20:21:46]  <Rig> Are there any useful talents that would be called in at this point?
[22-Jun-2014 20:21:55]  <Rig> “Unfucks situations"
[22-Jun-2014 20:21:57]  <Rig> 3d10
[22-Jun-2014 20:21:59]  <ponicalica> "talking to people"
[22-Jun-2014 20:22:01]  <Alicia> Oh you meant like that.
[22-Jun-2014 20:22:07]  <Alicia> ponicalica: lolyeah.
[22-Jun-2014 20:22:13]  <IllFlower> We need someone who's good at de-escalating situations.
[22-Jun-2014 20:22:24]  <IllFlower> Plenty of ability to do the opposite here...
[22-Jun-2014 20:22:27]  <Alicia> 2d8 Smooth talker.
[22-Jun-2014 20:22:51]  <Rig> How about “Cool negotiator"?
[22-Jun-2014 20:23:47]  <IllFlower> What would "cool" mean here?
[22-Jun-2014 20:23:52]  <Rig> Heh.
[22-Jun-2014 20:23:54]  <Rig> Calm.
[22-Jun-2014 20:23:55]  <IllFlower> I have an idea, just want to be concrete.
[22-Jun-2014 20:23:56]  <BGTB2005> calm and collected?
[22-Jun-2014 20:24:13]  <IllFlower> Also, if you turn around and add a "spicy" trait I might have to punch you.
[22-Jun-2014 20:24:21]  <Rig> ¬.¬
[22-Jun-2014 20:24:29]  <Alicia> Snerk.
[22-Jun-2014 20:24:33]  * Rig realizes that his jig is up.
[22-Jun-2014 20:24:36]  * Rig goose is cooked
[22-Jun-2014 20:24:42]  <Rig> *Rig's
[22-Jun-2014 20:24:49]  <IllFlower> i_see_what_youre_doing_there.jpg
[22-Jun-2014 20:25:00]  <Alicia> Rig's jig can no longer be fibbed, I say.
[22-Jun-2014 20:25:06]  <Rig> Anyway, so, 2d8 on negotiation?
[22-Jun-2014 20:25:17]  <IllFlower> Yeah, looks about right.
[22-Jun-2014 20:25:27]  <IllFlower> Levelheadedness is definitely something lacking in this group.
[22-Jun-2014 20:25:32]  <Alicia> <_< >_>
[22-Jun-2014 20:25:37]  <BGTB2005> <_<
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:00]  <ponicalica> >_>
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:07]  <ponicalica> hey, Ayako can be level-headed...sometimes
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:07]  <IllFlower> I could even see it as a bit of naivete.
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:10]  <BGTB2005> yeah we need a responsible adult
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:15]  <imitationponigiri> Buncha hotheads
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:20]  <BGTB2005> >_>
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:21]  <Alicia> "I'm responsible nyaaaaa~"
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:26]  <IllFlower> "Can't we just talk to the murderous rampaging initiate?"
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:28]  <Rig> How about I drop one of the d10s into something like “Knowledge of scrying rituals” or maybe “Buearcratic inroads”
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:50]  <IllFlower> The latter seems more like it'd work for a relationship.
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:53]  <Rig> Like, something that gives the group the skills to navigate a challenge from an angle that doesn’t involve finding the bad guy and punching them.
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:54]  <ponicalica> A connection in the magical world would be a yeah
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:56]  <Rig> Yeah, that’s true.
[22-Jun-2014 20:26:59]  <IllFlower> Ritual knowledge would be good, however.
[22-Jun-2014 20:27:28]  <IllFlower> Should that be more specific?
[22-Jun-2014 20:27:35]  <Rig> Probably.
[22-Jun-2014 20:27:42]  <IllFlower> Oh, you put scrying in, okay.
[22-Jun-2014 20:27:42]  <Rig> Any ideas on how to narrow it down?
[22-Jun-2014 20:27:48]  <Rig> Oh, okay. Is that good?
[22-Jun-2014 20:28:16]  <IllFlower> In terms of divinations usually what we end up needing is "where is this person" so that might be handy.
[22-Jun-2014 20:28:31]  <IllFlower> Although, actually, hold on a second, I'm not sure how you could do that in conflict.
[22-Jun-2014 20:28:40]  <IllFlower> Maybe it'd be more of a generic "can read magic" kind of thing?
[22-Jun-2014 20:29:06]  <IllFlower> "MY MAGIC SENSE IS TINGLING"
[22-Jun-2014 20:29:06]  *** Saladofstones <~Saladofst@pool-173-51-83-42.lsanca.fios.verizon.net> has joined #madokamadness
[22-Jun-2014 20:29:07]  <Rig> How would that work? They’d have like a really precise understanding of how magic flows around things?
[22-Jun-2014 20:29:26]  <Alicia> 1d10 Can read the (magical) atmosphere.
[22-Jun-2014 20:29:27]  <ponicalica> Maybe intuitive from being around magic so much?
[22-Jun-2014 20:29:53]  <IllFlower> Rig: Something like that. Imagine something a bit New Age, I guess.
[22-Jun-2014 20:29:58]  <BGTB2005> Scrying would be useful in tracking someone but I'm not sure how that would translate to conflict
[22-Jun-2014 20:30:01]  <Fiora> IllFlower: cat ears?
[22-Jun-2014 20:30:03]  <Rig> “The crystal energy, man."
[22-Jun-2014 20:30:12]  <IllFlower> Oh, there she is.
[22-Jun-2014 20:30:14]  <ponicalica> Fiora: rig's character has cat ears and is cool and maybe spicy
[22-Jun-2014 20:30:20]  <Fiora> :O
[22-Jun-2014 20:30:28]  <BGTB2005> And should be named Ikuto
[22-Jun-2014 20:30:34]  <ponicalica> ("but amu was the one who was cool and/or spicy!")
[22-Jun-2014 20:30:47]  <IllFlower> Rig: You could probably broadly apply that trait, but it makes sense as a catch-all.
[22-Jun-2014 20:31:02]  <IllFlower> It's a proxy for his insider experience.
[22-Jun-2014 20:31:15]  <Rig> Should I roll that trait down to a d8? or is a d10 fine?
[22-Jun-2014 20:31:23]  <Alicia> Hikari, you need to learn some magix. :V
[22-Jun-2014 20:31:33]  <IllFlower> He's been around for a while, right? 1d10 is okay with me.
[22-Jun-2014 20:31:40]  <Rig> Yeah, that’d be good.
[22-Jun-2014 20:31:52]  <Rig> I was thinking a d6 or d8 for upward ambition.
[22-Jun-2014 20:32:11]  <ponicalica> hoping to get the prophetship from his dad?
[22-Jun-2014 20:32:15]  <IllFlower> He started out big and wants to keep it that way.
[22-Jun-2014 20:32:17]  <Rig> Pretty much.
[22-Jun-2014 20:32:30]  <Alicia> Better than resting on those laurels.
[22-Jun-2014 20:32:34]  <Rig> I’m thinking if we phrase it that way then it should be a d8.
[22-Jun-2014 20:32:35]  <BGTB2005> Alicia: might be something to take as reflection?
[22-Jun-2014 20:32:44]  <BGTB2005> possibly?
[22-Jun-2014 20:32:47]  <IllFlower> I'm okay with it being a d8 trait.
[22-Jun-2014 20:32:48]  <Alicia> BGTB2005: Yeah, I dunno.
[22-Jun-2014 20:33:06]  <IllFlower> Is he open about this ambition, or is it more of something he plays close to his chest?
[22-Jun-2014 20:33:06]  <BGTB2005> ("Hey Ayako I wanna learn some cool magic.")
[22-Jun-2014 20:33:40]  <Rig> I’m thinking it’s a subtle ambition.
[22-Jun-2014 20:33:44]  <Rig> Not like shonen level ambitions.
[22-Jun-2014 20:34:04]  <IllFlower> And he's not arrogant about it either, I take it.
[22-Jun-2014 20:34:11]  <ponicalica> ("Oh my god, Ayako, this is so boring.  How do you do this?")
[22-Jun-2014 20:34:15]  <Rig> No. Just aware of what he needs to do.
[22-Jun-2014 20:34:20]  <IllFlower> But he thinks it's his place all the same.
[22-Jun-2014 20:34:28]  <IllFlower> Okay, cool.
[22-Jun-2014 20:34:43]  <Rig> Of course. He’s always been at the adult table and resents the kiddie table.
[22-Jun-2014 20:34:46]  <Alicia> ("I can't make this staff even float, damn it!")
[22-Jun-2014 20:34:47]  <IllFlower> So we have 2d6 2d10 left.
[22-Jun-2014 20:35:27]  <IllFlower> Rig: Hm, that's interesting. He seems like he'd be a bit more patient with that sort of thing.
[22-Jun-2014 20:35:28]  <Alicia> can't even*
[22-Jun-2014 20:35:54]  <Rig> I don’t think resentment implies impatience.
[22-Jun-2014 20:36:04]  <IllFlower> The resentment might be more taking it out on himself, I guess?
[22-Jun-2014 20:36:17]  <Rig> I think that’s a good interpretation. “I can do better.”
[22-Jun-2014 20:36:26]  <IllFlower> He has high standards.
[22-Jun-2014 20:36:43]  <Rig> I want to put the 2d6 into avoiding violence. I’m thinking we can lump that into 2d6 and call it “Willing to cut and run” or split it into two d6 traits. One for “I know when to fold” and one for “I tend to redirect conflict rather than face it head on."
[22-Jun-2014 20:36:56]  <IllFlower> A bit of an introspective character. Maybe he'll get along well with Ayako.
[22-Jun-2014 20:37:18]  <Alicia> He's like if Hikari knew how to talk rather than punch, minus the whole Born Into This thing.
[22-Jun-2014 20:37:30]  <IllFlower> Rig: You can do something like "picks his battles 2d6."
[22-Jun-2014 20:37:30]  <Alicia> transferred her punching power into talking power*
[22-Jun-2014 20:37:40]  <Rig> IllFlower: I like that.
[22-Jun-2014 20:38:16]  <Rig> If everyone is good with that then we only have 2d10 left.
[22-Jun-2014 20:38:18]  <ponicalica> what's the talking version of brass knux though
[22-Jun-2014 20:38:20]  <IllFlower> It's a little bendy in terms of conflict but I could definitely see it as something to roll when he doesn't want to escalate the level of conflict.
[22-Jun-2014 20:38:27]  <Alicia> ponicalica: I dunno, smooth talker?
[22-Jun-2014 20:38:49]  <Alicia> Shrug
[22-Jun-2014 20:39:00]  <IllFlower> Might be a little weird rolling dice for not prolonging conflict but I think we can shake it.
[22-Jun-2014 20:39:12]  <Rig> I like that idea that escalating for this character is a bad idea.
[22-Jun-2014 20:39:20]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[22-Jun-2014 20:39:31]  <Alicia> I do too.
[22-Jun-2014 20:39:38]  <ponicalica> Yeah.
[22-Jun-2014 20:39:41]  <Rig> But I’d like to have at least 1d10 (or maybe 2) that can be pulled in if something goes south.
[22-Jun-2014 20:39:43]  <Alicia> Won't get along with Rin at all, it feels like.
[22-Jun-2014 20:39:56]  <IllFlower> Well, he does have the sense for magic, that'll come in handy in really bad situations.
[22-Jun-2014 20:40:01]  <Rig> True.
[22-Jun-2014 20:40:05]  <Rig> I do like that.
[22-Jun-2014 20:40:07]  <IllFlower> Something physical to go along with that might be helpful.
[22-Jun-2014 20:40:14]  <ponicalica> parkour? :P
[22-Jun-2014 20:40:17]  <Rig> Any ideas for those last dice though? I’m at a loss.
[22-Jun-2014 20:40:37]  <Alicia> I like parkour, heh.
[22-Jun-2014 20:40:45]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking back to the whole jumping thing we mentioned as a joke.
[22-Jun-2014 20:40:50]  <Rig> He.
[22-Jun-2014 20:40:52]  <Rig> *Heh
[22-Jun-2014 20:41:01]  <Alicia> "Why the hell won't my magic hit this kid!?"
[22-Jun-2014 20:41:02]  <Rig> Well, 1d10 in “Jump Good"

[22-Jun-2014 20:41:36]  <IllFlower> "Done jumpin' good, I reckon 1d10"
[22-Jun-2014 20:41:56]  <Alicia> Rig: God, that show.
[22-Jun-2014 20:42:07]  <ponicalica> that show was awesome
[22-Jun-2014 20:42:11]  <BGTB2005> yes
[22-Jun-2014 20:42:18]  <IllFlower> "Disarming bishie smile 1d10"
[22-Jun-2014 20:42:33]  <Rig> “Can notice you"
[22-Jun-2014 20:42:35]  <Alicia> 1d10 Cutie.
[22-Jun-2014 20:42:45]  <IllFlower> "Is everyone's senpai 1d10"
[22-Jun-2014 20:43:17]  <IllFlower> Maybe he knows a little aikido, I can imagine that coming in useful.
[22-Jun-2014 20:43:34]  <Rig> Yeah, that’d be fitting. So 1d10 for aikido?
[22-Jun-2014 20:44:16]  <IllFlower> I like it.
[22-Jun-2014 20:44:23]  <IllFlower> ("You suggested it.")
[22-Jun-2014 20:44:38]  <Rig> Approving your own pull request.
[22-Jun-2014 20:44:49]  <IllFlower> awwwwww yeah
[22-Jun-2014 20:45:29]  <Rig> How about invisibility or some practical form of it?
[22-Jun-2014 20:45:39]  <ponicalica> that could be useful
[22-Jun-2014 20:45:47]  <ponicalica> didn't Michi or someone have that?
[22-Jun-2014 20:45:53]  <IllFlower> Satsuki had it.
[22-Jun-2014 20:46:02]  <IllFlower> As well, I should say.
[22-Jun-2014 20:46:15]  <IllFlower> Motoko did too. I really have no original ideas.
[22-Jun-2014 20:46:36]  <IllFlower> Rig: I like that one. Sneak attacks, but only when magic is involved?
[22-Jun-2014 20:46:55]  <Rig> Yeah, kinda like you can’t find him by tracing his magic and his magic can’t be traced.
[22-Jun-2014 20:47:04]  <ponicalica> "Trace, on."
[22-Jun-2014 20:47:08]  <Rig> Or rather his ranged magic stuff can’t be traced back to him.
[22-Jun-2014 20:47:30]  <IllFlower> At least not magically.
[22-Jun-2014 20:47:39]  <Rig> Yeah.
[22-Jun-2014 20:47:43]  <IllFlower> If you use tracer bullets you might be in a bit of a bind. :p
[22-Jun-2014 20:47:48]  <Rig> So, are those all good traits?
[22-Jun-2014 20:47:54]  <BGTB2005> Rin's got that covered
[22-Jun-2014 20:48:06]  <IllFlower> Let me go over them real quick...
[22-Jun-2014 20:49:28]  <IllFlower> So we have a level-headed guy who prefers a good defense. His experience with the fundamentals of magic is the ace up his sleeve. He has high standards for himself and doesn't contemplate settling for less.
[22-Jun-2014 20:49:40]  <IllFlower> He may have cat ears.
[22-Jun-2014 20:49:49]  <Rig> Highly likely.
[22-Jun-2014 20:50:22]  <Alicia> I quite like the sound of this guy. /not biased at all
[22-Jun-2014 20:50:34]  <Alicia> Except for the good defense, but eh. :p
[22-Jun-2014 20:51:03]  <IllFlower> Okay, I'm good. Anything from the other players?
[22-Jun-2014 20:51:20]  <BGTB2005> seems good
[22-Jun-2014 20:51:22]  <Alicia> I'm good.
[22-Jun-2014 20:51:24]  <ponicalica> Sounds good to me
[22-Jun-2014 20:51:29]  <Alicia> Good.
[22-Jun-2014 20:51:38]  <IllFlower> All right, let's do relationships, then.
[22-Jun-2014 20:52:00]  <Rig> Okay, clearly need one for Conservators.
[22-Jun-2014 20:52:03]  <IllFlower> Yup.
[22-Jun-2014 20:52:07]  <Rig> Thinking that’d be a d8.
[22-Jun-2014 20:52:08]  <ponicalica> You mentioned magical contacts/bureaucratic etc. during the thing, too
[22-Jun-2014 20:52:11]  <ponicalica> during trait
[22-Jun-2014 20:52:30]  <IllFlower> Well, his father (or at least his father's status) seems pretty important to him.
[22-Jun-2014 20:52:45]  <Rig> Yeah, probably want to put that as a d8 too.
[22-Jun-2014 20:52:50]  <IllFlower> Or maybe he's doing it all to impress some girl, who knows.
[22-Jun-2014 20:53:21]  <IllFlower> ("Yuna, duh")
[22-Jun-2014 20:53:23]  <Alicia> ("That Rin girl. I don't like how she interacts with others at all but dang she's cute.")
[22-Jun-2014 20:53:57]  <BGTB2005> speaking of, her old friend still needs a name
[22-Jun-2014 20:54:11]  <IllFlower> "Old friend-san"
[22-Jun-2014 20:54:17]  <Alicia> xD
[22-Jun-2014 20:54:36]  <IllFlower> Rig: I think the d4 relationship would be an interesting one to assign as well.
[22-Jun-2014 20:54:48]  <IllFlower> The last two were kind of obvious, so this would make a good wildcard.
[22-Jun-2014 20:54:50]  <Rig> Definitely.
[22-Jun-2014 20:55:00]  <Rig> The question is where to assign it?
[22-Jun-2014 20:55:06]  <IllFlower> "Estranged mother 1d4"
[22-Jun-2014 20:55:08]  <IllFlower> Random thought.
[22-Jun-2014 20:55:08]  <Rig> An old girlfriend that’s gone kinda rogue?
[22-Jun-2014 20:55:15]  <BGTB2005> hmmmm
[22-Jun-2014 20:55:28]  <IllFlower> Rig's characters are always haunted by their exes, aren't they.
[22-Jun-2014 20:55:32]  <Rig> Heh.
[22-Jun-2014 20:55:34]  <ponicalica> heh
[22-Jun-2014 20:55:38]  <Rig> Yeah, let’s avoid that then.
[22-Jun-2014 20:55:56]  <Rig> Estranged mother seems like a good place to throw some plot points down the road.
[22-Jun-2014 20:56:00]  <IllFlower> Or another prophet who betrayed his father or something.
[22-Jun-2014 20:56:28]  <IllFlower> We had a little of that with Hibiki but her character didn't get much of a chance to show it.
[22-Jun-2014 20:56:39]  <Rig> Well, like, do we want to go with a selfish desire for revenge kinda feel or a “wants to know what happened to his mom” kinda feel?
[22-Jun-2014 20:56:49]  <IllFlower> Is she magical or not, also?
[22-Jun-2014 20:57:11]  <Alicia> I like the selfish desire idea. Sounds like something he wouldn't want to talk much about, and it is 1d4.
[22-Jun-2014 20:57:12]  <Rig> We could swing that as nonmagical and that’s why she’s estranged?
[22-Jun-2014 20:57:21]  <Rig> Hm.
[22-Jun-2014 20:57:33]  <ponicalica> Sort of reminds me of the "not used to talking about nonmagical things" thing Ayako had going a bit
[22-Jun-2014 20:57:41]  <Alicia> Although not revenge necessarily. I mean otherwise he's a goody-goody but with this little nagging issue.
[22-Jun-2014 20:57:46]  <Alicia> Nagging issues are fun.
[22-Jun-2014 20:57:51]  <IllFlower> Maybe he's torn between his magical ambition and his mother's absence.
[22-Jun-2014 20:58:03]  <Rig> Both of these are good.
[22-Jun-2014 20:58:14]  <Rig> Perhaps a vote from other players?

[22-Jun-2014 20:59:37]  <IllFlower> What would the revenge be about?
[22-Jun-2014 20:59:45]  <IllFlower> Alicia's idea and mine, I think.
[22-Jun-2014 20:59:48]  <Rig> Yeah.
[22-Jun-2014 21:00:05]  <ponicalica> hmm
[22-Jun-2014 21:00:14]  <ponicalica> that's a tough choice
[22-Jun-2014 21:00:48]  <Rig> What sort of choices do prophets make inside the magic world?
[22-Jun-2014 21:00:49]  <IllFlower> If we were to go with Alicia's idea, I could see it as resentment that his mother never really accepted magic.
[22-Jun-2014 21:01:07]  <Alicia> Once I'M magical, you WILL see how good I am!
[22-Jun-2014 21:01:09]  <IllFlower> Or, like, an undermining of his confidence.
[22-Jun-2014 21:01:14]  <Alicia> And if you don't SCREW YOU.
[22-Jun-2014 21:01:21]  <Rig> “Maybe magic isn’t everything”?

[22-Jun-2014 21:01:27]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yeah, something like that.
[22-Jun-2014 21:01:37]  <Rig> I think we’ll go with the mother.
[22-Jun-2014 21:01:37]  <Alicia> Magic isn't everything is nice. He's grown up with it forever.
[22-Jun-2014 21:01:40]  <IllFlower> In terms of what decisions the higher-ups make, I've never really elaborated on that.
[22-Jun-2014 21:02:04]  <IllFlower> Presumably they're grand ideas about THE FUTURE OF GLOBAL MAGIC or something.
[22-Jun-2014 21:02:13]  <Rig> Innovating magic.
[22-Jun-2014 21:02:17]  <Rig> MageOS 8
[22-Jun-2014 21:02:21]  <IllFlower> I just imagined all of the prophets as university professors sitting around a table.
[22-Jun-2014 21:02:27]  <Rig> Heh
[22-Jun-2014 21:02:42]  <IllFlower> That would sadly not be too far off in terms of gender balance.
[22-Jun-2014 21:03:02]  <Rig> Okay, so, let’s leave the 3d6 for future relationships and settle for those 3.
[22-Jun-2014 21:03:12]  <IllFlower> I like 'em.
[22-Jun-2014 21:03:14]  <Alicia> Yeah, sounds good.
[22-Jun-2014 21:03:17]  <ponicalica> yeah, sounds good
[22-Jun-2014 21:03:18]  <IllFlower> Anything before we move to the belongings?
[22-Jun-2014 21:03:19]  <Alicia> I like it.
[22-Jun-2014 21:03:29]  <Rig> I’m good.
[22-Jun-2014 21:03:34]  <BGTB2005> sure
[22-Jun-2014 21:03:45]  <IllFlower> Cool, then on we go.
[22-Jun-2014 21:03:56]  <IllFlower> Gotta have a costume and maybe a magical weapon, at least.
[22-Jun-2014 21:04:22]  <Alicia> Magical shield.
[22-Jun-2014 21:04:29]  <IllFlower> RIP Jun.
[22-Jun-2014 21:04:32]  <Rig> Heh
[22-Jun-2014 21:04:33]  <ponicalica> hahaha
[22-Jun-2014 21:04:36]  <Alicia> I meant like an actual shield.
[22-Jun-2014 21:04:37]  <BGTB2005> ;_;
[22-Jun-2014 21:04:46]  <ponicalica> Captain Amerijun
[22-Jun-2014 21:04:47]  <Alicia> That he whaps people with.
[22-Jun-2014 21:05:01]  <Alicia> To go with the whole better a good defense thing.
[22-Jun-2014 21:05:11]  <IllFlower> lol.
[22-Jun-2014 21:05:17]  <IllFlower> Rig: What're the boots?
[22-Jun-2014 21:05:22]  <BGTB2005> I think magical stomping boots work too
[22-Jun-2014 21:05:31]  <IllFlower> If they're a reference, it's over my head.
[22-Jun-2014 21:05:37]  <ponicalica> Super (Rig's char's name) Bros

The boot allows the person wearing them to take strides of seven leagues per step, resulting in great speed. The boots are often (+65 more characters)
[22-Jun-2014 21:05:47]  <Alicia> Niiiice.
[22-Jun-2014 21:05:56]  <BGTB2005> or mgic running boots
[22-Jun-2014 21:06:01]  <IllFlower> He be fast.

[22-Jun-2014 21:08:15]  <IllFlower> Hahaha, he got so sick of people teasing him about being catlike that he uses them to preempt the joke.
[22-Jun-2014 21:08:39]  <Alicia> "You think you're so clever huh. :|"
[22-Jun-2014 21:08:58]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking of what people who go to Harvard on, like, fifth-generation legacy might have.

[22-Jun-2014 21:20:49]  <ponicalica> pffff
[22-Jun-2014 21:20:54]  <BGTB2005> that's how it works, no?
[22-Jun-2014 21:21:09]  <ponicalica> "Likes being tied up by Hikari"
[22-Jun-2014 21:21:15]  <Alicia> "Hikari, why do you -" "Oh, well I just like them, you know?" "..."
[22-Jun-2014 21:21:29]  <Alicia> Alt: "Don't ask, don't get in there!"
[22-Jun-2014 21:21:54]  <Alicia> But yeah think up a name yo.
[22-Jun-2014 21:22:04]  <ponicalica> IllFlower might be the one to do that
[22-Jun-2014 21:22:36]  <Rig> How about Tetsuo?
[22-Jun-2014 21:23:38]  <ponicalica> I feel like it should be something aristocratic, but I wouldn't know shit about that so we'd have to wait for IF
[22-Jun-2014 21:23:42]  <Alicia> Tetsuooo, etc.
[22-Jun-2014 21:23:44]  <IllFlower> Doesn't sound elitist enough.
[22-Jun-2014 21:23:55]  <Alicia> Also, agreed with ponners and IF.
[22-Jun-2014 21:24:07]  <IllFlower> I was thinking we could give him a girly last name for kicks.
[22-Jun-2014 21:24:10]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[22-Jun-2014 21:24:18]  <IllFlower> Like Sakura or something.
[22-Jun-2014 21:24:31]  <Rig> First name Ichiro?
[22-Jun-2014 21:24:33]  <ponicalica> ("No, Kyouko's my sister")
[22-Jun-2014 21:24:47]  <IllFlower> Does he play baseball?
[22-Jun-2014 21:25:13]  <Rig> For the Yankees.
[22-Jun-2014 21:25:24]  <IllFlower> lol.

[22-Jun-2014 21:25:41]  <IllFlower> Hm, we didn't have this problem when we did this the first time, did we.
[22-Jun-2014 21:25:50]  <IllFlower> Because we put a whole week in between character creation and initiations.
[22-Jun-2014 21:26:09]  <Rig> Yeah, I don’t think so.
[22-Jun-2014 21:26:33]  <ponicalica> Is there a good surname with "Neko" in it? :p
[22-Jun-2014 21:26:46]  <IllFlower> Nekota.

[22-Jun-2014 21:29:01]  <Alicia> Kazuki Nekota.
[22-Jun-2014 21:29:03]  <Rig> Banjo and Kazuki.
[22-Jun-2014 21:29:04]  <IllFlower> Kazuki Sakura.
[22-Jun-2014 21:29:17]  <Alicia> I like Sakura more. It's a nice name.
[22-Jun-2014 21:29:29]  <IllFlower> Lots of nice hard "k" sounds.
[22-Jun-2014 21:29:35]  <Alicia> :3
[22-Jun-2014 21:29:36]  <Rig> Okay.
[22-Jun-2014 21:29:51]  <IllFlower> Anyway, we have about half an hour left, let's see if we can cram some initiation into here.
[22-Jun-2014 21:30:01]  <Rig> We can do it!
[22-Jun-2014 21:30:09]  <IllFlower> Okay, so what's his challenge?
[22-Jun-2014 21:30:10]  <Alicia> Git ar inition on.
[22-Jun-2014 21:30:45]  <Alicia> Sakura~
[22-Jun-2014 21:30:51]  <IllFlower> I've arbitrarily decided his name means "peace tree."
[22-Jun-2014 21:30:57]  <IllFlower> So good at this.
[22-Jun-2014 21:30:59]  <Rig> How about convincing someone to give him access to something he shouldn’t have?
[22-Jun-2014 21:31:19]  <IllFlower> Boy's being ambitious, eh.
[22-Jun-2014 21:31:33]  <Rig> Yeah.
[22-Jun-2014 21:31:44]  <IllFlower> Hm, okay. What would it be?
[22-Jun-2014 21:31:46]  <Rig> I don’t want it to be something dangerous, so much as just something he shouldn’t have.
[22-Jun-2014 21:31:57]  <Rig> So, maybe access to a restricted part of the conservator library?
[22-Jun-2014 21:31:57]  <Alicia> The full plate of cookies.
[22-Jun-2014 21:32:01]  <IllFlower> He wants to steal into some chamber of the prophets, just 'cause.
[22-Jun-2014 21:32:08]  <IllFlower> Curiosity.
[22-Jun-2014 21:32:10]  <Rig> The chamberprophets
[22-Jun-2014 21:32:17]  <Rig> I like that.
[22-Jun-2014 21:32:18]  <IllFlower> Singing group!
[22-Jun-2014 21:32:34]  <BGTB2005> Kazuki Sakura and the Chamber of Prophets
[22-Jun-2014 21:32:36]  <IllFlower> They actually do musicals.
[22-Jun-2014 21:32:38]  <Alicia> That's so going to be my new choral group.
[22-Jun-2014 21:32:41]  <Alicia> @ BGTB2005
[22-Jun-2014 21:33:14]  <IllFlower> How about he wants to get into a meeting his father's in?
[22-Jun-2014 21:33:22]  <Rig> I think that works.
[22-Jun-2014 21:33:29]  <IllFlower> s/meeting/conclave/ da-dun
[22-Jun-2014 21:33:39]  <IllFlower> Okay, so there's someone standing at the door guarding it...
[22-Jun-2014 21:33:44]  <IllFlower> Presumably, at least.
[22-Jun-2014 21:33:46]  <ponicalica> electing the new empope?
[22-Jun-2014 21:33:48]  <Rig> One would hope.
[22-Jun-2014 21:33:54]  <Alicia> That'd be dope.
[22-Jun-2014 21:33:59]  <IllFlower> Who knows, maybe it's all charms or something.
[22-Jun-2014 21:34:13]  <Rig> I think we should go with a physical guard.
[22-Jun-2014 21:34:17]  <IllFlower> There's a man standing outside the door in some very hooded hooded robes.
[22-Jun-2014 21:34:25]  <Rig> Impressively hooded.
[22-Jun-2014 21:34:43]  <IllFlower> You want to talk him into giving you access.
[22-Jun-2014 21:34:50]  <IllFlower> Or rather Kazuki does.
[22-Jun-2014 21:34:57]  <Rig> Kazuki strides up, doing his best to look impressive, and tries to just walk by the guard.
[22-Jun-2014 21:35:15]  <IllFlower> We should probably roll dice, haha.

[22-Jun-2014 22:03:03]  <Rig> So, 1d6 trait.
[22-Jun-2014 22:03:08]  <IllFlower> I suggest taking "knows to only bullshit the gullible 1d6."
[22-Jun-2014 22:03:13]  <Rig> Heh.
[22-Jun-2014 22:03:16]  <ponicalica> *snerk*
[22-Jun-2014 22:03:18]  <Rig> Lying is a last resort.
[22-Jun-2014 22:03:25]  <IllFlower> I like that one.
[22-Jun-2014 22:04:03]  <Rig> I think that went well.
[22-Jun-2014 22:04:06]  <ponicalica> it did
[22-Jun-2014 22:04:10]  <IllFlower> I could see it as something like "lie by omission first," haha.
[22-Jun-2014 22:04:22]  <IllFlower> Don't make stuff up unless you have to.
[22-Jun-2014 22:04:36]  <IllFlower> Anyway, that was grand. I think we're all wrapped here.
[22-Jun-2014 22:04:46]  <IllFlower> I'll come up with names for his parents at some point.
[22-Jun-2014 22:04:47]  <Rig> Cool. If you guys continue I’ll read the logs.
[22-Jun-2014 22:04:57]  <Rig> But now I need to go suffer the heat and mow the lawn.
[22-Jun-2014 22:05:08]  <Alicia> Ew.
[22-Jun-2014 22:05:10]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, Rig. See you next time.
[22-Jun-2014 22:05:13]  <Rig> Later.

[22-Jun-2014 22:05:16]  <IllFlower> Don't die of heatstroke.
[22-Jun-2014 22:05:16]  <BGTB2005> I don't see Kazuki using the "we're a friend of X" attempt at gaining entry in the future
[22-Jun-2014 22:05:43]  <IllFlower> All right, in the hour or so I have left, I think we can do Yumiko's last scene and sort out the reflection fallout from last branch.
[22-Jun-2014 22:05:54]  <Alicia> Mkay.
[22-Jun-2014 22:07:00]  <IllFlower> The girls (I can't use that after this, can I?) go to talk to Yumiko. She's busy chatting with someone who appears to be a nurse, some kind of staff the Order has retained to keep an eye on her.
[22-Jun-2014 22:07:06]  <Nitya> 14ha, are the conservator bosses called prophets
[22-Jun-2014 22:07:12]  <ponicalica> they are, yeah
[22-Jun-2014 22:07:48]  <IllFlower> She nods to the Conservators as they enter the room.
[22-Jun-2014 22:08:23]  <IllFlower> Much like Shii, she has a hard time concealing her reaction to Rin's physical state.
[22-Jun-2014 22:08:58]  <IllFlower> Nitya: Basically pulled that unchanged from the original Dogs book, haha.
[22-Jun-2014 22:09:15]  <Nitya> 14mormons mormons errywhere

[22-Jun-2014 22:09:57]  <IllFlower> Magical Mormon... uh, Mutts, I guess.
[22-Jun-2014 22:10:20]  <IllFlower> I dunno if any of you guys want to be the one to say "hi" to Yumiko.
[22-Jun-2014 22:11:20]  <BGTB2005> Rin notices Yumiko's reaction. "I've been through worse."
[22-Jun-2014 22:11:33]  <ponicalica> that's one way to introduce yourself
[22-Jun-2014 22:12:02]  <IllFlower> "Huh..." Yumiko says with a daunted voice.
[22-Jun-2014 22:12:10]  <Alicia> Hikari moves past Rin up to Yumiko's bed. "Hey, there." She greets happily. "How are you, Yumiko?"
[22-Jun-2014 22:12:28]  <IllFlower> "Better than her."
[22-Jun-2014 22:13:04]  <IllFlower> Yumiko says this without a trace of sarcasm.
[22-Jun-2014 22:13:52]  <Alicia> She chuckles. "... true. Well, I'm not sure if you've been informed, but you'll be going under a new familiar soon. Hopefully this is better for you, Yumiko."
[22-Jun-2014 22:14:33]  <ponicalica> "As soon as the transfer goes through, you should be released."
[22-Jun-2014 22:14:43]  <IllFlower> "I'm being transferred?"
[22-Jun-2014 22:15:06]  <BGTB2005> "We found out what the fitness tests are and we told Shii."
[22-Jun-2014 22:15:28]  <IllFlower> "The ones Akase wanted me to do?"
[22-Jun-2014 22:15:32]  <ponicalica> "Those exactly.'
[22-Jun-2014 22:16:14]  <IllFlower> "So I won't have to do them anymore?"
[22-Jun-2014 22:16:47]  <ponicalica> "If you do, contact the Conservators again; that's not supposed to happen."
[22-Jun-2014 22:17:16]  <IllFlower> "I knew it wasn't right...
[22-Jun-2014 22:17:32]  <IllFlower> "But why am I being transferred? Couldn't you just stop the tests?"
[22-Jun-2014 22:17:42]  <BGTB2005> "I tried."
[22-Jun-2014 22:17:55]  <IllFlower> "Oh..."
[22-Jun-2014 22:18:10]  <IllFlower> Yumiko gives Rin another once-over and frowns.
[22-Jun-2014 22:18:25]  <Alicia> "We were unsuccessful and ended up having to report directly to Shii, who took over from there."
[22-Jun-2014 22:19:01]  <IllFlower> "Took over...?"
[22-Jun-2014 22:19:41]  <Alicia> "Well... worked within the Order to make sure nothing like that happens again, essentially."
[22-Jun-2014 22:19:41]  <ponicalica> "Shii's the one who's initiating the transfers now, I think."
[22-Jun-2014 22:20:17]  <IllFlower> Sidestepping the big news, aren't we. :p
[22-Jun-2014 22:20:30]  <Alicia> Maaaybe.
[22-Jun-2014 22:20:40]  <ponicalica> you mean Nyoma's fate, I assume?
[22-Jun-2014 22:20:53]  <IllFlower> "I see." Yumiko nods, though she doesn't seem all that reassured.
[22-Jun-2014 22:21:28]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Mm-hmm.
[22-Jun-2014 22:22:05]  <IllFlower> "Well, thank you," she finally says. "I hope I'll be able to get along with my new familiar's initiates."
[22-Jun-2014 22:22:27]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: I mean, does Yumiko even really care about Nyoma?  I can't quite tell :\
[22-Jun-2014 22:22:57]  <Alicia> Yeah. She was the loner.
[22-Jun-2014 22:23:36]  <ponicalica> .
[22-Jun-2014 22:23:37]  <IllFlower> Well, I mean, the tests are over now that Michi's getting transferred to a more attentive familiar.
[22-Jun-2014 22:25:28]  <ponicalica> "Hopefully you will, and hopefully Michi's new familiar will curb her abuses."
[22-Jun-2014 22:25:45]  <IllFlower> "She's being reassigned too?"
[22-Jun-2014 22:25:58]  <BGTB2005> "Everyone."
[22-Jun-2014 22:26:25]  <IllFlower> "Everyone..." Yumiko nods again, her expression unchanged.
[22-Jun-2014 22:26:35]  <IllFlower> She seems to understand what this means for Nyoma.
[22-Jun-2014 22:27:27]  <IllFlower> "I'm so sorry," she says.
[22-Jun-2014 22:28:13]  <IllFlower> *, to no one in particular.
[22-Jun-2014 22:30:37]  <Alicia> Hikari keeps the smile, trying to be somewhat comforting. "Hopefully you can be with a group you will like, now, at least."
[22-Jun-2014 22:30:59]  <Alicia> "The Order will... make sure that this goes over smoothly, I feel."
[22-Jun-2014 22:31:22]  <Alicia> (Hikari: Don't become a therapist or anything.)
[22-Jun-2014 22:31:31]  <IllFlower> Yumiko looks back at Hikari. "Yeah."
[22-Jun-2014 22:31:35]  <BGTB2005> leave that to Kazuki
[22-Jun-2014 22:33:14]  <IllFlower> lol.
[22-Jun-2014 22:33:32]  <IllFlower> Well, I think we can draw some curtains over this branch.
[22-Jun-2014 22:33:53]  <ponicalica> leaving only the question: what happens next
[22-Jun-2014 22:34:47]  <IllFlower> /hanakana
[22-Jun-2014 22:35:06]  <ponicalica> lol
[22-Jun-2014 22:35:47]  <IllFlower> Let's work on the reflection fallout a bit, shall we?
[22-Jun-2014 22:36:45]  <Alicia> Sure.
[22-Jun-2014 22:36:54]  <BGTB2005> sure
[22-Jun-2014 22:37:38]  <IllFlower> Again, that's page 121 of the manual.
[22-Jun-2014 22:38:20]  <ponicalica> sure
[22-Jun-2014 22:38:43]  <IllFlower> I'mma kick you, ponicalica.
[22-Jun-2014 22:39:21]  <ponicalica> So, as I said earlier, I think the most notable thing Ayako's done this arc is try and fail to stop Rin from pummeling Tsubaki
[22-Jun-2014 22:39:27]  <Alicia> I was thinking that adding a point to Ht would make sense for a potential reflection? She kinda got wiped by Michi and co. and learned the violent way that violence doesn't solve everything. But hm. I'm also considering adding a relationship with Ayako, what with saving her and all. Whether that's with the previous thing, or something else, I dunno.
[22-Jun-2014 22:39:51]  <Alicia> Mostly, the big things for Hikari were the build up/stand off with the other group, then there was all of them talking with Shii.
[22-Jun-2014 22:40:18]  <ponicalica> Well I think there's a "add relationship dice" as one of the relfection fallouts, and then you can assign to Ayako
[22-Jun-2014 22:40:59]  <Alicia> Yep.
[22-Jun-2014 22:41:13]  <IllFlower> Yeah, you can add any two relationship dice, or 2d4 + any one.
[22-Jun-2014 22:41:14]  <BGTB2005> Rin's accomplishments...
[22-Jun-2014 22:41:37]  <IllFlower> Justice!
[22-Jun-2014 22:41:38]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: beating up Tsubaki, breaking up the fitness test, getting beat up by Michi
[22-Jun-2014 22:42:06]  <BGTB2005> also helping keep Yumiko alive
[22-Jun-2014 22:42:19]  <Alicia> By almost beating her up.
[22-Jun-2014 22:42:19]  <ponicalica> ooh, that too
[22-Jun-2014 22:42:40]  <Alicia> Hm what else did Hikari accomplish...
[22-Jun-2014 22:42:52]  <ponicalica> Maybe adding to Wl, since she blocked off Rin? (for Ayako, I mean) I'm not quite sure but who knos
[22-Jun-2014 22:42:56]  <IllFlower> Justice started out swift and got a little less swift as the branch went on.
[22-Jun-2014 22:42:59]  <Alicia> I mean, her "justice" didn't exactly go swimmingly. >_>
[22-Jun-2014 22:43:01]  <BGTB2005> almost getting blown up?
[22-Jun-2014 22:43:29]  <IllFlower> Arbitrarily picking an effect and then beating it into the narrative also works.
[22-Jun-2014 22:44:46]  * BGTB2005 attempts imitating that movie trailer voice
[22-Jun-2014 22:44:55]  <BGTB2005> Two girls with bad experiences involving fire and explosions must team up with a girl all about fire and explosions
[22-Jun-2014 22:45:16]  <IllFlower> Alicia: You can do both Ht++ and a relationship with Ayako, by the way.
[22-Jun-2014 22:45:21]  <Alicia> Hikari doesn't have bad experience with either.
[22-Jun-2014 22:45:26]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Ht++?
[22-Jun-2014 22:45:30]  <ponicalica> Alicia: adding one to
[22-Jun-2014 22:45:30]  <IllFlower> Add one to Ht.
[22-Jun-2014 22:45:35]  <Alicia> Ah.
[22-Jun-2014 22:45:58]  <Alicia> ponicalica: A relationship with Ayako fine with you?
[22-Jun-2014 22:46:05]  <ponicalica> Alicia: yup
[22-Jun-2014 22:46:33]  <Alicia> BGTB2005: Also Hikari hasn't had bad experiences with fires or explosions. Ayako...
[22-Jun-2014 22:46:36]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Cool.
[22-Jun-2014 22:46:36]  <IllFlower> You have a lot of unassigned relationship dice, actually. Maybe it'd be good to go through and assign a couple more of them at some point.
[22-Jun-2014 22:46:55]  <ponicalica> Ayako could probably but bad dice for Rin or something, heh
[22-Jun-2014 22:46:58]  <ponicalica> d4s, I mean
[22-Jun-2014 22:47:16]  <Alicia> Would the time in between the next arc be a good time to go over assigning the relationships, and checking them ith you?
[22-Jun-2014 22:47:16]  <BGTB2005> there was that baseball grenade, but Hikari managed to come out of that relatively unscathed

[22-Jun-2014 22:48:09]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Gotcha. Also, think I'll go with Ht++ and a relationship with Ayako.
[22-Jun-2014 22:48:10]  <ponicalica> has to fight between the whole "the Conservators trust her judgment" and getting fucking punched
[22-Jun-2014 22:48:18]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Well, Rin already has 1d4 for Ayako, so...
[22-Jun-2014 22:48:29]  <BGTB2005> Rin won't punch her teammates unless they get in ehr way
[22-Jun-2014 22:48:34]  <BGTB2005> *her
[22-Jun-2014 22:49:03]  <IllFlower> But before we get too far into things let's talk a bit more about the actual reflection stuff.
[22-Jun-2014 22:49:12]  <ponicalica> Yeah, I think I'll just add a die to Wl as one of 'em
[22-Jun-2014 22:49:30]  <IllFlower> Okay.
[22-Jun-2014 22:51:03]  * IllFlower notices someone else's cursor on "good at singing" dice
[22-Jun-2014 22:51:11]  <Alicia> Not me.
[22-Jun-2014 22:51:16]  <ponicalica> that was an accident, lol
[22-Jun-2014 22:51:20]  <IllFlower> "This arc taught me that maybe we should just sing instead of punching people."
[22-Jun-2014 22:51:39]  <Alicia> Or dance. ;)
[22-Jun-2014 22:51:54]  <Alicia> Just sing, Ayako. That is your strength.
[22-Jun-2014 22:52:12]  <IllFlower> So ponicalica's got one down, otherwise everyone still needs two.
[22-Jun-2014 22:52:32]  <IllFlower> One for Alicia.
[22-Jun-2014 22:53:10]  <BGTB2005> Could I add one more to Wl?
[22-Jun-2014 22:53:19]  <IllFlower> I have a feeling I know which part of "social bonds" Hikari's going to get better at.
[22-Jun-2014 22:53:22]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Yup.
[22-Jun-2014 22:54:05]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Hikari's good at bonding with people once she gets to know them and get over herself.
[22-Jun-2014 22:54:13]  <Alicia> >7 Wl
[22-Jun-2014 22:54:21]  <ponicalica> that's some fucking will
[22-Jun-2014 22:54:29]  <BGTB2005> :3
[22-Jun-2014 22:54:40]  <BGTB2005> never give up, never surrender
[22-Jun-2014 22:54:59]  <BGTB2005> unless the situation's completely unwinnable

[22-Jun-2014 22:55:14]  <Alicia> NEVER GIVE UP
[22-Jun-2014 22:55:16]  <Alicia> NEVER SURRENDER
[22-Jun-2014 22:55:26]  <Alicia> FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT F-F-F-FIGHT.
[22-Jun-2014 22:56:04]  <IllFlower> Alicia: She's good with bonds in general. Though she might need some rope.
[22-Jun-2014 22:56:17]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Hehehe.
[22-Jun-2014 22:56:28]  <Alicia> Hikari's a true socialite, after all.
[22-Jun-2014 22:56:33]  <IllFlower> Okay, folks, one more effect.
[22-Jun-2014 22:56:40]  <ponicalica> hmmm
[22-Jun-2014 22:56:48]  <Alicia> I think I added in the one with Ayako, though, didn't I?
[22-Jun-2014 22:56:54]  <ponicalica> did you add dice for it?
[22-Jun-2014 22:57:01]  <Alicia> 1d6 Ayako?
[22-Jun-2014 22:57:10]  <ponicalica> or did you just use existing dice
[22-Jun-2014 22:57:12]  <IllFlower> If you're going to do that you may as well add another die or 2d4.
[22-Jun-2014 22:57:19]  <IllFlower> Since that's one of the options.
[22-Jun-2014 22:57:30]  <IllFlower> Just stick 'em in with your unassigned dice.
[22-Jun-2014 22:57:42]  <Alicia> So 2d6 or 1d6 +2d4 Ayako?
[22-Jun-2014 22:57:43]  <ponicalica> I called in a die from my existing d4 stash for Rin.

[22-Jun-2014 22:58:42]  <IllFlower> You can elect to do something like 2d6 or even 2d8, though.

[22-Jun-2014 22:59:18]  <Alicia> I'll fill in a 2d8 with Ayako then.
[22-Jun-2014 22:59:43]  <IllFlower> Got some real feelings for her, huh.
[22-Jun-2014 23:00:00]  <ponicalica> I guess Ayako's getting roped in here.
[22-Jun-2014 23:00:10]  <IllFlower> lol.
[22-Jun-2014 23:00:23]  <Alicia> She's a good person with strong moral values. Therefore, definitely worth taking a flaming baseball to the gut for.
[22-Jun-2014 23:00:32]  <Alicia> ("She agrees with me, therefore I like her.")

[22-Jun-2014 23:01:32]  <Alicia> Or I could swap that over to the 2d6 if that works better, then go back to 4d8 and see what I can do with those. xD

[22-Jun-2014 23:01:59]  <IllFlower> You can have relationships with sins. Interesting prospect for some of your characters...
[22-Jun-2014 23:01:59]  <ponicalica> Well, which one do you think works
[22-Jun-2014 23:02:27]  <Alicia> I'll go ith the 2d6.
[22-Jun-2014 23:02:38]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Oh huh. Forgot about that.
[22-Jun-2014 23:02:50]  <IllFlower> (Rin goes for "Wrath 6d6")
[22-Jun-2014 23:03:17]  <BGTB2005> Almost tempted to add a d6 to "If it doesn't work, use more" since she clearly didn't use enough in the last fight
[22-Jun-2014 23:03:40]  <IllFlower> On the other hand, it didn't work. ;)
[22-Jun-2014 23:03:49]  <Alicia> It got her hurt more.
[22-Jun-2014 23:03:52]  <ponicalica> You could make it d4s and turn it into a disadvantage
[22-Jun-2014 23:04:15]  <BGTB2005> well she didn't use enough then
[22-Jun-2014 23:05:12]  <BGTB2005> I guess I'll throw some extra dice at the relationship pool
[22-Jun-2014 23:05:28]  <Alicia> Do I need to add anything else or is Hikari reflectioned up.
[22-Jun-2014 23:05:38]  <ponicalica> did you do two things?
[22-Jun-2014 23:05:48]  <Alicia> Yes.
[22-Jun-2014 23:06:25]  <BGTB2005> added 2d4 plus a d6 to my unused relationship dice pool
[22-Jun-2014 23:06:32]  <IllFlower> Cool
[22-Jun-2014 23:06:39]  <IllFlower> . ponicalica, just one more from you, then.
[22-Jun-2014 23:06:43]  <ponicalica> yup
[22-Jun-2014 23:07:55]  <ponicalica> Not sure what to do.  Do Alicia or BGTB2005 have ideas?
[22-Jun-2014 23:08:03]  <BGTB2005> add a relationship?
[22-Jun-2014 23:08:22]  <Alicia> "Relationships Blood 1d6" Nice.
[22-Jun-2014 23:08:23]  <BGTB2005> add a die to "Doesn't run from violence"?
[22-Jun-2014 23:08:57]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: Reasoning for that?
[22-Jun-2014 23:09:03]  <Alicia> I dunno, maybe you could add 1d6 "Can work with teams (finally)"
[22-Jun-2014 23:09:16]  <Alicia> She helped Hikari, albeit on the reasoning of "Fuck that girl."
[22-Jun-2014 23:09:28]  <IllFlower> I think she was the least willing to stick around for the violence out of all of your characters, haha.
[22-Jun-2014 23:09:51]  <ponicalica> this arc, yeah, whoops
[22-Jun-2014 23:09:52]  <ponicalica> haha
[22-Jun-2014 23:10:10]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Ideas for Ayako?
[22-Jun-2014 23:10:16]  <IllFlower> If this were last arc, I'd suggest bumping up Bd, but this isn't last arc.
[22-Jun-2014 23:10:44]  <ponicalica> She helped Yumiko.  Maybe add something wrt that?
[22-Jun-2014 23:10:47]  <Alicia> Oh wait, misread who had remaining dice.
[22-Jun-2014 23:10:59]  <IllFlower> She could add a relationship.
[22-Jun-2014 23:11:06]  <IllFlower> Or you could.
[22-Jun-2014 23:11:09]  <ponicalica> (1d6 tea and cookies aficionado")
[22-Jun-2014 23:11:25]  <BGTB2005> man I should've done that
[22-Jun-2014 23:11:30]  <IllFlower> I mean, who knows? Maybe she'll be back later and that relationship will come in handy.
[22-Jun-2014 23:11:32]  <Alicia> You still can!!1
[22-Jun-2014 23:12:02]  <ponicalica> Hmm, yeah
[22-Jun-2014 23:12:42]  <ponicalica> add a d6 or d8 for it and then another die like that in unassigned?
[22-Jun-2014 23:12:51]  <IllFlower> Sure.
[22-Jun-2014 23:12:53]  *** Nitya <~Glossina@216-161-89-199.ptld.qwest.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 190 seconds)
[22-Jun-2014 23:13:57]  <ponicalica> maybe a d6 for her and a d8 unassigned?
[22-Jun-2014 23:14:30]  *** Nitya <~Glossina@67-5-253-116.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[22-Jun-2014 23:15:17]  <ponicalica> done
[22-Jun-2014 23:15:38]  <IllFlower> All right. That's everything!
[22-Jun-2014 23:16:08]  <IllFlower> There's a good chance we won't be having a session next weekend, but I'll let you know how things go.
[22-Jun-2014 23:16:13]  <Alicia> I gotcha.
[22-Jun-2014 23:16:19]  <ponicalica> I dunno if I'll be able to either
[22-Jun-2014 23:16:19]  <IllFlower> Thanks again, everyone. Look forward to new despair next time.
