@time=2014-10-26T19:09:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Last we saw our heroes, they had just talked to Asacchi about her problems with that Karasuma guy.
@time=2014-10-26T19:10:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, and I guess there was that thing about that girl that Hikari knows who knew Jun.
@time=2014-10-26T19:11:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And I believe the group had decided on staking out the school where Karasuma goes?
@time=2014-10-26T19:11:29.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think so
@time=2014-10-26T19:11:32.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes.
@time=2014-10-26T19:11:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Indeed. Is that still the direction we're going in?

@time=2014-10-26T19:14:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Karasuma's school is kind of awkwardly wedged into an oblong plot of land between packed-together houses.

@time=2014-10-26T19:15:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's still the middle of the day, and while many of the students have cleared out, there are still clubs here and there staging practice or having meetings.

@time=2014-10-26T19:23:16.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe Ayako and Hikari are watching around the area below him inside?
@time=2014-10-26T19:23:24.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Acting like students, or some crap.

@time=2014-10-26T19:28:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki and Hikari are camped across the street from the main school entrance, waiting for Rin and Ayako to spot the target. Kazuki takes the opportunity to pose some questions to Hikari.

@time=2014-10-26T19:28:39.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hikari, could I ask you something?"
@time=2014-10-26T19:31:06.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari takes a break from her intense surveillance to change focus. "Yes, you may. What is it, Kazuki?"

@time=2014-10-26T19:35:42.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Figuring that Miho was going to be the subject, Hikari idly touches the binoculars while thinking of an answer. "We... have something of a history, her being Junpei's sister, and all."
@time=2014-10-26T19:36:41.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"My best friend. Known each other for years, though he's off somewhere else now," she quickly clarifies. "Miho... was also a Conservator, though I'm sure you figured as much out by now."

@time=2014-10-26T19:42:19.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki nods and looks up to see if he can spot Rin. He wonders if he should talk to Miho himself. Maybe Hikari's friendship kept the truth hidden a bit.
@time=2014-10-26T19:43:11.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari sighs. "I'm sorry, Kazuki, but I feel inclined to ask. Why are you asking? This is... unusual, even if expected." She asks, before returning to a half-hearted surveillance.

@time=2014-10-26T19:48:47.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari snickers, her frown  disappearing briefly. "No, we... really are. I haven't been oblivious to the fact." She goes silent for a bit, contemplating an answer. "Then might I please ask, what do you have in mind for Karasuma?"
