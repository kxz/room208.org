[03-May-2014 20:04:52]  <IllFlower> Everyone ready?
[03-May-2014 20:05:08]  <Alicia> Here and ready.
[03-May-2014 20:05:11]  <BGTB2005> more or less
[03-May-2014 20:05:31]  <BGTB2005> er, wait, tracking down my cat
[03-May-2014 20:05:48]  <ponicalica> here and ready
[03-May-2014 20:05:54]  <IllFlower> Rin's actually the cat's character.
[03-May-2014 20:05:58]  *** Barcode <~Barcode@dhcp-c8-d7-19-26-33-7c.cpe.sourcecable.net> has left #madokamadness
[03-May-2014 20:06:01]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005 does all the typing.
[03-May-2014 20:06:35]  <IllFlower> "I raise 6--" "Meow meow mrrow!" "Sorry, *8*..."
[03-May-2014 20:07:24]  <IllFlower> "Meow meow, meow, meow meow meow!" "Yeah, well, at least God gave me fingers."
[03-May-2014 20:07:24]  <Alicia> Lol.
[03-May-2014 20:07:59]  <Buttercupistiny> excellent
[03-May-2014 20:08:34]  <IllFlower> Anyway, last time, we left off with Yumiko going into the custody of the Conservators.
[03-May-2014 20:09:01]  <IllFlower> I got the impression you all wanted to sit her down and ask some questions...
[03-May-2014 20:09:12]  <ponicalica> yeah
[03-May-2014 20:09:36]  <BGTB2005> can't find my cat; hopefully she's outside and I simply forgot
[03-May-2014 20:10:18]  <IllFlower> Let's set the scene, then.
[03-May-2014 20:10:54]  <IllFlower> The girls have reported back to the abandoned church Shii calls home, Yumiko in tow.
[03-May-2014 20:11:36]  <BGTB2005> ((found my cat))
[03-May-2014 20:12:08]  <IllFlower> The familiar greets them on the way in. Glancing at the small lacerations on Yumiko's body, she says, "I trust there wasn't too much trouble?"
[03-May-2014 20:12:41]  <ponicalica> "She tried to kill herself.  We stopped her.  Our new partner's wings seem rather useful..."
[03-May-2014 20:14:30]  <IllFlower> Shii gives Ayako a serious look, then waves her over with a gesture suggesting that she wants the two of them to talk alone for a moment.
[03-May-2014 20:15:02]  <ponicalica> Ayako acknowledges the gesture, and then starts to walk over to Shii...
[03-May-2014 20:15:12]  <IllFlower> "She tried to kill herself?" Shii whispers to Ayako. "To escape capture?"
[03-May-2014 20:16:19]  <ponicalica> "She did.  «Even the Conservators think I'm gone...» was what she said."
[03-May-2014 20:18:00]  <IllFlower> "Two things come to mind," Shii says, with a complicated expression on her face.
[03-May-2014 20:18:05]  <IllFlower> The first is that, if what you're saying is true, she might be hiding something she'd rather give up her life for than divulge to us.
[03-May-2014 20:19:07]  <IllFlower> "The second follows from the first. There's a chance she may make another attempt. I'm sure I don't need to say this, but you need to make absolutely sure she doesn't."
[03-May-2014 20:20:00]  <ponicalica> "Got it.  I should tell this to Hikari and Rin, yeah?"
[03-May-2014 20:20:49]  <ponicalica> "Oh, and do you have any idea what it could be that she's hiding?"
[03-May-2014 20:22:17]  <IllFlower> "Yes, but be careful what you say when Kayano's present. We already have evidence that her behavior can be rather volatile. As for what she could be hiding, you'd have to find out the girl herself, or someone who knows her. They just give me the assignments."
[03-May-2014 20:24:39]  <ponicalica> Ayako acknowledges Shii's statements, then walks back to the main group.
[03-May-2014 20:25:59]  <IllFlower> Yumiko continues to look at the ground from her position slumped over Hikari's shoulder.
[03-May-2014 20:27:53]  <Alicia> Hikari looks at Ayako curiously. "So Ayako, what were you talking with Shii about?"
[03-May-2014 20:28:18]  <Alicia> ("Crap.")
[03-May-2014 20:28:18]  <ponicalica> Ayako whispers a few things about the situation to Hikari, then turns to do the same to Rin.
[03-May-2014 20:29:15]  <ponicalica> She then turns to Yumiko.  "So Yumiko, when did the flares begin to happen?"
[03-May-2014 20:30:39]  <IllFlower> Going straight for the jugular, are we?
[03-May-2014 20:30:58]  <ponicalica> may...be?
[03-May-2014 20:31:26]  <ponicalica> Nobody here's all that good at talking to people.  They picked the wrong team to pick her up.
[03-May-2014 20:32:35]  <IllFlower> Yumiko grimaces. "Can I have some water?" she asks, ignoring Ayako's question.
[03-May-2014 20:35:08]  <ponicalica> "Hikari, you brought bottled water with you, right?  Can you hand Yumiko one?"
[03-May-2014 20:36:48]  <Alicia> Hikari nods, quickly handing a bottle to Yumiko. "Now can you naswer the question, please?"
[03-May-2014 20:36:59]  <IllFlower> Bottled water, brass knuckles, handcuffs... Hikari's got everything, eh?
[03-May-2014 20:37:19]  <Alicia> Ya gotta be prepared, flower. Ya gotta be prepared.
[03-May-2014 20:38:50]  <IllFlower> Yumiko gingerly brings the bottle to her mouth, then proceeds to down about half of it.
[03-May-2014 20:39:17]  <IllFlower> Stray water spills in rivulets down her chin.
[03-May-2014 20:39:29]  <IllFlower> She hands the bottle back to Hikari.
[03-May-2014 20:40:32]  <IllFlower> Her breath ragged, she resumes silently staring at a point on the ground about a meter in front of her.
[03-May-2014 20:42:48]  <IllFlower> If you want her to start talking, you'll probably have to initiate conflict.
[03-May-2014 20:43:11]  <IllFlower> It's pretty clear she's not all there at the moment.
[03-May-2014 20:43:25]  <Alicia> Hikari looks pointedly at Yumiko. "Yumiko. We will wait as long as we have to, or force an answer out if we must. Can you please answer Ayako?"
[03-May-2014 20:43:40]  <ponicalica> Alicia: i think that might be a raise?
[03-May-2014 20:43:53]  <ponicalica> at any rate, we'd need stakes
[03-May-2014 20:44:07]  <Alicia> Oh, I was trying to continue this, but I typed a bit late. ;v
[03-May-2014 20:44:08]  <Alicia> :v*
[03-May-2014 20:44:44]  <ponicalica> but yeah, I think I'd be for a conflict.  BGTB2005?
[03-May-2014 20:44:49]  <Alicia> Stakes? Potentially damning information? Her continued well-being?
[03-May-2014 20:44:59]  <IllFlower> The principle is that I either say yes or roll the dice. Clearly, I've stopped saying "yes," so... :p
[03-May-2014 20:45:01]  <Alicia> For a loose definition of well-being.
[03-May-2014 20:45:19]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Yes. :p
[03-May-2014 20:45:20]  <IllFlower> What, are you going to torture her? Yeesh, man.
[03-May-2014 20:45:53]  <BGTB2005> that's probably not going to yield anything useful anyways
[03-May-2014 20:46:04]  <ponicalica> Stakes I guess would be the information regarding her flares, I dunno if this is too broad though
[03-May-2014 20:46:06]  <BGTB2005> maybe a chat over tea and cookies?
[03-May-2014 20:46:27]  <IllFlower> Tea and cookies can be arranged.
[03-May-2014 20:46:52]  <IllFlower> There might still be a conflict there, but at least it'd involve less violence.
[03-May-2014 20:47:16]  <Alicia> IllFlower: No, I meant like she's not exactly in good spirits, so we'd need to not force an answer out too harshly.
[03-May-2014 20:47:29]  <ponicalica> Rin quickly heads over to the convenience store and purchases tea and cookies.  Raise 25.
[03-May-2014 20:47:33]  <IllFlower> That's not what that sounds like!
[03-May-2014 20:47:33]  <Alicia> I'm not up for *hurting* the girl. `-`
[03-May-2014 20:47:44]  <Alicia> Yeah fair enough, I should've elaborated.
[03-May-2014 20:48:44]  <IllFlower> I do need the general contours of what you'd want from a conflict, though.
[03-May-2014 20:49:40]  <IllFlower> Maybe getting her to trust the Conservators enough to talk would be a start.
[03-May-2014 20:50:22]  <Alicia> The stakes being her opening up to us sounds good to me, personally.
[03-May-2014 20:50:35]  <ponicalica> Yeah, that sounds good.  Social conflict, I assume?
[03-May-2014 20:51:26]  <IllFlower> Unless you really are planning on beating her up, yes.
[03-May-2014 20:51:53]  <IllFlower> You can play the conflict out over the course of hours or days, as a reminder.

[03-May-2014 20:53:56]  <IllFlower> One of you should raise.
[03-May-2014 20:54:05]  <ponicalica> I think Alicia had a raise?
[03-May-2014 20:54:42]  <BGTB2005> Alicia has more fours than i do
[03-May-2014 20:55:01]  <Alicia> And ponny has more than me. :p
[03-May-2014 20:55:29]  <ponicalica> it's high die is what matters, lol
[03-May-2014 20:55:35]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[03-May-2014 20:55:46]  <ponicalica> but I also meant that Hikari had something she wanted to say, I think?  Unless that doesn't make sense anymore.
[03-May-2014 20:56:02]  <Alicia> I think it'd still apply.
[03-May-2014 20:56:12]  <Alicia> @dice use 6 4

[03-May-2014 20:57:50]  <IllFlower> All right. Yumiko's vacant gaze doesn't shift one iota.
[03-May-2014 20:57:55]  <IllFlower> @dice use 5 5

[03-May-2014 20:58:08]  <Alicia> Hikari looks at Yumiko. "Listen, we will wait as long as we have to. Please, answer Ayako."
[03-May-2014 20:58:13]  <Alicia> (Yeah yeah 2slow. ><)
[03-May-2014 20:58:54]  <IllFlower> Done. BGTB2005, I'm arbitrarily going to say you're up next, then ponicalica afterward.
[03-May-2014 20:59:21]  <IllFlower> Oh, I forgot to roll the die for Yumiko's relationship with the Conservators...
[03-May-2014 20:59:24]  <IllFlower> @dice add d4
[03-May-2014 20:59:24]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 1 = 1. Bank now has 1 1 4 4 4 4 = 18.
[03-May-2014 20:59:30]  <IllFlower> Awesome.
[03-May-2014 20:59:52]  <Alicia> Lel.
[03-May-2014 20:59:57]  <BGTB2005> pffff
[03-May-2014 21:00:06]  <ponicalica> gj
[03-May-2014 21:00:24]  <BGTB2005> at least punches and/or spells aren't being thrown
[03-May-2014 21:00:51]  <Alicia> That's always good. Kinda.
[03-May-2014 21:01:23]  <Nitya> 1,1conflict ends, alicia loses, alicia's character grows a pocket protector and is sentenced to isolation
[03-May-2014 21:01:38]  <IllFlower> As I mentioned, I'm always up for raises involving tea and cookies.
[03-May-2014 21:02:44]  <ponicalica> I approve of the tea and cookies idea
[03-May-2014 21:02:57]  <Alicia> Likewise.

[03-May-2014 21:11:09]  <ponicalica> Ayako heads over to the nearest convenience store, and purchases some tea and cookies.  "We're here to help.  We'd like to fix what's wrong with you, but we can't do that unless we know what caused it."

[03-May-2014 21:17:17]  <IllFlower> That evening, the Conservators show Yumiko to a simply-furnished room in the church, laid out for her to spend the night there. The girls take turns on duty to make sure she's not up to anything.

[03-May-2014 21:28:12]  <BGTB2005> attempting to investigate the sound could work?
[03-May-2014 21:28:34]  <IllFlower> If you could shut it up, that'd be great.

[03-May-2014 21:33:18]  <ponicalica> Ayako's said all she can really think to say to Yumiko to reassure--she's not good at reassuring--so she provides breakfast instead.

[03-May-2014 21:34:41]  <IllFlower> Bribing the girl with food, are we.
[03-May-2014 21:34:48]  <IllFlower> Well, I have no dice left, so that's that.
[03-May-2014 21:35:00]  <Buttercupistiny> it works for him when he has to deal with me, so
[03-May-2014 21:35:36]  <BGTB2005> everybody loves food
[03-May-2014 21:35:51]  <Alicia> The girl has to eat.
[03-May-2014 21:35:59]  <IllFlower> Yumiko pokes at the rice Ayako prepared, looking at her from across the table in the church's kitchen.
[03-May-2014 21:36:21]  <IllFlower> "I'm sorry about yesterday," she finally says, haltingly.
[03-May-2014 21:37:16]  <ponicalica> "It's okay.  We're just here to help you right now."
[03-May-2014 21:37:55]  <IllFlower> "Nobody's done something like this for me in a long time."
[03-May-2014 21:38:40]  <IllFlower> She looks down at her food. "They've all just treated me like something's wrong with me, ever since I got here. I wish I knew why."
[03-May-2014 21:41:21]  <ponicalica> "Something wrong with you?  Is this the flares or something else?"
[03-May-2014 21:42:49]  <IllFlower> "Everything. The other girls avoid me. Even Nyoma doesn't seem to think I can do my job any more."
[03-May-2014 21:45:20]  <ponicalica> Ayako begins awkwardly explaining some of the magical theory behind flares.  "...so they are fixable.  But usually they're caused by some underlying stress."
[03-May-2014 21:46:03]  <IllFlower> Yumiko looks at Ayako with some concern. "Are you okay?"
[03-May-2014 21:46:54]  <ponicalica> so is she just completely unaware :V
[03-May-2014 21:47:09]  <ponicalica> clearly Hikari or Rin should start talking.
[03-May-2014 21:47:22]  <BGTB2005> D:
[03-May-2014 21:47:27]  <IllFlower> I dunno, it sounded like Ayako had just kinda started muttering to herself.
[03-May-2014 21:47:49]  <ponicalica> I think she was trying to explain it to Yumiko, she's just an awkward nerd.  :P
[03-May-2014 21:48:05]  <IllFlower> Then "are you okay?" is a perfectly valid response!
[03-May-2014 21:48:29]  <ponicalica> "Uh, yeah, I just get carried away when talking about these things, sorry."
[03-May-2014 21:49:04]  <Alicia> (Yes, have the only girl without personal magic chime in on a magical subject.)
[03-May-2014 21:49:29]  <IllFlower> Might want to ask about how long she's been "here," it occurs to me.
[03-May-2014 21:50:21]  <ponicalica> do Hikari or Rin want to ask something now that Ayako's embarrassed herself?
[03-May-2014 21:50:43]  <IllFlower> They were there the whole time?! :o
[03-May-2014 21:51:09]  <Alicia> (Yeah I wasn't sure when to come in? I mean, Ayako's the one she's on okay terms with.)
[03-May-2014 21:51:21]  <IllFlower> Surely Ayako can recover from this little awkward lull.
[03-May-2014 21:51:45]  <ponicalica> Oh, they weren't there.  Whoops.
[03-May-2014 21:52:08]  <IllFlower> Oh, well, I mean, there's no reason they couldn't have been. I was just having some fun.
[03-May-2014 21:52:13]  <BGTB2005> I think it might depend on how much food Ayako made
[03-May-2014 21:52:40]  <ponicalica> Presumably she made enough for all of y'all.
[03-May-2014 21:52:41]  <IllFlower> Anyway, coughcoughhintabovecough.
[03-May-2014 21:53:37]  <ponicalica> "...at any rate.  You mention «since I got here».  Did you move here recently?"
[03-May-2014 21:54:47]  <IllFlower> Yumiko fidgets for a moment before answering. "Yeah. About four months ago. I lived in Kobe before.
[03-May-2014 21:55:14]  <IllFlower> "I've been a magical girl for longer. About three years. Just not here."

[03-May-2014 22:12:45]  <IllFlower> The girls leave Yumiko in the care of another initiate, and head off to talk to Nyoma.
[03-May-2014 22:14:11]  <IllFlower> It's another bright morning, the midday sun panning back and forth through the train's windows.
[03-May-2014 22:14:39]  <IllFlower> Nyoma's base is, a little strangely, a children's playground across from an elementary school.
[03-May-2014 22:15:38]  <IllFlower> He resembles a strange hybrid of a squirrel and a black cat.
[03-May-2014 22:16:05]  <ponicalica> of course, bystanders will just see three teenage girls just standing in the middle of a playground talking to themselves

[03-May-2014 23:00:51]  <IllFlower> As the girls prepare to say their farewells to Nyoma, a boy's voice comes up from behind them.
[03-May-2014 23:01:19]  <IllFlower> "Yo, Nyoma. Three girls today? As popular as always, huh?"
[03-May-2014 23:03:07]  <IllFlower> The boy walks past the Conservators, chewing a lollipop stick with his hands behind his head as if he's relaxing on a beach chair.

[03-May-2014 23:04:11]  <Alicia> Hikari raises an eyebrow, before smiling quickly. "Yes, we've come to meet Nyoma for some business. And you would be...?"
[03-May-2014 23:05:10]  <IllFlower> "Ah, my bad. Of course, I should introduce myself. Wataru Tsukumo."
[03-May-2014 23:05:44]  <IllFlower> He extends a hand towards Hikari, before noticing the crest on her costume.
[03-May-2014 23:06:20]  <Alicia> "Pleased to meet you, Tsukumo." She extends her hand in kind.
[03-May-2014 23:06:22]  <IllFlower> "Conservators? Hey, Nyoma, you didn't get involved in some shady business, did you?"
[03-May-2014 23:06:50]  <BGTB2005> brb, dinner
[03-May-2014 23:06:57]  <IllFlower> "They're here about Yumiko," Nyoma says. "I was just about to send them to talk to Michi."
[03-May-2014 23:07:20]  <ponicalica> hmm, if it's dinner, should we wrap up?
[03-May-2014 23:07:39]  <IllFlower> I'm not quite done with this scene yet.
[03-May-2014 23:07:44]  <ponicalica> right
[03-May-2014 23:07:56]  <BGTB2005> back
[03-May-2014 23:08:05]  <IllFlower> wat
[03-May-2014 23:08:19]  <BGTB2005> I have my food next to my keyboard
[03-May-2014 23:08:51]  <IllFlower> "Isn't that kind of thing supposed to be your responsibility?" Wataru asks nonchalantly.
[03-May-2014 23:09:11]  <IllFlower> "You know she knows the girls better than I do."
[03-May-2014 23:09:40]  <IllFlower> "Eh, I guess you're the familiar. Your call."
[03-May-2014 23:10:16]  <IllFlower> Wataru looks at Hikari and gives his head a quick jerk to the side, as if he wants to talk with her alone.
[03-May-2014 23:11:47]  <Alicia> Hikari drops her hand and follows Wataru. "Is something concerning you, Tsukumo?"
[03-May-2014 23:12:03]  <IllFlower> "You mind if I borrow her for a moment?" Wataru asks Nyoma. "She seems like my type."
[03-May-2014 23:12:17]  <IllFlower> Without waiting for a response, he turns to Hikari and drops his voice.
[03-May-2014 23:12:32]  <IllFlower> "I'd be careful around Michi if I were you."
[03-May-2014 23:13:04]  <Alicia> Concern draws across her face. "And why do you say that?"
[03-May-2014 23:17:17]  <IllFlower> Wataru makes an annoyed face. "Nyoma's too soft in the head to realize this, but Michi's as two-faced as they come. She's got him wrapped around her finger, but I've seen her around the other girls.

[03-May-2014 23:27:56]  <IllFlower> "Sure. Just remember what I said.
[03-May-2014 23:29:30]  <IllFlower> "Oh, by the way, I meant that whole 'my type' thing as a joke, but now that I look at you, you're actually pretty cute. Just thought I'd throw that out there.
[03-May-2014 23:29:56]  <IllFlower> "Anyway, I should get my business with the old man sorted out. Maybe I'll see you soon."
[03-May-2014 23:30:47]  <Alicia> "Will d-" Hikari pauses. "... I. Thank you, 
[03-May-2014 23:30:58]  <Alicia> " she says quickly, smiling.
[03-May-2014 23:31:32]  <ponicalica> hikari got fliiiiiirted with~
[03-May-2014 23:32:00]  <Alicia> "And until later." Hikari quickly heads back to Ayako and Rin, relaying the information in a group.
[03-May-2014 23:32:41]  <IllFlower> ("Hikari, are you okay? Your face is all red.")
[03-May-2014 23:33:23]  <Alicia> ("It's just the sun, it's pretty hot out.")
[03-May-2014 23:34:40]  <BGTB2005> (I'm guessing Hikari mentioned Michi's role and the other 'tormentors'?)
[03-May-2014 23:34:55]  <Alicia> (Yup.)
[03-May-2014 23:35:28]  <ponicalica> (Did she wait until we were out of Nyoma's way?)
[03-May-2014 23:35:43]  <IllFlower> I figure we're a little overdue on having boyfriends in this campaign that aren't dead.
[03-May-2014 23:36:03]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Nyoma's too busy with Wataru (and also too much like an old man) to notice.
[03-May-2014 23:36:05]  <Alicia> (Well yeah, presumably while we're walking in a group or something. Hikari woudl be careful!)
[03-May-2014 23:38:09]  <IllFlower> Any reactions?
[03-May-2014 23:38:20]  <BGTB2005> "I will crush them," Rin snarled
[03-May-2014 23:38:58]  <IllFlower> , suddenly channeling Nikita Khrushchev.
[03-May-2014 23:39:17]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: shoe and all, I assume?
[03-May-2014 23:39:34]  <Alicia> "Rin... we'd best wait it out, at least. The higher ups girls are certainly a concern, but we *are* here to get information on Yumiko."
[03-May-2014 23:40:17]  <ponicalica> "We should definitely be careful, though.  Bullying could cause issues like this, and if Michi's responsible, seeing Conservators discuss the issue could make her dangerous."
[03-May-2014 23:40:47]  <Alicia> Hikari looks around aimlessly. "Though they are definitely a concern, yes."
[03-May-2014 23:42:36]  <IllFlower> It might be best not to clue Michi into what Wataru's said. /captobvious
[03-May-2014 23:42:49]  <Alicia> Well, certainly.
[03-May-2014 23:43:13]  <IllFlower> If there's nothing else, we can go ahead and wrap up, and pick up with Michi next week.
[03-May-2014 23:43:18]  <ponicalica> Well, if Michi's aware that she's bullying, and that it can cause instability, etc.
[03-May-2014 23:43:25]  <ponicalica> But yeah, I think I'm ready to wrap up.
[03-May-2014 23:43:59]  <Alicia> I'm all good.
[03-May-2014 23:44:39]  <BGTB2005> same here
[03-May-2014 23:45:23]  <IllFlower> Cool. Then I'll call it here for today. Thanks again, everyone!
