@time=2014-05-03T20:07:59.000Z :Buttercupistiny PRIVMSG #madokamadness :excellent
@time=2014-05-03T20:08:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, last time, we left off with Yumiko going into the custody of the Conservators.
@time=2014-05-03T20:09:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I got the impression you all wanted to sit her down and ask some questions...
@time=2014-05-03T20:09:12.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-05-03T20:09:36.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :can't find my cat; hopefully she's outside and I simply forgot
@time=2014-05-03T20:10:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let's set the scene, then.
@time=2014-05-03T20:10:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The girls have reported back to the abandoned church Shii calls home, Yumiko in tow.
@time=2014-05-03T20:11:36.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :((found my cat))
@time=2014-05-03T20:12:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The familiar greets them on the way in. Glancing at the small lacerations on Yumiko's body, she says, "I trust there wasn't too much trouble?"
@time=2014-05-03T20:12:41.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She tried to kill herself.  We stopped her.  Our new partner's wings seem rather useful..."
@time=2014-05-03T20:14:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii gives Ayako a serious look, then waves her over with a gesture suggesting that she wants the two of them to talk alone for a moment.
@time=2014-05-03T20:15:02.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako acknowledges the gesture, and then starts to walk over to Shii...
@time=2014-05-03T20:15:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She tried to kill herself?" Shii whispers to Ayako. "To escape capture?"
@time=2014-05-03T20:16:19.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She did.  «Even the Conservators think I'm gone...» was what she said."
@time=2014-05-03T20:18:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Two things come to mind," Shii says, with a complicated expression on her face.
@time=2014-05-03T20:18:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The first is that, if what you're saying is true, she might be hiding something she'd rather give up her life for than divulge to us.
@time=2014-05-03T20:19:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The second follows from the first. There's a chance she may make another attempt. I'm sure I don't need to say this, but you need to make absolutely sure she doesn't."
@time=2014-05-03T20:20:00.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Got it.  I should tell this to Hikari and Rin, yeah?"
@time=2014-05-03T20:20:49.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Oh, and do you have any idea what it could be that she's hiding?"
@time=2014-05-03T20:22:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yes, but be careful what you say when Kayano's present. We already have evidence that her behavior can be rather volatile. As for what she could be hiding, you'd have to find out the girl herself, or someone who knows her. They just give me the assignments."
@time=2014-05-03T20:24:39.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako acknowledges Shii's statements, then walks back to the main group.
@time=2014-05-03T20:25:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yumiko continues to look at the ground from her position slumped over Hikari's shoulder.
@time=2014-05-03T20:27:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari looks at Ayako curiously. "So Ayako, what were you talking with Shii about?"
@time=2014-05-03T20:28:18.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("Crap.")
@time=2014-05-03T20:28:18.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako whispers a few things about the situation to Hikari, then turns to do the same to Rin.
@time=2014-05-03T20:29:15.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She then turns to Yumiko.  "So Yumiko, when did the flares begin to happen?"
@time=2014-05-03T20:30:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Going straight for the jugular, are we?
@time=2014-05-03T20:30:58.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :may...be?
@time=2014-05-03T20:31:26.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Nobody here's all that good at talking to people.  They picked the wrong team to pick her up.
@time=2014-05-03T20:32:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yumiko grimaces. "Can I have some water?" she asks, ignoring Ayako's question.
@time=2014-05-03T20:35:08.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hikari, you brought bottled water with you, right?  Can you hand Yumiko one?"
@time=2014-05-03T20:36:48.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari nods, quickly handing a bottle to Yumiko. "Now can you naswer the question, please?"
@time=2014-05-03T20:36:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Bottled water, brass knuckles, handcuffs... Hikari's got everything, eh?
@time=2014-05-03T20:37:19.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ya gotta be prepared, flower. Ya gotta be prepared.
@time=2014-05-03T20:38:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yumiko gingerly brings the bottle to her mouth, then proceeds to down about half of it.
@time=2014-05-03T20:39:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Stray water spills in rivulets down her chin.
@time=2014-05-03T20:39:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She hands the bottle back to Hikari.
@time=2014-05-03T20:40:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Her breath ragged, she resumes silently staring at a point on the ground about a meter in front of her.
@time=2014-05-03T20:42:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :If you want her to start talking, you'll probably have to initiate conflict.
@time=2014-05-03T20:43:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's pretty clear she's not all there at the moment.
@time=2014-05-03T20:43:25.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari looks pointedly at Yumiko. "Yumiko. We will wait as long as we have to, or force an answer out if we must. Can you please answer Ayako?"
@time=2014-05-03T20:43:40.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: i think that might be a raise?
@time=2014-05-03T20:43:53.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :at any rate, we'd need stakes
@time=2014-05-03T20:44:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, I was trying to continue this, but I typed a bit late. ;v
@time=2014-05-03T20:44:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness ::v*
@time=2014-05-03T20:44:44.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but yeah, I think I'd be for a conflict.  BGTB2005?
@time=2014-05-03T20:44:49.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Stakes? Potentially damning information? Her continued well-being?
@time=2014-05-03T20:44:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The principle is that I either say yes or roll the dice. Clearly, I've stopped saying "yes," so... :p
@time=2014-05-03T20:45:01.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :For a loose definition of well-being.
@time=2014-05-03T20:45:19.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: Yes. :p
@time=2014-05-03T20:45:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What, are you going to torture her? Yeesh, man.
@time=2014-05-03T20:45:53.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :that's probably not going to yield anything useful anyways
@time=2014-05-03T20:46:04.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Stakes I guess would be the information regarding her flares, I dunno if this is too broad though
@time=2014-05-03T20:46:06.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :maybe a chat over tea and cookies?
@time=2014-05-03T20:46:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Tea and cookies can be arranged.
@time=2014-05-03T20:46:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There might still be a conflict there, but at least it'd involve less violence.
@time=2014-05-03T20:47:16.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: No, I meant like she's not exactly in good spirits, so we'd need to not force an answer out too harshly.
@time=2014-05-03T20:47:29.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin quickly heads over to the convenience store and purchases tea and cookies.  Raise 25.
@time=2014-05-03T20:47:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's not what that sounds like!
@time=2014-05-03T20:47:33.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm not up for *hurting* the girl. `-`
@time=2014-05-03T20:47:44.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah fair enough, I should've elaborated.
@time=2014-05-03T20:48:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I do need the general contours of what you'd want from a conflict, though.
@time=2014-05-03T20:49:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe getting her to trust the Conservators enough to talk would be a start.
@time=2014-05-03T20:50:22.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The stakes being her opening up to us sounds good to me, personally.
@time=2014-05-03T20:50:35.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that sounds good.  Social conflict, I assume?
@time=2014-05-03T20:51:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Unless you really are planning on beating her up, yes.
@time=2014-05-03T20:51:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You can play the conflict out over the course of hours or days, as a reminder.
