[04-Jan-2014 19:59:03]  <IllFlower> character creation materials start on page 22 of the manual.
[04-Jan-2014 19:59:26]  <IllFlower> as it says, the first thing you'll need to do is pick a background.
[04-Jan-2014 20:00:00]  <IllFlower> I suggest consulting the existing character sheet; we have Complicated Community and Strong History characters
[04-Jan-2014 20:00:01]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 20:00:08]  <Saladofstones> Complicated History
[04-Jan-2014 20:00:20]  <Alicia> Wait so we're beginning now right.
[04-Jan-2014 20:00:27]  <Alicia> Can I go get milk real quick.
[04-Jan-2014 20:00:41]  <Saladofstones> you are denied heathen cow lactose
[04-Jan-2014 20:00:47]  <Alicia> Awwwwww.
[04-Jan-2014 20:01:06]  <IllFlower> we probably wouldn't be able to tell if you didn't mention it ;)
[04-Jan-2014 20:01:35]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: hey, we don't know, she could be getting goat milk ;)
[04-Jan-2014 20:01:36]  <Saladofstones> oh shit illflower did a winky face

[04-Jan-2014 20:02:21]  <rollermine> Barcode: pictures of cat
[04-Jan-2014 20:02:23]  <Barcode> k
[04-Jan-2014 20:02:43]  <Barcode> oh, he got out of that goofy position.
[04-Jan-2014 20:03:02]  <Alicia> Yeah, well, maybe all y'all still don't, IllFlower!
[04-Jan-2014 20:03:12]  <Alicia> Aaaanyway yeah I'm looking.
[04-Jan-2014 20:03:23]  <Barcode> +decide draw|social
[04-Jan-2014 20:03:23]  <rollermine> Barcode: draw
[04-Jan-2014 20:03:25]  <Barcode> k.
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:01]  <IllFlower> Alicia: don't sass me, young lady!
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:06]  <Alicia> I'm not seeing Complicated Community?
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:09]  <Alicia> OKAY, FIIINE.
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:16]  <Saladofstones> page 23
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:23]  <ponicalica> Alicia: complicated cmmunity is on page 23 :V
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:36]  <Barcode> idea: describe the backgrounds according to will smith
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:43]  <Alicia> Whoops. I didn't register it, I certainly saw the italics. :p
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:44]  <Alicia> :v*
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:49]  <Barcode> complicated community: "when a couple of guys, that were up to no good/started making trouble in the neighborhood"
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:56]  <Rig> Alicia's character was born in West Philly?
[04-Jan-2014 20:04:58]  <Alicia> Lol.
[04-Jan-2014 20:05:01]  <Nitya> i endorse this, barcode
[04-Jan-2014 20:05:14]  <Saladofstones> Complicated History can only be NWA
[04-Jan-2014 20:05:48]  <IllFlower> Barcode played the Complicated History character in our previous sessions, to give you an idea.
[04-Jan-2014 20:05:57]  <Nitya> so, melee rap megukas.
[04-Jan-2014 20:06:00]  * Alicia looks for the character sheets she remembers.
[04-Jan-2014 20:06:06]  <Alicia> Oh, right, IllFlower.
[04-Jan-2014 20:06:08]  <Barcode> pirate pad - wait i can't tabcomplete here

[04-Jan-2014 20:06:21]  * Barcode dodges backwards as Rig swings.
[04-Jan-2014 20:06:22]  <ponicalica> Rig and I are.
[04-Jan-2014 20:06:23]  <Saladofstones> I think I'm playing
[04-Jan-2014 20:06:44]  <IllFlower> Rig and ponicalica are carrying over, and then whoever makes it through character creation...
[04-Jan-2014 20:06:48]  <Barcode> Nitya: i endorse /that/
[04-Jan-2014 20:06:58]  <Nitya> obviously.
[04-Jan-2014 20:07:00]  <Barcode> okay yeah i'm spending the enxt couple hours drawing dumb things.
[04-Jan-2014 20:07:06]  <Nitya> woo

[04-Jan-2014 20:08:03]  <Barcodrawing> oh, the pirate pad thing, important to note - rig and ponicalica are still playing, i am not
[04-Jan-2014 20:08:06]  <Rig> Well, I mean, it doesn't really help if you come in with absolutely nothing.
[04-Jan-2014 20:08:12]  <Saladofstones> I have a concept
[04-Jan-2014 20:08:16]  <Saladofstones> no bonus points if you guess it

[04-Jan-2014 20:08:48]  <ponicalica> Alicia: Is the pink one you?
[04-Jan-2014 20:08:51]  <Nitya> Saladofstones: well not much else to do out there.
[04-Jan-2014 20:08:53]  <IllFlower> well, it helps if you guys pick a background first >_>
[04-Jan-2014 20:08:54]  <jseblan> Barcodrawing: the Fresh Witch Of Bel Air?
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:02]  <Alicia> Yes, ponny.
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:04]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: I picked complicated history
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:21]  <Barcodrawing> do keep in mind how your characters might interact with the ones that are already there
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:29]  <Barcodrawing> not a warning, just a suggestion to help guide your char design
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:30]  <IllFlower> oh, good, you can be our new borderline delinquent
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:34]  <Barcodrawing> hee
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:38]  <Saladofstones> >borderline
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:40]  <Rig> We do need one.
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:42]  <Saladofstones> are penal megucas still in?
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:51]  <Nitya> yeah, the whole oint of odgs's character creation thing is you as a group decide what's gonna hapen
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:57]  <Nitya> get on it nerds
[04-Jan-2014 20:09:59]  <IllFlower> right, I suppose it wouldn't be a bad idea to explain Rig and ponicalica's characters first
[04-Jan-2014 20:10:18]  <Rig> Should I take that as a cue to say things?
[04-Jan-2014 20:10:19]  <IllFlower> though the summaries on the character sheet ought to do the job
[04-Jan-2014 20:10:27]  <Barcodrawing> as many words as you can
[04-Jan-2014 20:10:29]  <IllFlower> Rig: sure, why not.
[04-Jan-2014 20:10:34]  <Barcodrawing> gotta turn on some autechre
[04-Jan-2014 20:10:43]  <Barcodrawing> gotta listen to second villbel....in flac
[04-Jan-2014 20:10:51]  <Nitya> lol why
[04-Jan-2014 20:11:01]  <Rig> I mean, Jun is pretty simple to understand. She was an emgirl that ran in a small group with some friends. They fucked up and she's the only survivor.
[04-Jan-2014 20:11:04]  <Barcodrawing> Nitya: i love it
[04-Jan-2014 20:11:10]  <Barcodrawing> [rhythmic static]
[04-Jan-2014 20:11:15]  <Rig> She thinks it's her responsibility to prevent other people from dying.

[04-Jan-2014 20:11:35]  <Rig> And as of the last session she pretty much is willing to go anything to protect people.
[04-Jan-2014 20:11:40]  <Rig> *do anything
[04-Jan-2014 20:11:55]  <Rig> Including burning down a school and killing herself in the process.
[04-Jan-2014 20:11:57]  <Saladofstones> does that include a very yandere idea or "I will kill those who aren't thep eople I will protect"
[04-Jan-2014 20:12:12]  <Alicia> I'll choose Strong Community.
[04-Jan-2014 20:12:14]  * Barcodrawing writes "medugaks" at the top of a sketchbook page. thinks
[04-Jan-2014 20:12:36]  <Nitya> what if megukas... rapped?? -- barcode's mind
[04-Jan-2014 20:12:37]  <Rig> No, it's more, "I will stop people who are going to hurt people no matter the cost to myself."
[04-Jan-2014 20:12:45]  <Rig> Megazudaks.

[04-Jan-2014 20:13:10]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: face witches get bitches
[04-Jan-2014 20:13:15]  <Rig> The Tomb of Fuck You're Blind
[04-Jan-2014 20:13:21]  <IllFlower> okay, I have those noted down on the characte sheet.
[04-Jan-2014 20:13:28]  <Barcodrawing> tomb of What Do You Mean, I need a Holy Weapon To Fight Ravelord
[04-Jan-2014 20:13:37]  <Rig> Holy Glowstick.
[04-Jan-2014 20:13:47]  <Saladofstones> I can't believe my onii-chan is a skeleton in a tomb!
[04-Jan-2014 20:13:51]  <Rig> Occult Drop
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:00]  <Nitya> maybe you should focus on the character creation.
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:08]  <Barcodrawing> sorry for fucking around.go ahead, i'll share sketches later
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:10]  <Rig> I'm offering important ideas.
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:12]  <Barcodrawing> which might even be...........of characters
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:19]  <Rig> You could play a rave meduka.
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:22]  <IllFlower> so we have Saladofstones as the nu-delinquent and Alicia as the one coming from a generally stable community.
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:30]  <Rig> Boo hiss.
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:34]  <Rig> We don't want no stable folks.
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:48]  <IllFlower> the stable ones are the ones we can break horribly
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:50]  <Saladofstones> Rig: she could be shellshocked from what she thought it was going to be and what it is
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:54]  <Saladofstones> PTSD meduka
[04-Jan-2014 20:14:54]  <Alicia> I was honestly actually going to choose complicated history, but, I mean.
[04-Jan-2014 20:15:01]  <Barcodrawing> variety's good.
[04-Jan-2014 20:15:04]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: join the yankee aliance
[04-Jan-2014 20:15:08]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 20:15:14]  <Rig> Variety is good.
[04-Jan-2014 20:15:17]  <Saladofstones> .decide serbian war criminal|michael jackson
[04-Jan-2014 20:15:22]  <Alicia> No I'll be the good girl of the group, unlike everyone else. :p
[04-Jan-2014 20:15:22]  <Saladofstones> fuck you feepbot
[04-Jan-2014 20:15:23]  <Barcodrawing> +
[04-Jan-2014 20:15:23]  <IllFlower> plus if everyone does the same thing, there's less opportunity for interesting tension, by which I mean you guys constantly arguing with each other!
[04-Jan-2014 20:15:23]  <ponicalica> no feepbot here
[04-Jan-2014 20:16:03]  <IllFlower> okay, if we're done here, let's move on to stat allocation.
[04-Jan-2014 20:16:07]  <Saladofstones> okay
[04-Jan-2014 20:16:15]  <IllFlower> helpfully, this step immediately follows the previous one!
[04-Jan-2014 20:16:29]  <Alicia> :D
[04-Jan-2014 20:16:30]  <Rig> Excellent.
[04-Jan-2014 20:16:35]  <Barcodrawing> innovative.
[04-Jan-2014 20:16:40]  <Rig> And stats are easy to map to character ideas.
[04-Jan-2014 20:16:55]  <Rig> Jun has lots of heart and body because she's stupidly passionate and violent.
[04-Jan-2014 20:17:03]  <IllFlower> note that Acuity also covers your use of magic.
[04-Jan-2014 20:17:05]  <Rig> But not a lot of accuity.
[04-Jan-2014 20:17:05]  <Saladofstones> oh should we go over character ideas now or after
[04-Jan-2014 20:17:22]  <Barcodrawing> during, yeah, as long as they're relevant to statsing, i guess
[04-Jan-2014 20:17:24]  <Saladofstones> Rig: wouldn't Will also factor into the passion and violence
[04-Jan-2014 20:17:28]  <ponicalica> Right now, we have the suicidally dedicated Jun and the heavily trained but inexperienced Ayako
[04-Jan-2014 20:17:38]  <Saladofstones> Well I figure since I am in love with penal megucas, that is my idea for my character
[04-Jan-2014 20:17:40]  * Alicia reads the second step, thinks about what she wants her stats to be.
[04-Jan-2014 20:17:58]  <IllFlower> to map to Dogs' levels of conflict: verbal conflict = Acuity + Heart. physical = Body + Heart. hand-to-hand combat = Body + Will. magical = Acuity + Will.
[04-Jan-2014 20:18:14]  <Alicia> Thanks.
[04-Jan-2014 20:18:20]  <Saladofstones> but given that penal megucas are likely not the most uptight of citizens, I'd imagine that her body is rather high
[04-Jan-2014 20:18:26]  <Saladofstones> in terms of stats
[04-Jan-2014 20:18:37]  <Rig> I dunno how I feel about the whole prisoner thing.
[04-Jan-2014 20:19:03]  <IllFlower> don't forget that the number of stat dice you have depends on your background.
[04-Jan-2014 20:19:03]  <Rig> It seems kind of weird for a group that literally just fought a meduka that went bad for them to just get assigned a new one.
[04-Jan-2014 20:19:12]  <Rig> I mean, I guess it'd create tension.
[04-Jan-2014 20:19:20]  <Rig> Jun definitely wouldn't like her.
[04-Jan-2014 20:19:29]  <ponicalica> Yeah, I'm with Rig, I feel like that idea kind of clashes with the purpose of Conservators :V
[04-Jan-2014 20:19:32]  <Alicia> I'm just going to say ??? for now because I'm still thinking on a name. Or, well, deciding.
[04-Jan-2014 20:19:35]  <ponicalica> I guess IllFlower should weigh in, since it's his universe.
[04-Jan-2014 20:19:36]  <Barcodrawing> Something that could map to our first session /is/ the idea of penalization, though that would also depend on you guys deciding how exactly penalization works.
[04-Jan-2014 20:19:55]  <Barcodrawing> Also, the Conservators are granted their status because they're good at what they do. Regular dokers are still regular dokers.
[04-Jan-2014 20:20:01]  <IllFlower> gimme a second, I'm still doing some setup.
[04-Jan-2014 20:20:07]  <Alicia> Okay.
[04-Jan-2014 20:20:08]  <Saladofstones> The idea is that my character wasn't lol genocide, but someone who used her powers in ways that opposte the status quo
[04-Jan-2014 20:20:32]  <Saladofstones> perhaps someone involved in a civil war, or someone who was inducted into the wrong crowd but otherwise shown dedication aligned with the conservators/fixers
[04-Jan-2014 20:20:51]  <Barcodrawing> Yeah, I mean. That works, though it's not something that would get you Conservator status. Of course, the rules also say you can have someone who just gets associated with the fixers for whatever reason
[04-Jan-2014 20:20:53]  <Saladofstones> I'd imagine it would not be anyone who opposed them fundamentally or unstable/unreliable prisoners
[04-Jan-2014 20:21:03]  <IllFlower> those creating characters, feel free to directly add your stats and such to the character sheet. scroll down to about line 190.
[04-Jan-2014 20:21:25]  <Alicia> Got it.
[04-Jan-2014 20:21:29]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: if its okay, I want to know if my character basis is accepted before I start putting in stats
[04-Jan-2014 20:21:33]  <Alicia> 17 stats? Right…
[04-Jan-2014 20:21:35]  <Saladofstones> since that might change where I take the character
[04-Jan-2014 20:21:36]  <Alicia> stat points*
[04-Jan-2014 20:21:49]  <IllFlower> Alicia: you have 13, don't start editing Saladofstones' stats :p
[04-Jan-2014 20:21:59]  <Saladofstones> I have 15
[04-Jan-2014 20:22:02]  <Alicia> Oh, whoops, 13.
[04-Jan-2014 20:22:03]  <Saladofstones> don't touch my stats yo
[04-Jan-2014 20:22:20]  <Saladofstones> Rig: I'd imagine there'd be conflict, since I imagine your character like JUSTICE from akame ga kiru
[04-Jan-2014 20:22:38]  <Rig> I dunno what that is at all.
[04-Jan-2014 20:22:40]  <Saladofstones> but I have to look through the logs to see what happened with the last meguca
[04-Jan-2014 20:23:16]  <Saladofstones> Rig: one of the characters, convinced that she is correct, willing to do anything to uphold her friends and ideals, doesn't get along with anyone who doesn't conform to her ideas, rather black and white in her thinking
[04-Jan-2014 20:23:20]  <IllFlower> well, the story is such that Shii (this group's familiar) is in trouble with the higher-ups.
[04-Jan-2014 20:23:21]  <Saladofstones> 0,0 half the woman she used to be
[04-Jan-2014 20:23:25]  <Alicia> Ack this chat is fast.
[04-Jan-2014 20:23:30]  <IllFlower> after the general failure of the last mission.
[04-Jan-2014 20:23:39]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 20:23:48]  <Saladofstones> it could be that is why someone who is a 'penal meguca' is assigned?
[04-Jan-2014 20:23:52]  <Saladofstones> or part of why
[04-Jan-2014 20:24:06]  <Saladofstones> I'd imagine if he is in trouble with the higher-ups, he doesn't get the best selection, right?
[04-Jan-2014 20:24:09]  <IllFlower> so depending on how punitive they are, they might reassign her one of the Conservators' more insubordinate members, but it'd have to be someone that would be able to *be* a Conservator in the first place.
[04-Jan-2014 20:24:41]  <Saladofstones> well she'd be someone who'd want to be a conservator, at least now, and with skills relevant to what the familiar needs
[04-Jan-2014 20:25:00]  <IllFlower> and the hierarchy isn't motivated by spite; rarely does spite manage to make it out of committee.
[04-Jan-2014 20:25:16]  <Saladofstones> I'd imagine something more than an explosive collar is needed at this stage, it could be someone who was a penal meguca for awhile now (relatively) and recently got promoted to be a conservator
[04-Jan-2014 20:25:31]  <Saladofstones> so her crime wouldn't have to be too heinous at this point, or at least its overlooked
[04-Jan-2014 20:26:03]  <IllFlower> there'd still need to be good reason for that promotion. the inertia of a bad reputation is quite strong.
[04-Jan-2014 20:26:17]  *** SpruceZeus|away is now known as SpruceZeus
[04-Jan-2014 20:26:21]  <Saladofstones> well what is the turnover rate for conservators?
[04-Jan-2014 20:26:26]  <Alicia> ???: Body is 4d6, Acuity is 3d6, Heart is 4d6, Will is 2d6.
[04-Jan-2014 20:26:29]  <Alicia> I believe.
[04-Jan-2014 20:26:55]  <IllFlower> not high. the hierarchy has its troubles but it's not obviously dysfunctional.
[04-Jan-2014 20:27:09]  <Alicia> Like most any *good* organization?
[04-Jan-2014 20:27:16]  <Alicia> Or well-designed, whatever.
[04-Jan-2014 20:27:27]  <Saladofstones> hmm, but I'd imagine that conservators are stretched on resources, right?
[04-Jan-2014 20:27:44]  <IllFlower> not necessarily.
[04-Jan-2014 20:27:45]  <Rig> I dunno. They had a library and shit.
[04-Jan-2014 20:27:55]  <Barcodrawing> a library with a donjon, even.
[04-Jan-2014 20:28:02]  <Saladofstones> even with the inertia of a bad reputation, for someone to be a penal megjuca and get anywhere in the organization would require some basis that they can be trusted
[04-Jan-2014 20:28:28]  <IllFlower> they had enough to send three Conservators after a kid with a book, so they're not exactly short-handed.
[04-Jan-2014 20:28:31]  <Saladofstones> granted, it might be like escape from new york with SNAAAKE, but the powers that be view them as not a threat at the least
[04-Jan-2014 20:28:53]  <Alicia> How would newer entries be treated?
[04-Jan-2014 20:28:53]  <Rig> I really don't understand the concept I guess. Like they're being punished by being trusted?
[04-Jan-2014 20:28:55]  <Alicia> Like mine.
[04-Jan-2014 20:28:55]  <IllFlower> right, but you'd have to make a strong case for why that character *can* be trusted.
[04-Jan-2014 20:29:10]  <Alicia> Or, well, new to the group and such, that deal.
[04-Jan-2014 20:29:12]  <IllFlower> Alicia: newer entries? like fresh inductees, you mean?
[04-Jan-2014 20:29:16]  <Alicia> Yes.
[04-Jan-2014 20:29:24]  <Alicia> Pretty much.
[04-Jan-2014 20:29:38]  <Saladofstones> Rig: They aren't being punished, the idea being that they are prisoners who can be trusted, generalyl those with background in-line with being a conservator
[04-Jan-2014 20:29:49]  <Saladofstones> I don't imagine every penal meguca is a lol evil kinda person
[04-Jan-2014 20:30:04]  <Alicia> So would you be punished by us basically watching over you or what.
[04-Jan-2014 20:30:06]  <IllFlower> Alicia: I dunno, it really depends on how Rig and ponicalica play it.
[04-Jan-2014 20:30:10]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: The big thing is that fixers are basically like cops, or cop investigators. You don't give prisoners police jurisdiction.
[04-Jan-2014 20:30:10]  <Alicia> Noted.
[04-Jan-2014 20:30:21]  <Barcodrawing> Like, anywhere.
[04-Jan-2014 20:30:29]  <Saladofstones> Barcodrawing: I got the feeling that it was sort of like the wild west, so you had laxer standards
[04-Jan-2014 20:30:52]  <IllFlower> it's not, it's the Mormon West. those have rather higher standards :p
[04-Jan-2014 20:31:00]  <Rig> And more wives.
[04-Jan-2014 20:31:08]  <Saladofstones> Maybe I converted into mormonism
[04-Jan-2014 20:31:08]  <Barcodrawing> There's also what IF said, re "they sent three people after one kid".
[04-Jan-2014 20:31:09]  <Alicia> Yes, important details.
[04-Jan-2014 20:31:20]  <Barcodrawing> "plus their dog"
[04-Jan-2014 20:31:36]  <Barcodrawing> or i guess, they sent a dog and its three people under one kid.
[04-Jan-2014 20:31:36]  <IllFlower> Alicia: I would note that ponicalica has the "book smart but somewhat naive" corner.
[04-Jan-2014 20:31:53]  <Alicia> Just checking, but I'm 13d6 because I came from a generally good area right.
[04-Jan-2014 20:31:54]  <Barcodrawing> after one kid*
[04-Jan-2014 20:31:55]  <Nitya> you oughta be willing to rethink the prisoner thing, illflower isn't one for eplosive collars
[04-Jan-2014 20:32:12]  <ponicalica> Also you're kind of not supposed to go in with an idea :V
[04-Jan-2014 20:32:16]  <Alicia> I remember, IllFlower. Trying to think about what I want…
[04-Jan-2014 20:32:26]  <Saladofstones> if its a problem I can switch gears
[04-Jan-2014 20:32:33]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: like, when it comes to the actual characterization, what would you like to do? Straddle the boundary of allowed and not allowed? You can eeeasily play a character that does questionable stuff to get conservator stuff done, I mean, I sort of went in trying to do so.
[04-Jan-2014 20:32:45]  <IllFlower> Alicia: I think there's room for an "ambitious new recruit" character even there, though.
[04-Jan-2014 20:32:46]  <Saladofstones> but I feel wrt to prisoners, it has to be someone that can be trusted without a gun to their head
[04-Jan-2014 20:32:46]  <Barcodrawing> then i kinda wussed out from being more than just physical.
[04-Jan-2014 20:33:02]  <Alicia> Those are actually the words I was looking for, IllFlower. :v
[04-Jan-2014 20:33:17]  <Barcodrawing> but you could easily cover a more illicit "gets stuff done questionably" angle, without necessarily making a cop prisoner or what not.
[04-Jan-2014 20:33:24]  <Alicia> Gosh, sorry. I'm kind of stressed today. Trying to dive into this to take my mind off things, etc.
[04-Jan-2014 20:33:37]  <Alicia> (I mean I'm still doing this I'm just slower than usual.)
[04-Jan-2014 20:33:51]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: as for why, the basis of the idea is that its someone that is willing to follow their orders blindly at this stage either out of reformed dedication or other reasons
[04-Jan-2014 20:34:15]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: yeah, "eager recruit" is good enough, you'd just probably want to make it more "determination" than "good magician", as Ponny already is doing.
[04-Jan-2014 20:34:15]  <Saladofstones> at any rate, whatever crimes they did didn't outweigh their reliability and what caused them to be penal can be valuable to whatever needs to be done
[04-Jan-2014 20:34:35]  <Alicia> Determined and stubborn and maybe a little bit arrogant, Barcodrawing. :p
[04-Jan-2014 20:34:41]  <Alicia> (Little.)
[04-Jan-2014 20:34:46]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: It'll work, for sure.
[04-Jan-2014 20:34:47]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: You're prime urobutcheree material
[04-Jan-2014 20:34:53]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: If you really want to do something related to being punished - you could always play a conservator that's returning to active duty after being penalized for something.
[04-Jan-2014 20:34:56]  <Alicia> Aw, thank you.
[04-Jan-2014 20:35:14]  <Saladofstones> that sounds good
[04-Jan-2014 20:35:20]  <Barcodrawing> The previous session already had a sort of "what happens to people when they get detained" thing going on, but you'd have to talk to IF (and everyone else) for the specifics of that.
[04-Jan-2014 20:35:27]  <Rig> "I just got out of the pen and I'm ready to crack some skulls."
[04-Jan-2014 20:35:28]  <IllFlower> got court-martialed, haha.
[04-Jan-2014 20:35:36]  <Rig> "Why were you in the pen?"
[04-Jan-2014 20:35:41]  <Rig> "I cracked too many skulls."
[04-Jan-2014 20:35:45]  <Barcodrawing> Heeheehee
[04-Jan-2014 20:35:49]  <Saladofstones> "I didn't sign my paper form 11f-b correctly"
[04-Jan-2014 20:36:21]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: So what kind of network does the detained-part of megucahood have?
[04-Jan-2014 20:36:25]  <Barcodrawing> you're a loose cannon homuro, but a damn good cop
[04-Jan-2014 20:36:39]  <Alicia> Is there a list of traits in the back?
[04-Jan-2014 20:36:51]  <IllFlower> Alicia: no, there's not. hold on a second, we're not quite there yet.
[04-Jan-2014 20:36:58]  <Alicia> Okay.
[04-Jan-2014 20:37:07]  * Alicia wanted to look ahead to get thinking, is all.
[04-Jan-2014 20:37:08]  <Saladofstones> well I got a basic idea of the character, background or no
[04-Jan-2014 20:37:15]  <SpruceZeus> Barcodrawing: dammit youre off the force, turn in your ruffles and high heels
[04-Jan-2014 20:37:19]  <IllFlower> Alicia: also, if you want to play "eager recruit" you probably want to assign more than 2d6 to Will.
[04-Jan-2014 20:37:34]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: what do you mean by "network"?
[04-Jan-2014 20:37:40]  <Alicia> Right.
[04-Jan-2014 20:37:45]  <Barcodrawing> SpruceZeus: meguka tears frills of her skirt and puts them on table
[04-Jan-2014 20:37:48]  <Saladofstones> well how does the criminal element of megucas
[04-Jan-2014 20:37:56]  <Saladofstones> Barcodrawing: turning in the badge?
[04-Jan-2014 20:37:59]  <Saladofstones> work
[04-Jan-2014 20:38:03]  <IllFlower> I wasn't joking with the court martial comment, I imagine that being approximately the process for a disgraced Conservator.
[04-Jan-2014 20:38:21]  <Rig> I do like the idea of a meduka that was put on probation and pretty much got handed back to our commissioner.
[04-Jan-2014 20:38:33]  <Rig> "Take this one, she fucked up. You have a lot in common."
[04-Jan-2014 20:38:37]  <Saladofstones> I'm for that idea as well
[04-Jan-2014 20:38:39]  <Barcodrawing> haha
[04-Jan-2014 20:39:02]  <Alicia> I put 2d6 there since I thought that she could be, like, eager and all of that but that doesn't mean she's *good*. Sure she can be confident, but noooot exactly unflichable.
[04-Jan-2014 20:39:04]  <IllFlower> unnecessary civilian casualties might be a reason, actually.
[04-Jan-2014 20:39:19]  <Saladofstones> I don't really imagine a loose cannon type character
[04-Jan-2014 20:39:23]  <IllFlower> Alicia: that's more an Acuity thing.
[04-Jan-2014 20:39:34]  <Saladofstones> I'm sure thats the last thing you guys need :V
[04-Jan-2014 20:39:34]  <Alicia> Ah, noted.
[04-Jan-2014 20:39:36]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: not even a loose cannon, just someone who got sloppy.
[04-Jan-2014 20:39:42]  <Alicia> I'll adjust as needed then.
[04-Jan-2014 20:39:47]  <ponicalica> Also 2d6 is the minimum.  That basically means you're *weak*-willed.
[04-Jan-2014 20:39:49]  <Saladofstones> what about a general abuse of power
[04-Jan-2014 20:40:07]  <IllFlower> that'd bring into question why the character was reinstated, though.
[04-Jan-2014 20:40:20]  <Alicia> Point.
[04-Jan-2014 20:40:40]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 20:40:41]  <IllFlower> unnecessary accidents, you can argue they couldn't be helped.
[04-Jan-2014 20:40:50]  <Saladofstones> what kind of politics goes on?
[04-Jan-2014 20:40:58]  <IllFlower> abuse of power, that's going to give you more trouble.
[04-Jan-2014 20:41:09]  <Saladofstones> there could have been a conflict between several people and the meguca in question was the sacrifical lamb
[04-Jan-2014 20:41:20]  <Barcodrawing> Nitya: currently trying to draw a wizard's hat with a baseball cap brim
[04-Jan-2014 20:41:20]  <Alicia> Okay I think I've got it, IllFlower.
[04-Jan-2014 20:41:33]  <Alicia> Is Hikari a usable name.
[04-Jan-2014 20:41:34]  <Saladofstones> Barcodrawing: gandalf with beer cap
[04-Jan-2014 20:41:39]  <IllFlower> that might be interesting, getting thrown under the bus.
[04-Jan-2014 20:41:45]  <Alicia> Or, wait.
[04-Jan-2014 20:41:49]  <Nitya> Barcodrawing: godspeed you crazy fuck
[04-Jan-2014 20:41:50]  <Alicia> An NPC used/uses that huh.
[04-Jan-2014 20:42:01]  <ponicalica> There can be duplicate names.  :P
[04-Jan-2014 20:42:13]  <Barcodrawing> Kihari
[04-Jan-2014 20:42:14]  <Nitya> haha,now i'm imagining the actual spoilery plot of the spy who came in from the cold.
[04-Jan-2014 20:42:17]  <Nitya> on da shelf
[04-Jan-2014 20:42:22]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: So they get demoted, are understanding of the situation (perhaps was on the losing side of that argument)
[04-Jan-2014 20:42:44]  <IllFlower> I don't want to get *too* deep into the details of how the internal politics work, though, at least not yet. like I said, I don't want to be diving into the Order's internal dysfunction.
[04-Jan-2014 20:42:59]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: well it doesn't even have to be stated to the other characters
[04-Jan-2014 20:43:07]  <Saladofstones> just "this person fucked up and was given another chance"
[04-Jan-2014 20:43:22]  <Saladofstones> perhaps rumors about an internal conflict and a crackdown for foreshadowing
[04-Jan-2014 20:43:25]  <IllFlower> yeah, that works fine, we can always fill in the blanks later.
[04-Jan-2014 20:43:29]  <Alicia> "She only killed three people maaaaan."
[04-Jan-2014 20:43:32]  <Alicia> S/he*
[04-Jan-2014 20:43:51]  <Saladofstones> Nitya: that was a depressing story
[04-Jan-2014 20:44:58]  <Saladofstones> as far as stats, body is 4d6, will is 5d6, heart is 2d6, acuity is 5d6
[04-Jan-2014 20:45:12]  <ponicalica> It'll be fun to have Ayako deny the Order's internal dysfunction even existing though. :P
[04-Jan-2014 20:45:16]  <Alicia> I really want to use Hiiragi, but it reminds me of Lucky Star but I like the name. >_<
[04-Jan-2014 20:45:18]  <Barcodrawing> haha, he really is filling in my absence :}
[04-Jan-2014 20:45:26]  <Barcodrawing> hiiraragi-san
[04-Jan-2014 20:45:43]  <Saladofstones> heart is 2d6 not so I can min-max but assuming that they aren't the most empathetic of people
[04-Jan-2014 20:45:54]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: oh trust me, 2d6 in heart is a weakness
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:01]  <Alicia> Sssshhh.
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:06]  <Alicia> Let Salad find out. :p
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:12]  <Saladofstones> >my meguca dies of heart attack
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:15]  <Saladofstones> >not enough heart
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:18]  <Barcodrawing> not in a "you're fucked" way, just in a "it makes things more interesting/forces you to actually play your characteR" way
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:27]  <ponicalica> Ayako had 2d6 heart
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:29]  <Barcodrawing> like, based on your stats this basically means you'll try to convince people for fifteen seconds before punching 'em
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:32]  <SpruceZeus> the character i played in the original magical burst campaign was kind of minmaxed
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:39]  <SpruceZeus> it was in character though >_>
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:45]  <Barcodrawing> "she played a lot of RPGs"
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:45]  <Saladofstones> weren't you literally made of fireworks?
[04-Jan-2014 20:46:51]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: basically
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:00]  <Barcodrawing> SpruceZeus: shoulda fireworkjumpexc
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:03]  <Barcodrawing> fireworkjumped*
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:05]  <Saladofstones> "they told me I could be anything I wanted, so I became a firework"
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:10]  <IllFlower> Alicia: wasn't that the name of the character you never played for MB? haha
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:25]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: so going with the idea, how international is the group?
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:29]  <Saladofstones> or am I limited to the moon
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:34]  <Saladofstones> 0,0 I was going to pick Polish
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:42]  <SpruceZeus> Saladofstones: pretty much yeah lol
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:43]  <Alicia> Yes, IllFlower. >___>;
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:51]  <Alicia> Can I use it again plz
[04-Jan-2014 20:47:59]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: you weren't even in that campaign, it's not like it's an issue :P
[04-Jan-2014 20:48:05]  <Alicia> Right, heh.
[04-Jan-2014 20:48:08]  <Saladofstones> badum-pish
[04-Jan-2014 20:48:13]  <Barcodrawing> not an insult >:I
[04-Jan-2014 20:48:30]  <Alicia> No, yeah, I get what you meant.
[04-Jan-2014 20:48:33]  <Saladofstones> so I figure that this person maybe savvy but is obligated not to talk about what happened
[04-Jan-2014 20:48:36]  <Barcodrawing> Nitya: i'm settling for wizard hat spire + baseball cap brim.
[04-Jan-2014 20:48:37]  <Saladofstones> my character
[04-Jan-2014 20:48:44]  <Alicia> Also I've divvied my statz.
[04-Jan-2014 20:48:48]  <SpruceZeus> perhaps it is good for her that the campaign ended prematurely, as i was fully intending for her to die tragically
[04-Jan-2014 20:49:06]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: well, if you're going to play a foreign character you'll have to keep in mind that's going to stick out like a sore thumb, so unless you and the other players are comfortable with actually addressing that I'd advise against it.
[04-Jan-2014 20:49:21]  <Saladofstones> I'm willing to address it
[04-Jan-2014 20:49:40]  <Saladofstones> its up to others, I like eastern europeans but I'm willing to be from Osaka or something
[04-Jan-2014 20:49:45]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: the other thing is, consider that your character's going to mostly make its name doing character-y stuff, not because it was a 1-winged yugoslavic angel or whatever
[04-Jan-2014 20:49:54]  <Barcodrawing> it is a*
[04-Jan-2014 20:50:02]  <Saladofstones> hey snezana was a balanced character :V
[04-Jan-2014 20:50:13]  <Alicia> I am from Tokyo.
[04-Jan-2014 20:50:16]  <Alicia> Because.
[04-Jan-2014 20:50:16]  <IllFlower> note to self: start a metal band called "One-Winged Yugoslavian Angel"
[04-Jan-2014 20:50:18]  <Saladofstones> but I figure being a transfer might be interesting at any rate
[04-Jan-2014 20:50:27]  <Barcodrawing> IllFlower: i'm listening to black sabbath's Rusty Angels right now!
[04-Jan-2014 20:50:29]  <Saladofstones> to remove her from whatever environment she was in
[04-Jan-2014 20:50:40]  <SpruceZeus> hey that reminds me, i was thinking earlier that 'Z Chromosome' would be a sweet name for a punk band
[04-Jan-2014 20:50:41]  <Barcodrawing> well, she could transfer from another neeponese city.
[04-Jan-2014 20:50:49]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 20:51:02]  <ponicalica> hokkaido's the island that's way north, right?
[04-Jan-2014 20:51:06]  <Saladofstones> what about half-japanese? Since those are some popular in my chinese cartoons
[04-Jan-2014 20:51:08]  <IllFlower> some parts of Osaka are pretty rough, just sayin'
[04-Jan-2014 20:51:18]  <Saladofstones> so half-russian, half-japanese born in osaka, has tattoos and is 20 feet tall
[04-Jan-2014 20:51:25]  <Barcodrawing> tattoo 2d6 - maybe she's part of the yakuza???
[04-Jan-2014 20:51:37]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: 10 feet tall and no sense of rhythm / 2d4

[04-Jan-2014 20:51:59]  <Rig> I'm relatively okay with the Polish thing, but I really don't have much to say about gaijin in Japan other than that they mostly get ignored.
[04-Jan-2014 20:52:13]  <IllFlower> Barcodrawing: "six foot ten and weighs a fucking ton, 2d4"
[04-Jan-2014 20:52:20]  <Rig> Heh.
[04-Jan-2014 20:52:23]  <Saladofstones> I'll be from Osaka, I don't want to complicate things with unnecesary elements
[04-Jan-2014 20:52:33]  <Saladofstones> I figure to keep with the character, my love of eastern europe has to suffer
[04-Jan-2014 20:52:34]  <Alicia> I'm from Toe Kyo.
[04-Jan-2014 20:52:47]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: your character is a sovietboo obviously
[04-Jan-2014 20:52:47]  <Barcodrawing> IllFlower: "You chase the errant meguka through an air duct, but your buttocks comedically plug your entrance and stop you dead in your tracks.
[04-Jan-2014 20:52:52]  <Barcodrawing> "
[04-Jan-2014 20:53:02]  <IllFlower> ahahaha, oh God.
[04-Jan-2014 20:53:23]  <Saladofstones> Barcodrawing: I am remembering venture brothers where brock is getting his kester searched and he clinches his buttocks around the guys hand uses him to kill some guys

[04-Jan-2014 20:53:34]  <Rig> A good episode.
[04-Jan-2014 20:53:51]  <Rig> Anyway, time for traits!
[04-Jan-2014 20:54:03]  <IllFlower> just a second, let me look over the stats one last time.
[04-Jan-2014 20:54:06]  <Saladofstones> (no one will get the reference, glorious kantai)
[04-Jan-2014 20:54:16]  <Alicia> You weeb.
[04-Jan-2014 20:54:17]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: Makes lots of nerdy references 2d4
[04-Jan-2014 20:54:35]  <Saladofstones> named after a ship, 1d6

[04-Jan-2014 20:54:52]  <Rig> addicted to bad rpg card games - 2d4
[04-Jan-2014 20:54:56]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: so Acuity 5d6 suggests that your character's good with books and the technical side of magic, is that about right?
[04-Jan-2014 20:55:28]  <IllFlower> or someone who can think on her feet, something along those lines.
[04-Jan-2014 20:55:31]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: not sure how book smart I'm, how about perceptive
[04-Jan-2014 20:55:42]  <Saladofstones> I'm thinking perceptive, technical side of magic
[04-Jan-2014 20:55:50]  <Saladofstones> can this be negative traits as well?
[04-Jan-2014 20:55:51]  <Barcodrawing> an old investigator could have a good eye for cluez or whatever
[04-Jan-2014 20:55:52]  <IllFlower> yeah, that works.
[04-Jan-2014 20:56:15]  <Saladofstones> Rig: Man I can quit whenever I want
[04-Jan-2014 20:56:19]  <Saladofstones> but my kanmasu need me
[04-Jan-2014 20:56:19]  <IllFlower> notices things, can talk fast, is good with magic, I can run with that.
[04-Jan-2014 20:56:23]  <Alicia> "It's just like a puzzle games, except people actually die."
[04-Jan-2014 20:56:31]  <Alicia> my puzzle games*
[04-Jan-2014 20:56:49]  <Saladofstones> Hibiki comes across a dead body in alleyway, a crowbar forced into its back, "Maybe it was the crowbar?"
[04-Jan-2014 20:56:58]  <ponicalica> it's just like my Soviet Sherlock Holmes adaptation!
[04-Jan-2014 20:57:08]  <Barcodrawing> so, traits
[04-Jan-2014 20:57:31]  <IllFlower> yeah, let's move on to traits.
[04-Jan-2014 20:57:31]  <Alicia> Hikari jumps into things too quickly or to takes too long to jump in.
[04-Jan-2014 20:57:32]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: Does the Kansai region have specific name patterns or is it all moon?
[04-Jan-2014 20:57:35]  <Alicia> No in-between.
[04-Jan-2014 20:57:50]  <IllFlower> it's not distinctly different, as far as I'm aware.
[04-Jan-2014 20:57:54]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: Bad sense of timing could be a #d4 trait.
[04-Jan-2014 20:57:54]  <IllFlower> you're not talking Okinawa here.
[04-Jan-2014 20:58:00]  <Saladofstones> "I?m a Dog: Since your character?s a Dog, ?I?m a Dog? makes a very reasonable Trait."
[04-Jan-2014 20:58:06]  <Alicia> So, hotheaded also indecisive, depending on the context?
[04-Jan-2014 20:58:07]  <Saladofstones> I would like that RP option
[04-Jan-2014 20:58:08]  <Barcodrawing> i already made bark jokes
[04-Jan-2014 20:58:11]  <Saladofstones> "yes" "no" "I'm a dog"
[04-Jan-2014 20:58:23]  <Alicia> Yeah, like that Barcodrawing.
[04-Jan-2014 20:58:27]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: perhaps bad at reading the atmosphere
[04-Jan-2014 20:58:40]  <Barcodrawing> That would mayyybe go back to acuity,.
[04-Jan-2014 20:58:40]  <Saladofstones> prone to rather quick judgements, that may be right or wrong

[04-Jan-2014 20:58:57]  <ponicalica> Barcodrawing: well, traits are for particular things
[04-Jan-2014 20:59:03]  <Alicia> Well I was thinking she's not *bad* at reading how things go on, just… impulsive, at times? So yeah following the gut would work.
[04-Jan-2014 20:59:07]  <IllFlower> a reminder here that traits are *how* you fight. relationships (which we'll get to in a second) motivate *why* you fight.
[04-Jan-2014 20:59:13]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 20:59:19]  <Alicia> Oh, traits are how you fight.
[04-Jan-2014 20:59:21]  <Alicia> Violently.
[04-Jan-2014 20:59:25]  <Alicia> :v
[04-Jan-2014 20:59:34]  <Saladofstones> I figure Hibiki is someone who isn't fully political, but someone with a strong sense of self preservation

[04-Jan-2014 20:59:38]  <Saladofstones> so I don't know hwo to traitify that
[04-Jan-2014 20:59:42]  <Saladofstones> it could be a negative, though
[04-Jan-2014 20:59:44]  <ponicalica> "Magically chant first, ask questions later"
[04-Jan-2014 20:59:59]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: "Strong sense of self-preservation 1d6"
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:01]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: could be like, Opportunistic #d6. You are good at taking openings in fights, and you also take your chances in less intense situations too.
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:06]  <ponicalica> (or whatever dice value you want)
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:16]  <Saladofstones> to my understanding, 1d4 is more risky than 1d6, right?
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:18]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: oh, also, your stat dice add up to 16, not 15.
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:20]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: if the self-prservation helps her, pick #d6 or #d8. If it hurts her, #d4.
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:23]  <Alicia> Actually yeah, opportunistic is good.
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:30]  <Saladofstones> oh
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:39]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: yeah, the way the game works the lower the die value you assign to a trait, the more you're implying it's a bad thing
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:45]  <Barcodrawing> bad thing/gets character in trouble*
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:45]  <Alicia> So I'll take cheap shots when I can, if needed.
[04-Jan-2014 21:00:58]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: knock one off of body, unless that fucks up my character direction
[04-Jan-2014 21:01:02]  <Alicia> But I'm not really against playing particularly dirty even if it gets me in hot water.
[04-Jan-2014 21:01:16]  <Barcodrawing> SO: the numbero f FACES on the die determines how bad or good it is, the number dice themselves determines how important that is.
[04-Jan-2014 21:01:20]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: okay, done. you can directly edit the sheet if you need to.
[04-Jan-2014 21:01:26]  <Alicia> Which could lead to overdoing or underdoing things, I guess.
[04-Jan-2014 21:01:42]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: Sorta fits under opportunistic, unless you want "fights dirty" as a separate trait.

[04-Jan-2014 21:01:54]  <Saladofstones> I get the feeling lack of expierence could be something

[04-Jan-2014 21:02:17]  <Barcodrawing> well it could be "hasn't warmed up to conservating yet 2d4" or something
[04-Jan-2014 21:02:18]  <Alicia> 1d4 lack of experience? 3d6 fights dirty? 2d8 opprtunistic?

[04-Jan-2014 21:02:22]  <Alicia> opportunistic*
[04-Jan-2014 21:02:28]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: could work
[04-Jan-2014 21:02:37]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: though keep in mind traits are not only for fighting.
[04-Jan-2014 21:02:37]  <Saladofstones> it might be fun to have two opportunistic characters from very different backgrounds

[04-Jan-2014 21:02:42]  <Barcodrawing> in fact most of the shit you do in the game is not fighting.
[04-Jan-2014 21:02:50]  <Saladofstones> Well perhaps my character is sort of like altair
[04-Jan-2014 21:02:52]  <Barcodrawing> or at least fighting to hurt.
[04-Jan-2014 21:02:56]  <Saladofstones> was higher ranking but got demoted as well

[04-Jan-2014 21:03:10]  <Alicia> Noted, Barcodrawing.
[04-Jan-2014 21:03:15]  <Saladofstones> sort of like having an NCO bumped down to rank and file

[04-Jan-2014 21:06:52]  <Alicia> How many traits should we have. The PDF has listed five. It just depends right?
[04-Jan-2014 21:07:04]  <SpruceZeus> while riding a tiny dragon
[04-Jan-2014 21:07:06]  <IllFlower> Alicia: use all your dice, that's about it.
[04-Jan-2014 21:07:26]  <Alicia> Okay.
[04-Jan-2014 21:07:29]  <IllFlower> you can split 3d6 into 1d6 2d6 or 1d6 1d6 1d6 or whateve.
[04-Jan-2014 21:07:35]  <Saladofstones> oh
[04-Jan-2014 21:07:43]  <Alicia> oh, hm.
[04-Jan-2014 21:07:45]  <Saladofstones> so 1d6 "Has a strong sense of prservation"
[04-Jan-2014 21:08:02]  <IllFlower> you just can't mix die sizes in a single trait, so 1d6 1d8 is verboten.
[04-Jan-2014 21:08:06]  <Barcodrawing> Nitya: need a witch idea
[04-Jan-2014 21:08:12]  <Barcodrawing> er, as in, demon

[04-Jan-2014 21:12:51]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: I'm confused, if I split a 1d6, I can't split it into two 1d3s?
[04-Jan-2014 21:13:10]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: no, you can split *before* the d but not after
[04-Jan-2014 21:13:16]  <Saladofstones> okay I got that

[04-Jan-2014 21:13:53]  <Saladofstones> I figure going with the detective theme, 2d10 could be something related to her previous affinity as a investigator of sorts
[04-Jan-2014 21:13:58]  <Saladofstones> I don't know how to word that
[04-Jan-2014 21:13:59]  <IllFlower> the latter wouldn't work if this were a physical game, you can't saw d6s in half to get d3s
[04-Jan-2014 21:14:15]  <Saladofstones> beyond a blass "She's good at investigating shit."
[04-Jan-2014 21:14:20]  <IllFlower> "sleuth 2d10"
[04-Jan-2014 21:14:22]  <ponicalica> Besides, you wouldn't want to split a d6 into d3s even if you could, since the way the rules work you want to have as much numbers in as few dice as possible

[04-Jan-2014 21:14:48]  <Barcodrawing> IF's right, you don't have to be super specific. people'll stop you if they think it doesn't work or whatever
[04-Jan-2014 21:14:54]  <Barcodrawing> it's very non-gamist

[04-Jan-2014 21:15:19]  <Alicia> I'm being all descriptive because it helps, and I think it's vague enough to work. ¬.¬;
[04-Jan-2014 21:15:20]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: is your character related to Fiora's old MB character? haha
[04-Jan-2014 21:15:23]  <Alicia> helps me*
[04-Jan-2014 21:15:38]  <Alicia> And also I think it makes sense to the traits.
[04-Jan-2014 21:15:40]  <Saladofstones> All I remember about Fiora's Mb character is that Snezana couldn't into communication with her

[04-Jan-2014 21:15:57]  <IllFlower> her last name was "Tsukino" as well.
[04-Jan-2014 21:16:08]  <Saladofstones> well hibiki means resonance
[04-Jan-2014 21:16:13]  <Saladofstones> I felt tsukino sounded nice with that meaning
[04-Jan-2014 21:16:17]  <ponicalica> Wasn't "Tsukino" also Sailor Moon's last name?
[04-Jan-2014 21:16:46]  <IllFlower> well, "Tsukino" is homophonous with "of the moon", so
[04-Jan-2014 21:17:21]  <ponicalica> "Usagi Tsukino (月野 うさぎ Tsukino Usagi?)"
[04-Jan-2014 21:17:22]  <ponicalica> so yeah
[04-Jan-2014 21:17:40]  <Barcodrawing> lol
[04-Jan-2014 21:17:45]  <Alicia> I shortened my descriptions.
[04-Jan-2014 21:17:50]  <IllFlower> pretty damn obvious reference to that one Chinese myth
[04-Jan-2014 21:17:51]  <Saladofstones> >rabbit of the moon
[04-Jan-2014 21:18:02]  <Saladofstones> so she's princess Kaguya?
[04-Jan-2014 21:18:49]  <Rig> 3d6 in oppurtunistic?
[04-Jan-2014 21:18:57]  <SpruceZeus> omg Fiora xD
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:02]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: iirc she's literally a moon princess so
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:02]  <Rig> You can split those up, Alicia.
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:16]  <Saladofstones> so she'
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:17]  <Rig> You don't have to assign all your dice of one size to one trait.
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:19]  <Saladofstones> so she's aruceid?
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:28]  <Alicia> Should I? :x
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:33]  <Barcodrawing> If you want.
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:37]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: I'd imagine you'd want traits
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:43]  <Alicia> Right, yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:45]  <Saladofstones> so would 4d4 be good or bad to keep together?
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:52]  <Alicia> I'll just 2d6 it then.
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:57]  <Alicia> 1d6 into somethng else.
[04-Jan-2014 21:19:57]  <IllFlower> pretty bad.
[04-Jan-2014 21:20:06]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: 4d4 means that this sort trait tends to make things drastically worse for your madoker.
[04-Jan-2014 21:20:12]  <ponicalica> a 4d4 is basically a crippling flaw
[04-Jan-2014 21:20:16]  <Rig> It helps to have about 4 or 5 traits to start.
[04-Jan-2014 21:20:31]  <IllFlower> small dice like d4s increase the probability of taking negative lng-erm effects.
[04-Jan-2014 21:20:57]  <Saladofstones> well
[04-Jan-2014 21:21:04]  <Saladofstones> would "lack empathy" fit as a trait?
[04-Jan-2014 21:21:09]  <Barcodrawing> yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 21:21:10]  <Alicia> Madoker, heehee.
[04-Jan-2014 21:21:16]  <Saladofstones> wait actually sociopathic might work better
[04-Jan-2014 21:21:39]  <Barcodrawing> well, apathetic might be a better thing to play, sociopathic would have probably brought up flags for the conservator organization earlier
[04-Jan-2014 21:21:49]  <Alicia> Wow you are one cold person. Tsukino and Hiiragi are going to get along wonderfully.
[04-Jan-2014 21:22:13]  <Saladofstones> how about an apathetic sociopath?
[04-Jan-2014 21:22:31]  <Barcodrawing> probably wouldn't have made it far as a doker
[04-Jan-2014 21:22:35]  <Alicia> "I don't hate them, man, I just don't, like, care if they die, man."
[04-Jan-2014 21:22:41]  <Alicia> "Man."
[04-Jan-2014 21:23:08]  <Barcodrawing> unless you turned outto be insanely good at fightin' evil or whatever. but that might imply some sort of motivation, which apathetic works against
[04-Jan-2014 21:23:15]  <Saladofstones> Barcodrawing: being a sociopath wouldn't be readly apparant
[04-Jan-2014 21:23:50]  <IllFlower> yeah, the Order isn't really one for promoting those with an obvious antipathy for the people they're supposed to be serving.
[04-Jan-2014 21:24:57]  <IllFlower> if you play it as "doesn't care a whole lot about the people she's not assigned to help," then it might work. but the critical diffeence is that she'd be apathetic, not cold.
[04-Jan-2014 21:25:12]  <Alicia> "See no evil, hear no evil."?

[04-Jan-2014 21:26:12]  <Rig> Alicia: So, all I'm getting from your character is that you are incredibly dedicated to being a meduka.
[04-Jan-2014 21:26:13]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@181.135.145.82> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[04-Jan-2014 21:26:20]  <Saladofstones> My idea was that she is willing to overlook bad things that happen to other people
[04-Jan-2014 21:26:24]  <Saladofstones> either because of her actinos or others
[04-Jan-2014 21:26:35]  <Rig> You can include traits that aren't related to being magical or fighting.
[04-Jan-2014 21:26:49]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: yeah, that's fine, "sociopath" is a bit strong, though.
[04-Jan-2014 21:26:51]  <Saladofstones> but she is borderline obsessive to any task she dedicates herself
[04-Jan-2014 21:27:02]  <IllFlower> "indifferent to the consequences of her actions" might be a better way to put it.
[04-Jan-2014 21:27:13]  <Saladofstones> SEP-fielder it is
[04-Jan-2014 21:27:22]  <Alicia> Well, as I see it these aren't just things that could be for madokers. I could be not use to conflict and react badly whether it's verbal or physical.
[04-Jan-2014 21:27:27]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: hahaha.
[04-Jan-2014 21:27:50]  <Alicia> And the goal of helping others could reaaally be applied to a whole bunch of stuff.
[04-Jan-2014 21:28:19]  <Alicia> From just going pointlessly out of the way to helping some kid to, well, being a dedicated madoker.
[04-Jan-2014 21:28:28]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: it could be like ned's flaw in GoT
[04-Jan-2014 21:28:36]  <Saladofstones> he believes everyone more or less thinks the same way, or should
[04-Jan-2014 21:28:42]  <IllFlower> that is stepping on Rig's feet a little bit, I think
[04-Jan-2014 21:28:44]  <Saladofstones> so you think everyhone has good in them, even it if tdoesn't apply
[04-Jan-2014 21:28:59]  <Alicia> Is that at me IF.
[04-Jan-2014 21:29:03]  <Rig> And yeah, your character reads a lot like Jun.
[04-Jan-2014 21:29:07]  <IllFlower> since his character also has the "goes out of her way to save people" bit.
[04-Jan-2014 21:29:07]  <Alicia> Crap. :x
[04-Jan-2014 21:29:18]  <Alicia> Unintentional.
[04-Jan-2014 21:29:21]  <Rig> A less experienced version of Jun.
[04-Jan-2014 21:29:28]  <Alicia> Yeah, my bad.
[04-Jan-2014 21:29:40]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: Could a trait relate to her circumstances that led to her status as a sacrifical limb?
[04-Jan-2014 21:29:49]  <Saladofstones> I figure it would be something that would relate to her general character at this stage
[04-Jan-2014 21:29:55]  * Alicia thinks.
[04-Jan-2014 21:30:01]  <IllFlower> if you want to play this as the opposite side of the same coin, you could have Hikari be willing to put herself in harm's way in an *offensive* fashion. Jun is mostly defense, far as I know.
[04-Jan-2014 21:30:23]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: You could be a knight templar kind of person, eliminating those who don't conform to your values
[04-Jan-2014 21:30:26]  <Alicia> Well, yeah, offense is always what I've had in mind.
[04-Jan-2014 21:30:27]  <Rig> Well, I wanted to play her defensive, but that kind of fell apart at the end of the first episode.
[04-Jan-2014 21:30:35]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: you could, or you could have that as a relationship as well.
[04-Jan-2014 21:30:43]  <Rig> I've talked to IllFlower about where I want the character to go from here though.
[04-Jan-2014 21:30:48]  <IllFlower> Rig: well, she kinda went crazy.
[04-Jan-2014 21:30:52]  <Rig> Yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 21:31:04]  <Rig> Anyway, traits are how you fight.
[04-Jan-2014 21:31:09]  <Rig> Relationships are what you fight for.
[04-Jan-2014 21:31:28]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 21:31:37]  <Alicia> Also, yeah, this conservator business could be a way to catapult into truuuuuly helping people, that sort of business.
[04-Jan-2014 21:31:40]  <Saladofstones> well she believes that there is a reason that everything happened
[04-Jan-2014 21:31:50]  <Saladofstones> for everything in life
[04-Jan-2014 21:31:51]  <Rig> But like the book says you can always add traits that don't seem to affect anything.
[04-Jan-2014 21:31:56]  <Rig> "She wears glasses"
[04-Jan-2014 21:31:58]  <Rig> can be a trait
[04-Jan-2014 21:31:58]  <Alicia> If traits are how you fight, can I put down that I'm awesome with an axe.
[04-Jan-2014 21:32:02]  <Rig> As long as it matters.
[04-Jan-2014 21:32:09]  <ponicalica> Alicia: eh, that'd be more weapon
[04-Jan-2014 21:32:15]  <ponicalica> Alicia: having an axe as your megucal wepon
[04-Jan-2014 21:32:19]  <Alicia> All right, wait for later then.
[04-Jan-2014 21:32:22]  <Alicia> Just checking. ^^;
[04-Jan-2014 21:32:33]  <Rig> Also, fighting in dogs isn't always physical.
[04-Jan-2014 21:32:38]  <IllFlower> Alicia: I'm mostly worried about the fact that your traits don't seem to have a whole lot of dimension to them, so there's not a lot of room for defining your character's internal lines.
[04-Jan-2014 21:32:48]  <Rig> So it's nice to have traits that you can pull in for talking or stuff.
[04-Jan-2014 21:33:00]  <Saladofstones> 1d4: nerd for soviet history
[04-Jan-2014 21:33:02]  <Rig> I hope IllFlower includes more talking conflicts.
[04-Jan-2014 21:33:03]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: well, no, she could just be good with axes in general. "good with a gun" is also a trait.
[04-Jan-2014 21:33:10]  <ponicalica> true
[04-Jan-2014 21:33:24]  <Alicia> Yeah, I'm having trouble working through how to flesh them out but not too much, IllFlower. ¬.¬
[04-Jan-2014 21:33:39]  <ponicalica> Also remember that you can add seemingly irrelevant things.
[04-Jan-2014 21:33:40]  <IllFlower> Rig: Hibiki's magical power is actually the ability to control minds through sound
[04-Jan-2014 21:33:45]  <Alicia> Should I start describing a lot like Saladofstones is doing?
[04-Jan-2014 21:33:50]  <ponicalica> I used singing for healing Jun, for example.
[04-Jan-2014 21:33:59]  <Saladofstones> I'm basing what I did off what illflower did for NPCs
[04-Jan-2014 21:34:03]  <Saladofstones> I figure this is a rough guideline
[04-Jan-2014 21:34:07]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: "weakness for anyone who looks vaguely Eastern European d4"
[04-Jan-2014 21:34:22]  <Rig> Well, like, my traits are all a sentence.
[04-Jan-2014 21:34:32]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@181.135.145.82> has joined #madokamadness
[04-Jan-2014 21:34:32]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: Isn't there a term for japanese women who want gaijin?
[04-Jan-2014 21:34:33]  <Rig> I don't think they need to be described because they tell their own story.
[04-Jan-2014 21:34:43]  <Rig> And if I want to spit more detail into them I can make it up on the spot.
[04-Jan-2014 21:34:57]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: yeah, I don't know it off the top of my head, though
[04-Jan-2014 21:35:04]  <Barcodrawing> westernboo
[04-Jan-2014 21:35:44]  <IllFlower> "likes sea shanties" // hahahahaha
[04-Jan-2014 21:35:45]  <Saladofstones> "1d4: Likes sea shanties"
[04-Jan-2014 21:35:50]  <Barcodrawing> lol.
[04-Jan-2014 21:36:19]  <Barcodrawing> Nitya: finishing some lettering. are you ready for this shit
[04-Jan-2014 21:36:20]  <Saladofstones> it seems like I mitigated potential negative traits though
[04-Jan-2014 21:36:21]  <Saladofstones> but I like this
[04-Jan-2014 21:36:35]  <Saladofstones> I want to see how sea shanties tie into the plot
[04-Jan-2014 21:36:54]  <Barcodrawing> i bet my japanese printing is better than my english printing
[04-Jan-2014 21:36:56]  <Rig> ponicalica's character has a "maybe plot related" key
[04-Jan-2014 21:37:00]  <Alicia> "1d8 Likes pens a lot"
[04-Jan-2014 21:37:04]  <IllFlower> oh, yeah, neither of you have "Conservator" as a trait. it's not necessarily a problem, since you can have it as a relationship too, but there's a bit of a nuance there
[04-Jan-2014 21:37:09]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: careful there. You Are Not Your Character.
[04-Jan-2014 21:37:15]  <Alicia> I'm being silly.
[04-Jan-2014 21:37:39]  <Alicia> I want to put Conservator as a trait…
[04-Jan-2014 21:37:44]  <Barcodrawing> ッシ --> god, how do you tell these apart on paper
[04-Jan-2014 21:37:46]  <IllFlower> as a trait, being a Conservator is something your character fights *with*, whether she just relishes the power or whatever
[04-Jan-2014 21:37:57]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: I think it would be stronger as a relationship
[04-Jan-2014 21:38:03]  <Saladofstones> since the whole thing that happened
[04-Jan-2014 21:38:12]  <Barcodrawing> heh, he could have it as his d4 thing
[04-Jan-2014 21:38:17]  <IllFlower> as a relationship, your character essentially fights *for* the Conservators, maybe in defense of the institution
[04-Jan-2014 21:38:23]  <Barcodrawing> goes for sword kill, realizes he's gonna get probated again, whiffs
[04-Jan-2014 21:38:34]  <Rig> As a d4 it could be an interesting relationship.
[04-Jan-2014 21:38:35]  <Saladofstones> >well I might as well
[04-Jan-2014 21:38:53]  <Saladofstones> Rig: I have no d4s
[04-Jan-2014 21:38:57]  <Saladofstones> unless I can do something special
[04-Jan-2014 21:39:40]  <IllFlower> hold on before we get too far into relationships, though
[04-Jan-2014 21:39:46]  <IllFlower> Alicia's still working on her traits.
[04-Jan-2014 21:39:56]  <Alicia> 1d8 Arrogant and is fairly presumptuous about things get done (despite being a newb).
[04-Jan-2014 21:40:06]  <Rig> Is that a benefit?
[04-Jan-2014 21:40:07]  <Alicia> Yeah I didn't realize I was so much like Jun, sorry. >_<
[04-Jan-2014 21:40:15]  <Saladofstones> I think overestimating your own abilities would be fun
[04-Jan-2014 21:40:22]  <Saladofstones> you sound so confident, others buy into it
[04-Jan-2014 21:40:28]  <Saladofstones> but if you have to back it up, things fall apart
[04-Jan-2014 21:40:30]  <Alicia> Pretty much.
[04-Jan-2014 21:40:38]  <ponicalica> Rig: The Dogs manual says it should be possible to play it as a benefit, but does Alicia want to do that?
[04-Jan-2014 21:40:43]  <IllFlower> that'd be one way to play it as a d8, "good at projecting confidence"
[04-Jan-2014 21:40:51]  <Rig> Yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 21:40:56]  <Alicia> Especially given that, well, she fears conflict.

[04-Jan-2014 21:41:04]  <IllFlower> if you're emphasizing the arrogance falling apart, though, that's more d4 material
[04-Jan-2014 21:41:09]  <Alicia> So I'm projecting it even though I'm kind of really noooot.
[04-Jan-2014 21:41:21]  <IllFlower> Alicia: yeah, you have a point, that d4 arguably is already there
[04-Jan-2014 21:41:32]  <Alicia> 1d8 Readily projects confidence (not necessarily *is*)?

[04-Jan-2014 21:41:45]  <Saladofstones> I just want a scene of my character trying to karoako old sea shanties
[04-Jan-2014 21:41:54]  <IllFlower> Alicia: "sounds like she knows what she's doing d8; doesn't actually d4"
[04-Jan-2014 21:42:22]  <Barcodrawing> hah, that's good
[04-Jan-2014 21:42:24]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: hmm
[04-Jan-2014 21:42:27]  <Barcodrawing> especially if on the sheet tehy're one after another
[04-Jan-2014 21:42:47]  <Saladofstones> would my character being an expierenced fixer be better as a trait or as a relationship?
[04-Jan-2014 21:42:53]  <Saladofstones> since that might be fun with alicia's character
[04-Jan-2014 21:43:06]  <Saladofstones> "This is how this works" "No it doesn't you idiot I've been doing this forever"
[04-Jan-2014 21:43:20]  <Alicia> "TRY IT THIS WAY ANYWAY TO STUBBORN DICK."
[04-Jan-2014 21:43:29]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: that'd probably be more of a trait
[04-Jan-2014 21:43:47]  <IllFlower> since in that case the Conservatorship is something she leverages in conflict rather than something that motivates her to it
[04-Jan-2014 21:44:01]  <IllFlower> not that you should be in conflict with each other a whole lot >_>

[04-Jan-2014 21:44:31]  <Alicia> Could be both.
[04-Jan-2014 21:44:48]  <Barcodrawing> it smells like wet dust downstairs.
[04-Jan-2014 21:44:56]  <IllFlower> yeah, that's fine as long as it doesn't tangle up actually playing the game
[04-Jan-2014 21:44:58]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: Wakahisa might be a fun surname
[04-Jan-2014 21:45:12]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: yeah I learned from snezana how not to disrupt tangling up the game

[04-Jan-2014 21:46:15]  <Barcodrawing> ???
[04-Jan-2014 21:46:23]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: cool. if you do intend to use Conservatorship in that way in conflict more generally, though, it'd definitely be best as a trait
[04-Jan-2014 21:46:31]  <Saladofstones> I think that was aya hirano's catchphrase
[04-Jan-2014 21:46:37]  <Saladofstones> it was some seiyuu's catchphrase
[04-Jan-2014 21:46:41]  <IllFlower> Kikuko Inoue
[04-Jan-2014 21:47:05]  <Saladofstones> Illflower I include it as conflict because of history
[04-Jan-2014 21:47:06]  <Alicia> Maybe opportunistic could be changed to something abouw how she'll readily manipulate others if need be? More descriptive, and not totally unusual for anyone placed in uncertain circumstances.
[04-Jan-2014 21:47:23]  <Saladofstones> and because I see her as someone who would be of that mindset to use it as leverage
[04-Jan-2014 21:47:32]  <IllFlower> Alicia: "manipulative" then?
[04-Jan-2014 21:47:32]  <Saladofstones> "well I'm a conservator, you better watch your mouth bub"
[04-Jan-2014 21:47:37]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 21:47:43]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: Manipulative, sensitive soul
[04-Jan-2014 21:47:46]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: yeah, that sounds a lot like how Barcodrawing used it
[04-Jan-2014 21:47:55]  <Alicia> Yes, Saladofstones. :p
[04-Jan-2014 21:48:02]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: (this is not a bad thing)
[04-Jan-2014 21:48:08]  <Saladofstones> hey barcodrawing are you still in the game?
[04-Jan-2014 21:48:14]  <IllFlower> actually, your d6 trait sounds a hell of a lot like what a Conservator trait would be already
[04-Jan-2014 21:48:18]  <Barcodrawing> naw. not for the forseeable future
[04-Jan-2014 21:48:22]  <Saladofstones> god damnit it
[04-Jan-2014 21:48:36]  <Saladofstones> "hey this other meguca is retired, so have this meguca who is exactly like her.":
[04-Jan-2014 21:48:37]  <Barcodrawing> i don't like roleplaying. i could probably do one-offs but not this sorta stuff
[04-Jan-2014 21:48:42]  <IllFlower> "delinquent hour with Hibiki and Hitomi"
[04-Jan-2014 21:48:47]  <Barcodrawing> Saladofstones: oh not necessarily
[04-Jan-2014 21:48:56]  <Saladofstones> which 1d6 trait?
[04-Jan-2014 21:49:00]  <Alicia> Mine, IllFlower? Then could I change it to immovably believing in goodness?
[04-Jan-2014 21:49:06]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: "I've been doing this forever"
[04-Jan-2014 21:49:11]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 21:49:17]  <Alicia> Oh, you didn't mean mine.
[04-Jan-2014 21:49:21]  <Alicia> Whoops.
[04-Jan-2014 21:49:23]  <Saladofstones> how about editing it to the idea that she is going to hold onto her position?
[04-Jan-2014 21:49:29]  <Saladofstones> basically "I really like this job"
[04-Jan-2014 21:49:51]  <IllFlower> that works, what you already have works, whatever
[04-Jan-2014 21:50:08]  <IllFlower> the game does require that your being a Conservator comes out somehow in either a trait or a relationship, that's all
[04-Jan-2014 21:50:34]  <Alicia> Jun still sounds a lot more defensive than I ever intnd for.
[04-Jan-2014 21:50:41]  <Alicia> Whether it's verbal or whatever.
[04-Jan-2014 21:50:43]  <ponicalica> 13:48:23 < Saladofstones> god damnit it <---Depending on what IllFlower and Barcodrawing want to do it's possible Hitomi returns for like one later episode

[04-Jan-2014 21:51:09]  <Saladofstones> Barcodrawing: you're art has improved
[04-Jan-2014 21:51:16]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@181.135.63.218> has joined #madokamadness
[04-Jan-2014 21:51:24]  <Saladofstones> although it seems like the guy is the "the best part of winning is letting others know that I won"
[04-Jan-2014 21:51:32]  <Barcodrawing> i did a very bad job of drawing will smith.
[04-Jan-2014 21:51:36]  <Alicia> Heh.
[04-Jan-2014 21:51:40]  <IllFlower> "Bel Air no Fresh na Wizard!!"
[04-Jan-2014 21:51:53]  <Alicia> Fears conflict… but is sensitive to emotions.
[04-Jan-2014 21:52:01]  <Barcodrawing> IllFlower: i was looking at the translation result and i saw "Beruea no furesshuna" and i kind of just laughed
[04-Jan-2014 21:52:03]  <Alicia> Yeah not totally contradictory.
[04-Jan-2014 21:52:05]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: i figure its sort of like someone who can dish more than they take
[04-Jan-2014 21:52:14]  <Saladofstones> sort of like ashton kutcher when he got punk'd and freaked out
[04-Jan-2014 21:52:17]  <Saladofstones> you are now meguca kutcher
[04-Jan-2014 21:52:22]  <Alicia> Yeah, especially if you're a newbie.
[04-Jan-2014 21:52:26]  <IllFlower> well, damn, Barcodrawing, you have those weird loanwords-with-Japanese-grammar titles down
[04-Jan-2014 21:52:35]  <Barcodrawing> IllFlower: i'm good at titling!
[04-Jan-2014 21:53:13]  <IllFlower> Alicia: now that sounds like ponicalica's character /ducks
[04-Jan-2014 21:53:31]  <Alicia> Gee dee eye.
[04-Jan-2014 21:53:56]  <Alicia> I keep *looking* at Jun and Ayako and trying *not* to end up like them at aaaaalll.
[04-Jan-2014 21:54:37]  <Alicia> 1d8 Enjoys conflict oh wait no I fear it hurgrr.
[04-Jan-2014 21:54:59]  <IllFlower> we are lacking for a flashy extroverted character but that'd require pitching basically everything
[04-Jan-2014 21:54:59]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: i like the idea of "also noob but jumps into things and is more just combatty than magicky" re not wanting to be ayako
[04-Jan-2014 21:55:21]  <Barcodrawing> fights going badly when you get into them doesn't necessarily mean you wouldn't enjoy getting into them.
[04-Jan-2014 21:55:22]  <Alicia> Well I don't want magix.
[04-Jan-2014 21:55:40]  <Alicia> And Hikari would enjoy them, yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 21:55:44]  <Barcodrawing> maybe like, combat magic is more of an art while other magic/special magics are studying-based stuff
[04-Jan-2014 21:55:54]  <Alicia> How can I word these in ways that make them not sound like Jun or Ayako.
[04-Jan-2014 21:56:18]  <Saladofstones> "I like punchign things"
[04-Jan-2014 21:56:31]  <IllFlower> well, the way I see it is "Ayako's the academic, Hikari's the practitioner."
[04-Jan-2014 21:56:33]  <Alicia> Because yeah, Barcodrawing, have more thought about combativeness and just enjoying it.
[04-Jan-2014 21:56:39]  <Barcodrawing> ^^
[04-Jan-2014 21:56:41]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 21:56:53]  <Alicia> 1d8 Gets a rush from conflict?
[04-Jan-2014 21:57:17]  <Alicia> Though could be kind of conflicted about conflict, what with *trying* to help people…
[04-Jan-2014 21:57:22]  <Alicia> >_>
[04-Jan-2014 21:57:36]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: it could be a thing that you like fighting, but you can't deal with the reality of it
[04-Jan-2014 21:57:36]  <Barcodrawing> you can fight people and still want to help them. "it's for your own good," etc.
[04-Jan-2014 21:57:47]  <Saladofstones> sort of like you like shooters but don't like real war
[04-Jan-2014 21:58:07]  <Barcodrawing> or even like, fistfights instead of knife fights
[04-Jan-2014 21:58:08]  <IllFlower> "I know you might not *enjoy* having your limbs torn off, but I'm telling you, it's for your own good"
[04-Jan-2014 21:58:18]  <Barcodrawing> @yt alice cooper - backyard brawl

[04-Jan-2014 21:58:31]  <Saladofstones> While Alicia is ripping off arms, she's crying "I HATE RIPPING OFF ARMS"
[04-Jan-2014 21:58:36]  <Saladofstones> "BUT I ALSO LOVE IT"
[04-Jan-2014 21:58:40]  <Barcodrawing> lol
[04-Jan-2014 21:58:43]  <Alicia> Yep.
[04-Jan-2014 21:58:56]  <IllFlower> "and the man in the back said 'everyone attack!' and it turned into a ballroom blitz"
[04-Jan-2014 21:59:12]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: if you want to go into the dysfunctional, why not go highschool of the dead i.e. get a sexual high from conflict for various reasons
[04-Jan-2014 21:59:30]  <Saladofstones> but get that sort of nasty post-fight feeling and you need tissues
[04-Jan-2014 21:59:54]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: Look around, feel the heat, the blood flows out, beneath your fet"
[04-Jan-2014 21:59:55]  <Saladofstones> feet*
[04-Jan-2014 22:00:04]  <Saladofstones> aslso fuck you illflower for getting that stuck in my head
[04-Jan-2014 22:00:26]  <Alicia> It doesn't have to sexual, Saladofstones, but it could just be some vague sort of high.
[04-Jan-2014 22:00:38]  <Saladofstones> but we're urobutcher
[04-Jan-2014 22:00:39]  <Alicia> Like, yeah, just a high/rush from it sounds acceptable.
[04-Jan-2014 22:00:45]  <Saladofstones> we have to go maximum dysfunction
[04-Jan-2014 22:00:51]  <Alicia> IT CAN BE ANY HIGH, SALAD.
[04-Jan-2014 22:00:53]  <IllFlower> Alicia: but if you're worried about being too similar to ponicalica and Rig in your character, I think one elemental thing is that both of their characters aren't really ones to jump at conflict
[04-Jan-2014 22:01:07]  <Saladofstones> yeah and I think the lack of expierence opens up a lot of developments
[04-Jan-2014 22:01:16]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@181.135.63.218> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 380 seconds)
[04-Jan-2014 22:01:42]  <Alicia> Jump at conflict as in what to be exact.
[04-Jan-2014 22:01:50]  <Rig> Yeah, and now you have a weird thing where you fear conflict but enjoy it.
[04-Jan-2014 22:01:51]  <Barcodrawing> someone trheatens the group, you've already punched them
[04-Jan-2014 22:01:52]  <Alicia> Jump away, or won't jump into conflict.
[04-Jan-2014 22:02:04]  <Saladofstones> I think it could work
[04-Jan-2014 22:02:08]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 22:02:10]  <Saladofstones> but it would require a very specific backstory
[04-Jan-2014 22:02:12]  <Saladofstones> or something
[04-Jan-2014 22:02:13]  <Barcodrawing> it's not hard! you're opportunistic, you're aggressive, someone gives you a reason to hit 'em you hit 'em.
[04-Jan-2014 22:02:24]  <Alicia> For their own good you jerk.
[04-Jan-2014 22:02:25]  <Barcodrawing> it won't really throw off the game if you're worried about that.
[04-Jan-2014 22:02:31]  <Saladofstones> Barcodrawing:I think the problem is more intrisic than just being opportunistic
[04-Jan-2014 22:02:48]  <Alicia> Everyone can be helped and everyone will be helped, god damn it.
[04-Jan-2014 22:02:49]  <Saladofstones> I think there might be a thing of not wanting to get -hurt- or something, or not liking something that goes against a black-white view
[04-Jan-2014 22:03:00]  <Saladofstones> i.e. a criminal who has reasons to be a criminal
[04-Jan-2014 22:03:07]  <Saladofstones> or has a kid or something
[04-Jan-2014 22:03:14]  <Saladofstones> basically cognitive dissonance is what I'm seeing
[04-Jan-2014 22:03:19]  <Barcodrawing> The other thing is that basically the amount of Hits you take in-game is basically your character deciding how much they care about a conflict versus how much energy they've got in reserve.
[04-Jan-2014 22:03:37]  <ponicalica> I feel like Hikari might be even more golden-child-ish than Ayako is
[04-Jan-2014 22:03:39]  <Barcodrawing> so like "is afraid of conflict", unless you think it woudl directly interfere with you fighting in a conflict, is something you RP rather than have a sa stat.
[04-Jan-2014 22:03:41]  <IllFlower> Alicia: or since Hikari's already "manipulative", if you want to keep the reluctance to conflict you could have her prefer to play other people so that conflict is rarely necessary
[04-Jan-2014 22:03:58]  <Alicia> No, yeah, I was thinking that Hikari mostly has a bunch of built up inner tension and this is *the* way to finally actually change people's lives for the better.
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:06]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: kind of like a person not liking getting their hands dirty?
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:13]  <Alicia> Wait, so change 2d6 or 1d4, IllFlower.
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:16]  <Saladofstones> but ti seems like she's pretty into being in the middle of things and impulsive
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:21]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: yeah, pretty much, or at least not liking getting caught with their hands dirty
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:21]  <Saladofstones> I'm not sure if being manipulative works
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:26]  <Barcodrawing> i should apologize, i lost  track of things and thought you were still playing someone super go-getter-y.
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:36]  <Saladofstones> unless it goes into that "overestimates their manipulative ability"
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:39]  <Barcodrawing> do not underestimate the power of the getter
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:44]  <Alicia> Well, I am more go-gettery than Jun or Ayako, Barcodrawing.
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:50]  <Alicia> I think.
[04-Jan-2014 22:04:55]  <Alicia> They are the defensive ones.
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:12]  <Rig> Well, Ayako is uncertain.
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:16]  <Rig> Jun is defensive.
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:16]  <Barcodrawing> well i mean, are you afraid of playing a character that's /particularly/ like that, or do you just not want to?
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:17]  <ponicalica> well, Ayako's current arc is mostly about getting over her fear and such
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:22]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking "someone who would be voiced by Akira Ishida"
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:36]  <Saladofstones> @g akira ishida
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:36]  <Omnipresence> 14Saladofstones: Google: (1/4) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Ishida — Akira Ishida - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: Akira Ishida (石田 彰, Ishida Akira, born November 2, 1967 in Nisshin, Aichi, Japan) is a Japanese voice actor. He was a part of Mausu (+793 more characters)
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:54]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: uryuu megucka would be fun
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:55]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@181.135.151.28> has joined #madokamadness
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:57]  <Alicia> I don't mind, Barcodrawing. :x
[04-Jan-2014 22:05:58]  <IllFlower> I think he played Kaworu.
[04-Jan-2014 22:06:04]  <Saladofstones> he also was togami
[04-Jan-2014 22:06:13]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: My three reference points for Akira Ishida are Byakuya Togami, Kaworu Nagisa, and Uryuu Ryuunosuke (serial killer in F/0).  You're going to have to be more specific.
[04-Jan-2014 22:06:15]  <IllFlower> oh, yeah, that's right.
[04-Jan-2014 22:06:24]  <Barcodrawing> SpruceZeus: not that i like thinking about it but this is what i imagine you were thinking about with your doker http://ogch.deviantart.com/art/01-261787927

[04-Jan-2014 22:06:27]  <Saladofstones> oh he was gaara as well
[04-Jan-2014 22:06:27]  <Alicia> I just remember IF saying that Jun is more defensive and whatnot.
[04-Jan-2014 22:06:36]  <Alicia> Also something about Ayako.
[04-Jan-2014 22:06:45]  <Alicia> When I didn't have that stuff in mind for Hikari.
[04-Jan-2014 22:06:47]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: why not kirei's VA?
[04-Jan-2014 22:06:55]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: Nakata?
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:00]  <Alicia> And it doesn't make sense to be defensive if you'll readily play with people.
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:04]  <Saladofstones> Rejoice alicia, you're dream will finally come true
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:14]  <Saladofstones> "
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:14]  <Alicia> What dream.
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:14]  <Saladofstones> Angel Beats! (The Guy in Second Computer Room)" lawl
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:21]  <Saladofstones> of being a magical serial killer
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:24]  <ponicalica> Alicia: he's quating fate stay night
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:28]  <Alicia> Oh, lol.
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:30]  <IllFlower> well, no, I was going in the direction of manipulativeness, Ishida has a tendency to play those characters where you can never tell whether they're working for or against you
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:38]  <Alicia> Oh.
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:41]  <Alicia> NBD.
[04-Jan-2014 22:07:59]  <Saladofstones> >squatting
[04-Jan-2014 22:08:10]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: Well kirei is basically that to a tee
[04-Jan-2014 22:08:15]  <Rig> Barcodrawing: I've made the mistake of entering into a game with a bunch of fucking weebs.
[04-Jan-2014 22:08:17]  <Saladofstones> not even kirei knows whose side he's own bhy the end
[04-Jan-2014 22:08:32]  <Barcodrawing> Rig: yeah i'm kind of just going < _ > as japanese names get thrown around, with increasing spaces between _ and the eyes
[04-Jan-2014 22:08:34]  <Alicia> Excuse me, Rig, but I haven't referenced anything Japanesey.
[04-Jan-2014 22:08:50]  <Barcodrawing> Rig: didja see my fresh prince thing.
[04-Jan-2014 22:08:54]  <Rig> Yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 22:08:56]  <Barcodrawing> good.
[04-Jan-2014 22:09:01]  <Rig> You're gotten better at drawing people.
[04-Jan-2014 22:09:01]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: keep in mind that IllFlower's not seen Fate/stuff, his main interaction with Nasushit is Rakkyo(fuck you kyoani for ruining the abbrev knk)
[04-Jan-2014 22:09:19]  <Barcodrawing> shucks.
[04-Jan-2014 22:09:24]  <Alicia> Anyway, are my traits fine?
[04-Jan-2014 22:09:46]  <Saladofstones> Ponicalica: if he doesn't like nakata, he deserves to die
[04-Jan-2014 22:09:49]  <Rig> I like that you believe in the good of other people but manipulate them.
[04-Jan-2014 22:09:55]  <Saladofstones> since he was also the buddhist monk
[04-Jan-2014 22:10:05]  <IllFlower> you're gonna have to clarify how your first and last traits aren't contradictory
[04-Jan-2014 22:10:13]  <Rig> And yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 22:10:17]  <Alicia> Right.
[04-Jan-2014 22:10:21]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: yeah but what I mean is that Araya, yeah
[04-Jan-2014 22:10:23]  <Saladofstones> perhaps enjoys conflict when its not happening with her
[04-Jan-2014 22:10:32]  <Alicia> ^ is what I had in mind.
[04-Jan-2014 22:10:35]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: and that he doesn't know what a kirei is
[04-Jan-2014 22:10:40]  <Saladofstones> wait seriously
[04-Jan-2014 22:10:54]  <Saladofstones> well when ufotable adapts Heaven's feel Illflower, you better watch it
[04-Jan-2014 22:10:59]  <Rig> Okay, then say "enjoys causing conflict" or something. Like right now it says you enjoy all conflict.
[04-Jan-2014 22:11:01]  <IllFlower> otherwise I agree with Rig on that. "I believe people are fundamentally good inside. it makes it that much easier to mess with them"

[04-Jan-2014 22:11:18]  <Alicia> Nooo.
[04-Jan-2014 22:11:18]  <Saladofstones> "can't handle being hurt" or something
[04-Jan-2014 22:11:29]  <Barcodrawing> izaya just said he liked people, but he didn't really see morality at all
[04-Jan-2014 22:11:34]  <Barcodrawing> so he just fucked with people for fun.
[04-Jan-2014 22:11:38]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: I know my way around Fate. kinda.
[04-Jan-2014 22:11:44]  <Saladofstones> wasn't someone like that in baccano?
[04-Jan-2014 22:11:50]  <Saladofstones> the guy who felt people should smile, but didn't care why

[04-Jan-2014 22:12:10]  <Saladofstones> "Doesn't like having scars"
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:15]  <Rig> What does "SEP-fielder" mean?
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:17]  <Alicia> For the record, I try to see her as a well-intentioned person, not like Izaya. :<
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:22]  <ponicalica> Rig: "someone else's problem"
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:27]  <ponicalica> Rig: hitchhiker's guide reference, I think
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:29]  <Alicia> Izaya sure "loves" humanity but he's a total asshole, we know that.
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:33]  <Barcodrawing> yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:34]  <Rig> It just reads weird.
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:39]  <Saladofstones> Rig: its a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy reference
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:47]  <Saladofstones> it has to do where SEP was related as a baseball game
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:53]  <Alicia> I know, I'm bad with words. ¬.¬;
[04-Jan-2014 22:12:55]  <Saladofstones> so SEP-fielder
[04-Jan-2014 22:13:12]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: It could be a more machivellan thing
[04-Jan-2014 22:13:35]  <Alicia> Mm.
[04-Jan-2014 22:13:49]  <Saladofstones> oh
[04-Jan-2014 22:13:53]  <Saladofstones> what was that term
[04-Jan-2014 22:13:59]  <Alicia> Awesome?
[04-Jan-2014 22:14:01]  <Saladofstones> its an elitest philosophy, but it was sort of a chaste system
[04-Jan-2014 22:14:01]  <Alicia> Wait, no.
[04-Jan-2014 22:14:10]  <Saladofstones> it was a semi-theological thing
[04-Jan-2014 22:14:19]  <Saladofstones> but basically those of power were morally superior to those below them
[04-Jan-2014 22:14:24]  <ponicalica> divine right?
[04-Jan-2014 22:14:26]  <Saladofstones> and were not bound to the same morality
[04-Jan-2014 22:14:28]  <Alicia> What, no no.
[04-Jan-2014 22:14:40]  <Saladofstones> you could have a less religious ideal of that

[04-Jan-2014 22:15:21]  <Alicia> Hikari certainly… enjoys the power, no doubt about that. She's not going to up and kill off an intern (when she's presumably past that stage) for the sake of it.
[04-Jan-2014 22:15:26]  <Alicia> They're a good person.
[04-Jan-2014 22:15:29]  <IllFlower> that is literally in the setting details.
[04-Jan-2014 22:15:32]  <Alicia> And could be helpful later on.
[04-Jan-2014 22:15:43]  <IllFlower> the whole part where some initiates believe they're superior to the uninitiated.
[04-Jan-2014 22:15:50]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: See it all comes together
[04-Jan-2014 22:16:32]  <IllFlower> you don't have to play an angel, we're not going to judge you for whatever Hikari does
[04-Jan-2014 22:16:36]  <IllFlower> (mostly, haha)
[04-Jan-2014 22:16:44]  <Saladofstones> (You're character is bad and you should feel bad)
[04-Jan-2014 22:16:54]  <Alicia> Heh, yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 22:17:00]  <Buttercupistiny> (and your grammar brings shame to your family)
[04-Jan-2014 22:17:00]  <Barcodrawing> Alicia: Yeah, above all, you're not your character.
[04-Jan-2014 22:17:19]  <Saladofstones> its a meme
[04-Jan-2014 22:17:28]  <Barcodrawing> It's unlikely you'll creep us out, Illflower makes up gross stuff reasonably often.
[04-Jan-2014 22:17:34]  <Alicia> Lol.
[04-Jan-2014 22:17:49]  <Alicia> Also ponicalica what did you mean by golden child-ish.
[04-Jan-2014 22:17:59]  <Alicia> Also I think I clarified my traits?
[04-Jan-2014 22:18:04]  <IllFlower> you have to remember, the first NPC I made in this setting literally murdered two of her best friends because of love troubles.
[04-Jan-2014 22:18:05]  <Rig> yeah, looks better
[04-Jan-2014 22:18:14]  <Saladofstones> you also have me
[04-Jan-2014 22:18:19]  <Saladofstones> miss yugoslavian war criminal
[04-Jan-2014 22:18:29]  <Alicia> Point.
[04-Jan-2014 22:18:42]  <ponicalica> Alicia: like, favored by the order and shit :V
[04-Jan-2014 22:18:52]  <IllFlower> Alicia: so I'm reading "likes conflict when she's winning, psychologically goes south when she's not"
[04-Jan-2014 22:19:09]  <Alicia> Basically.
[04-Jan-2014 22:19:36]  <Alicia> Still gets a rush even when she's not because hotheaded initiate, but that doesn't equate to automatically fixing things.
[04-Jan-2014 22:19:42]  <Alicia> Aaaand could make things worse.
[04-Jan-2014 22:20:03]  <IllFlower> lemme see if I can distill it down in the charsheet real quick
[04-Jan-2014 22:20:04]  <Barcodrawing> that could also be interesting in a d4 trait sort of way, like, you /can/ get a 4 on a d4, and in that case panicking because you realize you're not gonna win could still work to your favour.
[04-Jan-2014 22:20:25]  <IllFlower> :p
[04-Jan-2014 22:20:26]  *** SpruceZeus is now known as SpruceZeus|away

[04-Jan-2014 22:21:27]  <IllFlower> okay, I think we're done here with traits. any last-minute objections?

[04-Jan-2014 22:21:59]  <Alicia> (I'm good.)
[04-Jan-2014 22:22:07]  <Saladofstones> OBJECTION
[04-Jan-2014 22:22:12]  <Saladofstones> illflower you cannot marry that person
[04-Jan-2014 22:22:16]  <Saladofstones> but lets do relationships
[04-Jan-2014 22:23:04]  <Alicia> Relationships next right.
[04-Jan-2014 22:23:14]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@181.136.18.12> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 194 seconds)
[04-Jan-2014 22:24:18]  <Alicia> Hey ponicalica hottt picture you put up.
[04-Jan-2014 22:24:24]  <ponicalica> Alicia: hahaha
[04-Jan-2014 22:24:25]  <Alicia> But really you looking good. :3
[04-Jan-2014 22:24:31]  <Alicia> And huggable.
[04-Jan-2014 22:24:42]  <IllFlower> yeah, let's move on to relationships.
[04-Jan-2014 22:24:48]  <Saladofstones> poni put up a photo?
[04-Jan-2014 22:24:52]  <Alicia> On HH.
[04-Jan-2014 22:25:08]  <ponicalica> it's also on my tumblr so
[04-Jan-2014 22:25:13]  <Alicia> Aah.
[04-Jan-2014 22:25:48]  <Alicia> "In play you can give your character Relationships with institutions, demons, places, and even sins, but for now stick with people." Huh.
[04-Jan-2014 22:26:28]  <IllFlower> Alicia: you're going to draw a lot of your character's strength from the relationships that define her, 'swhy you have high dice for them.
[04-Jan-2014 22:26:37]  <Alicia> Cool.
[04-Jan-2014 22:27:01]  <IllFlower> note that you don't have to allocate all your dice for now. in fact the manual recommends that you only do one or two relationships to start.
[04-Jan-2014 22:27:08]  <Saladofstones> cool
[04-Jan-2014 22:27:21]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: can I have a 1d4 because of what happened in the past?
[04-Jan-2014 22:27:34]  <IllFlower> Alicia: since you don't have "Conservator" as a trait, you have to add it as a relationship. figure out how to define the parameters of that relationship.
[04-Jan-2014 22:27:48]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: yeah, we've got a couple of examples of that.
[04-Jan-2014 22:28:37]  <IllFlower> Rig's character literally has "3d4 dead boyfriend"
[04-Jan-2014 22:29:00]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 22:29:11]  <Rig> Well, he means that he doesn't have the d4.
[04-Jan-2014 22:29:11]  <Saladofstones> it seems like it might be a 2d4, I'd say 1d4 would be safer though
[04-Jan-2014 22:29:21]  <Rig> Like, I had all those dice to use.
[04-Jan-2014 22:29:22]  <Rig> He doesn't.
[04-Jan-2014 22:29:47]  <ponicalica> speaking of which I'm considering adding "1d4 Hitomi" to my relationships, though I never worked out with Barcodrawing and IllFlower how much she knows about Hitomi's reason for leaving
[04-Jan-2014 22:30:13]  <IllFlower> poor Hitomi, everyone's got issues with her
[04-Jan-2014 22:30:31]  <IllFlower> Rig: oh, oh, yeah, that's right
[04-Jan-2014 22:30:58]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: your character's background dictates that her troubles are caused more by herself than by the people around her, which is why she doesn't have any d4s for relationships.
[04-Jan-2014 22:31:07]  <Alicia> I think I'm only going to allocate one thing to her status as a conservator, and one to maybe a good mentor or something. Teachers aren't unusual. But Jun or Ayako did that.
[04-Jan-2014 22:31:13]  <Alicia> Maybe one to a pet?
[04-Jan-2014 22:31:27]  <IllFlower> "I fight for my adorably fluffy kitten d6"
[04-Jan-2014 22:31:29]  <ponicalica> Ayako did it in reference to knowledge, not to the relationship with the mentor
[04-Jan-2014 22:31:52]  <Alicia> "My mentor taught me hoe to mess crap up and not get in trouble"
[04-Jan-2014 22:31:55]  <Alicia> how*
[04-Jan-2014 22:32:01]  <IllFlower> nobody here has "BFF d8", just saying
[04-Jan-2014 22:33:38]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: another way to think of it might be that her relationships stabilize her (or give her some kind of strength); her weaknesses are more her own than they come from external circumstances.
[04-Jan-2014 22:33:58]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: so as a relationship, could I reference the conservators as a whole and the penal system she went through?
[04-Jan-2014 22:33:58]  <Alicia> So relationships are stabilizers, hm.
[04-Jan-2014 22:34:07]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: yes
[04-Jan-2014 22:34:26]  <SpruceZeus|away> Barcodrawing: idgi, what's even going on in that picture
[04-Jan-2014 22:34:27]  *** SpruceZeus|away is now known as SpruceZeus
[04-Jan-2014 22:34:31]  <Alicia> Well if you're used to messing with people, then having an animal be *one* thing that's consistent would help, right?
[04-Jan-2014 22:34:46]  <Alicia> Not even just messing with people at all, just life being wack as a conservator.
[04-Jan-2014 22:35:20]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: well, you'd have a bit of weirdness assigning a d6 or d8 relationship to that, because (1) that implies it's a source of strength (2) that implies she in a sense fights to defend it (3) she already has Conservatorship as a trait
[04-Jan-2014 22:35:38]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: I was thinking that she doesn't ever want to go there again
[04-Jan-2014 22:35:51]  <IllFlower> if she truly believes it reformed her, though, then it might work
[04-Jan-2014 22:35:55]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@182.55.188.37> has joined #madokamadness
[04-Jan-2014 22:36:22]  <Saladofstones> well she might view it as a fresh start, but it might be a more of a "i'm really not going to go back there"
[04-Jan-2014 22:36:37]  <IllFlower> fear as a motivation might be a bit dicey for d6/d8, but with the right nuance it could work.
[04-Jan-2014 22:36:58]  <Saladofstones> wasn't thinking of it as fear, but more pride
[04-Jan-2014 22:37:29]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: where is the story set in?
[04-Jan-2014 22:37:30]  <IllFlower> "I've been reinstated because I'm better than I was before"?
[04-Jan-2014 22:37:46]  <Saladofstones> "I went in because of political intrigue, I'm not going to be disgraced like that again."
[04-Jan-2014 22:37:50]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: generic large Japanese city. so basically Tokyo.
[04-Jan-2014 22:37:51]  <Saladofstones> or "I was betrayed"
[04-Jan-2014 22:38:07]  <Saladofstones> the idea is that she didn't go there to reform, but to settle a dispute and was aware of this going in
[04-Jan-2014 22:38:19]  <Saladofstones> well the involved parties as well, but its not public knowledge
[04-Jan-2014 22:38:30]  <IllFlower> yeah, that could work. "like hell I'm going through that again d8"
[04-Jan-2014 22:38:33]  <Alicia> IllFlower and Rig and ponicalica, just to clarify, what are Jun's and Ayako's stances on "improving" whatever again.
[04-Jan-2014 22:38:40]  <ponicalica> "improving"?
[04-Jan-2014 22:38:53]  <Alicia> I'm putting one relationship down as being a conservator.
[04-Jan-2014 22:39:08]  <Alicia> I thought you or Rig was all about helping others, etc.
[04-Jan-2014 22:39:18]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 22:39:23]  <Alicia> Or at least, made it a serious part of herself.
[04-Jan-2014 22:39:27]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: just as a clerical thing, you'd probably put that down as a relationship with "her betrayers" or whatever.
[04-Jan-2014 22:39:31]  <Rig> Jun is about preventing other people from getting hurt.
[04-Jan-2014 22:39:42]  <Alicia> Getting hurt, specifically. Okay.
[04-Jan-2014 22:40:01]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: Okay
[04-Jan-2014 22:40:19]  <IllFlower> we don't have anyone here who can make those cutesy anime character cards for us, what a crying shame
[04-Jan-2014 22:40:43]  <SpruceZeus> where is LORd when you need him
[04-Jan-2014 22:40:56]  <Saladofstones> did LORd ever finish that meguca burst piece?
[04-Jan-2014 22:41:19]  <ponicalica> nah.  That whole RP got completely derailed though so I think everyone else lost interest too
[04-Jan-2014 22:41:24]  <SpruceZeus> barcode! you must draw fluffy anime nonsense!
[04-Jan-2014 22:41:34]  <Saladofstones> what caused that derail anyways
[04-Jan-2014 22:41:43]  <IllFlower> everything
[04-Jan-2014 22:41:54]  <SpruceZeus> everything happens so much
[04-Jan-2014 22:42:02]  <Saladofstones> everything needs to be kicked
[04-Jan-2014 22:42:26]  <Alicia> Darn it SpruceZeus, you keep making me laugh.
[04-Jan-2014 22:42:29]  <Alicia> :v
[04-Jan-2014 22:42:34]  <SpruceZeus> :v
[04-Jan-2014 22:42:55]  <Alicia> "I love this job (Conservator), it reminds me of napalm in the morning" lol.
[04-Jan-2014 22:44:00]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: can I have a relationship with a place?
[04-Jan-2014 22:44:30]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: the manual suggests sticking with people for character creation. but what kind of place?
[04-Jan-2014 22:44:37]  <Saladofstones> Her hometown
[04-Jan-2014 22:44:58]  <Alicia> Do pet animals work too, IllFlower?
[04-Jan-2014 22:45:01]  <Saladofstones> I'm assuming that the organization has its own sections based on location? it could be until she does this job, she can't return
[04-Jan-2014 22:45:04]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: yeah, I think that's fine.
[04-Jan-2014 22:45:07]  <Alicia> Or are humans really just preferable.
[04-Jan-2014 22:45:20]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: "BUNNY AND ME BUNNY AND ME"
[04-Jan-2014 22:45:26]  <Alicia> What.
[04-Jan-2014 22:45:26]  <IllFlower> Alicia: we can pretend pets are people.
[04-Jan-2014 22:45:32]  <Alicia> Heh, okay.
[04-Jan-2014 22:45:44]  <SpruceZeus> relationship: doge
[04-Jan-2014 22:45:46]  <Saladofstones> no
[04-Jan-2014 22:45:49]  <Saladofstones> no doge jokes
[04-Jan-2014 22:46:04]  <Alicia> I forget, are you magically dogging too, SpruceZeus.
[04-Jan-2014 22:46:05]  <ponicalica> SpruceZeus: "I love that kindergarten teacher's Shiba Inu."
[04-Jan-2014 22:46:09]  <IllFlower> I think the manual suggests people just so character creation doesn't prescribe the bounds of the game too early on.
[04-Jan-2014 22:46:12]  <SpruceZeus> Alicia: no
[04-Jan-2014 22:46:18]  <Alicia> Aw. :(
[04-Jan-2014 22:46:21]  <Alicia> I see, IllFlower.

[04-Jan-2014 22:47:01]  <Alicia> Well, "I have an animal that I love and adore" isn't really unusual and should work, right, IllFlower?
[04-Jan-2014 22:47:10]  <SpruceZeus> alicia your magical girl should ride her noble steed into battle!!!!!
[04-Jan-2014 22:47:12]  <IllFlower> yeah.
[04-Jan-2014 22:47:15]  <Alicia> I adore and helps me through tough times*
[04-Jan-2014 22:47:24]  <Saladofstones> its a horse
[04-Jan-2014 22:47:27]  <Alicia> But it's a bearded dragon Sprucey.

[04-Jan-2014 22:49:19]  <Alicia> Lol, IllFlower.
[04-Jan-2014 22:49:24]  <SpruceZeus> ponicalica: oh yeah i saw a tumblr post about that
[04-Jan-2014 22:49:24]  <Alicia> You are correct.
[04-Jan-2014 22:49:47]  <Alicia> Also sorry for deleting your bullet the first time, I though I accidentally left it there or something.
[04-Jan-2014 22:49:56]  <Barcodrawing> SpruceZeus: fresh witch of bel-air
[04-Jan-2014 22:50:10]  <Barcodrawing> well, fresh wizard. smith fightin' the dragon
[04-Jan-2014 22:50:34]  <Alicia> Also how old are Hikari and Hibiki.
[04-Jan-2014 22:50:56]  <Alicia> Especially compared to the rest.
[04-Jan-2014 22:51:03]  <SpruceZeus> Barcodrawing: a couple of witches who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood
[04-Jan-2014 22:51:04]  <Alicia> Like does it matter tooo much or what.
[04-Jan-2014 22:51:27]  <ponicalica> Well, it was part of the dynamics, where Ayako had a lot less experience than Jun or Hitomi
[04-Jan-2014 22:51:40]  <IllFlower> Alicia: make it up. the general idea is that most initiates are "typical magical girl age," and that Conservators are slightly older.
[04-Jan-2014 22:52:04]  <IllFlower> virtually nobody sticks it out past 25. who knows what happens to them.
[04-Jan-2014 22:52:19]  <Alicia> Uuuuh 17/18.
[04-Jan-2014 22:52:26]  <Alicia> 17.
[04-Jan-2014 22:52:26]  <Alicia> ?
[04-Jan-2014 22:52:41]  <Saladofstones> 18
[04-Jan-2014 22:53:03]  <Saladofstones> why not both?
[04-Jan-2014 22:53:15]  <Barcodrawing> lol.
[04-Jan-2014 22:53:23]  <Alicia> Lol.
[04-Jan-2014 22:53:37]  <Alicia> Eeh I'll put age down later when we get to those other characteristics.
[04-Jan-2014 22:53:42]  <Alicia> Also how's that look IllFlower?
[04-Jan-2014 22:53:44]  <Saladofstones> I think we're onto belongings
[04-Jan-2014 22:53:52]  <IllFlower> just a sec.
[04-Jan-2014 22:54:13]  <IllFlower> you're not actually going with the bearded dragon thing, are you `_`
[04-Jan-2014 22:54:29]  <Alicia> Why not, is that bad.
[04-Jan-2014 22:54:43]  <Alicia> I also didn't want to think up a random human name.
[04-Jan-2014 22:54:54]  <Barcodrawing> IF can do that for you.
[04-Jan-2014 22:55:14]  <SpruceZeus> ponicalica: aw, no mention of 'i'll bash ye fookin 'ead in i sware on me mum?'
[04-Jan-2014 22:55:20]  <Alicia> I'll change it though, yeah, if needed.
[04-Jan-2014 22:55:37]  <Rig> Also, yeah, I'm not sure how a bearded dragon is something you fight for.
[04-Jan-2014 22:55:44]  <SpruceZeus> im pretty sure that version of it was around before any of the 'wow very x such y' stuff
[04-Jan-2014 22:55:47]  <Rig> "My bearded dragon motivated me to become a magical girl!"
[04-Jan-2014 22:56:08]  <Barcodrawing> yeah you guys don't seem big on having character motivations.
[04-Jan-2014 22:56:09]  <Saladofstones> Give the bearded dragon a human name
[04-Jan-2014 22:56:14]  <SpruceZeus> i became a magical girl for my ant farm!
[04-Jan-2014 22:56:14]  <Barcodrawing> it's just like. hey. here they are.
[04-Jan-2014 22:56:37]  <Barcodrawing> i mean i started with "I want kardal spindal as a magawker" and then i went "okay how about some pouty girl okay why is she pouty" and then
[04-Jan-2014 22:56:40]  <Alicia> Hmmmm.
[04-Jan-2014 22:56:57]  <Rig> Yeah, I'd have to agree. I mean, Hibiki at least has some kind of vague psychopath thing going on, but that describes every DnD character ever.
[04-Jan-2014 22:57:14]  <Rig> And I really dunno what Hikari is a conservator for other than she thinks they're really neat.
[04-Jan-2014 22:57:33]  <SpruceZeus> bonus to breaking pottery and boxes, double if it belongs to someone else
[04-Jan-2014 22:57:38]  <Barcodrawing> then i came up with the whole "she saved her town but the way she d ealt with the stress pushed everyone away from her, then medoking was all she had, so she was like wahtever, okay, i guess ith elps people, i better do it" and then she just fought and wasn't afraid to rough people up because she doesn't get close enough to people to care."
[04-Jan-2014 22:57:44]  <Barcodrawing> thing.
[04-Jan-2014 22:58:18]  <Barcodrawing> like this doesn't mean your characters shouldn't be dedicated to conservating, but what is it about them, as people, that makes them want that?
[04-Jan-2014 22:58:26]  <Saladofstones> oh
[04-Jan-2014 22:58:33]  <Saladofstones> I was more fucsed on post-becoming conservating
[04-Jan-2014 22:58:37]  <Alicia> Hm. A now-distant friend that hehlped influence her early on pushed (inadvertently) into this sort of overly-idealistic state, but trying to change that would be like going back on the past?
[04-Jan-2014 22:58:42]  <Rig> Well, they're still people.
[04-Jan-2014 22:58:42]  <Alicia> helped*
[04-Jan-2014 22:58:50]  <Barcodrawing> it's a role-playing game, after all. you're playing roles. the world is something you all work on, but first and foremost you're playing people.
[04-Jan-2014 22:58:54]  <Alicia> I was going to say teacher but that's been used.
[04-Jan-2014 22:58:55]  <Rig> They need some kind of motivation or goal beyond "I'm conservating"
[04-Jan-2014 22:59:13]  <IllFlower> I think it's fine if the characters start out a bit generic, but if it's impossible to understand their motivations and means there's no way you're going to be able to roleplay them coherently.
[04-Jan-2014 22:59:15]  <Barcodrawing> and well yeah, taht's also potentially important, what do they want /outside/ of conservating.
[04-Jan-2014 22:59:51]  <Rig> And like I said, Hibiki has the regaining honor thing, but I don't really get much of that in her traits. Or why she'd want that based on her traits.
[04-Jan-2014 22:59:52]  <Alicia> Right.
[04-Jan-2014 23:00:10]  <Saladofstones> let me rework this
[04-Jan-2014 23:00:27]  <Barcodrawing> it doesn't really mean "cahngew hat you have", more "okay, this is what you have, now attach a person to it"
[04-Jan-2014 23:00:59]  <Saladofstones> hmm, I didn't think about how Hibiki ended up
[04-Jan-2014 23:01:26]  <Rig> Hikari could be cool if you attached some kind of twisted morality to her or something. Like, why is she so hung up on things being righteous?
[04-Jan-2014 23:01:46]  <Rig> How can she grow from this obsession with righteousness?
[04-Jan-2014 23:02:07]  <Alicia> Mhm…
[04-Jan-2014 23:02:28]  <Alicia> No, yeah, I mean I get what y'all are saying I'm just trying to find the words, sorry.
[04-Jan-2014 23:02:58]  <Saladofstones> Before she became a meguca, Hibiki resigned herself to a life that was going to be pointless. She didn't enjoy the extremely conformist society she lived in, she looked up to the ideal that her father represented (standing up for what he belived in), but he gave that up so he could have a stable family life
[04-Jan-2014 23:04:25]  <Rig> One of the things we did when we created characters for the first group was after we laid out stats and traits IllFlower wrote a little blurb about each character as he saw them based on what had been done so far.
[04-Jan-2014 23:04:49]  <Rig> And that helped us see how our characters were seen and told us if we wanted to go on with that perspective.
[04-Jan-2014 23:05:32]  <ponicalica> Yeah.  That was really helpful.
[04-Jan-2014 23:05:48]  <IllFlower> oh, wonderful, I oughta do that again.
[04-Jan-2014 23:05:52]  <Alicia> Until becoming a megudoker, Hikari had ways of affecting the world but not really changing it in any *overt* ways. So, after enough time she got to thinking what's the point? I could see her looking up to a friend (name unknown) who she saw as actually being able to change things like she wanted (and was naturally a great influence). So to back away from any of this power would be an affront to her memory of her friend, and the goals she's
[04-Jan-2014 23:05:58]  <Saladofstones> I figure a big thing is that Hibiki saw being a meguca as a way to accomplish everything she wanted in life and over time being a meguca wa her full time
[04-Jan-2014 23:06:05]  <Rig> IllFlower is stunned to learn that he helped by being a busybody.
[04-Jan-2014 23:06:21]  <IllFlower> Rig: right arrow through the heart, that.
[04-Jan-2014 23:06:47]  <Saladofstones> she got in because of her best friend, but over time cut off ties with her previous life, and dedicated herself to the cause. The thing with her dad is important since he's everythings he wants to be and doesn't want to
[04-Jan-2014 23:07:02]  <Saladofstones> she liked the idea that he resisted society as it was but disliked that because of familial ties, he gave up
[04-Jan-2014 23:07:12]  <IllFlower> okay, hold on a second, I can't read too many blocks of text at once.
[04-Jan-2014 23:07:44]  <Alicia> And the aforementioned friend wasn't just, like, a great influence morally but overall. Enjoying life more, meeting new people, maybe like actually coming out of her shell from "the world must improoove" but then she's a madoker.
[04-Jan-2014 23:07:48]  <Alicia> Ah, okay.
[04-Jan-2014 23:08:29]  *** Barcodrawing is now known as Barcode
[04-Jan-2014 23:08:36]  <Alicia> Sort of darting back and forth, but the ideal and her memories of her friend are the only consistent things, so they're like a lifeline in a way.
[04-Jan-2014 23:10:58]  <Alicia> I think one weakness I could put down is insecurity with how she is and how she wants to be in general, but I'm not sure how I'd fit that in.
[04-Jan-2014 23:11:09]  <Alicia> Whole lotta projecting onto the role of the conservator.
[04-Jan-2014 23:12:20]  <Barcode> Alicia: previous message cut off: " So to back away from any of this power would be an affront to her memory of her friend, and the goals she's"
[04-Jan-2014 23:12:30]  <Alicia> Whoops my bad.
[04-Jan-2014 23:12:32]  <Alicia> Sec.
[04-Jan-2014 23:12:51]  <Alicia> "she's been  harboring/that have been reawakened.
[04-Jan-2014 23:12:52]  <Alicia> "
[04-Jan-2014 23:13:15]  <Alicia> Related to the back-and-forth thing.
[04-Jan-2014 23:13:43]  <Alicia> Once that friend moved away, there's no one else *as* close to her which… sort of just led to stagnation, in a way.
[04-Jan-2014 23:14:08]  <Alicia> I'm bad with words.
[04-Jan-2014 23:15:56]  <IllFlower> Alicia: so I summarized what I'm getting from your character's stats and traits in the sheet.

[04-Jan-2014 23:16:06]  <Alicia> Sounds spot on really.
[04-Jan-2014 23:16:12]  <Barcode> much better, lady and gentleman.
[04-Jan-2014 23:16:13]  <IllFlower> working on one for Saladofstones...
[04-Jan-2014 23:16:46]  <Barcode> see, having a backstory *also* helps with the Relationship dice.
[04-Jan-2014 23:16:57]  <Barcode> er, a backstory that actually demonstrates what kind of people the characters are*
[04-Jan-2014 23:17:05]  <Saladofstones> oh I haven't finished mine, unless you mean what I put in relationship
[04-Jan-2014 23:17:22]  <Barcode> well, i mean, your character's dad seems to be your big one.
[04-Jan-2014 23:17:31]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: I'm getting the impression that the story you've got clashes with your choice of background. being betrayed really would be more of a Complicated Community thing
[04-Jan-2014 23:17:54]  <IllFlower> her problems were pushed onto her by external circumstances, instead of stemming from her own weaknesses.
[04-Jan-2014 23:18:21]  *** Section42L <~Section@CPE18593345ef4c-CM18593345ef49.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[04-Jan-2014 23:19:00]  <Alicia> I get that Barcode, I just had trouble with coming up how to define it. I think next time I ever do one of these with y'all I'll come up with some sort of abstract background and work different ways from there, for times like this.
[04-Jan-2014 23:19:08]  <IllFlower> and the fact that she's a good sleuth doesn't really gel with getting thrown under the bus... I'd think she'd have figured out what happened and proved it to everyone else.
[04-Jan-2014 23:20:00]  <IllFlower> it's a nice plot for a "disowned detective clears name" story, but as a backstory it seems contradictory.
[04-Jan-2014 23:21:29]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: the situation is that the truth is irrelevent, someone had to take the fall and she put herself in the position that it fell upon her
[04-Jan-2014 23:21:49]  <Saladofstones> people knew that she wasn't guilty, but it allowed them to fix the issue and she saw that it was a losing battle
[04-Jan-2014 23:22:17]  <Saladofstones> as far as character, I didn't get into it properly but I feel that while she is good at her -job- she isn't really good at anything else. Least of all being a good human being
[04-Jan-2014 23:22:18]  <IllFlower> that doesn't really come out in her traits, though.
[04-Jan-2014 23:22:42]  <IllFlower> and that just raises another question of why she would take the fall when the rest of her character suggests that she really wouldn't appreciate doing that.
[04-Jan-2014 23:22:52]  <Barcode> Alicia: oh, you don't have to be abstract or what not. Just like. Think about how people are, think of how you'd want a character like this to be as a person, and connect that to the stat shit you've picked already.
[04-Jan-2014 23:23:17]  <Saladofstones> She didn't want to, but again, it was a losing battle. It was the lesser of two evils for her
[04-Jan-2014 23:23:35]  <Saladofstones> since one involved taking the hit and being reinstated and working up again, the other involves being kicked out with no chance of being reinstated
[04-Jan-2014 23:23:42]  <Alicia> Mm. I'm really bad at untangling thoughts on the spot, is all. x_x Hence me saying stuff like write stuff down in the abstract first.
[04-Jan-2014 23:23:55]  <Saladofstones> yeah I'm having a lot of issues at the moment untangling
[04-Jan-2014 23:23:56]  <Alicia> untangling/connecting things even if I have som idea*

[04-Jan-2014 23:25:24]  <Barcode> SpruceZeus: by some accounts this is approximately the same "creepy mask to bishonen" effect i am capable of
[04-Jan-2014 23:25:34]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: I get that, there's a kind of "plead guilty and get a bargain" pragmatism to it. but the tension between "stand up for what you believe in" and that pragmatism isn't really addressed, at all.
[04-Jan-2014 23:25:56]  <Saladofstones> true, I'm not sure how to frame what her beliefs are
[04-Jan-2014 23:26:16]  <Barcode> SpruceZeus: http://witnessthesurreal.tumblr.com/post/72251368270/squeedge-squeedgeart-hail-gay-satan-by "my enormous horse"

[04-Jan-2014 23:26:17]  <Saladofstones> its basically a strong idea of pragmatic individualism that she feels she's being denied in society and that meguca society allowed
[04-Jan-2014 23:26:54]  <Saladofstones> so I think that whatever she may have believed for the group was secondary to her losing everything, and she is after herself in the end
[04-Jan-2014 23:27:09]  <Saladofstones> It might be a conflict for her, since she basically did the same thing her dad did, which she hated
[04-Jan-2014 23:27:47]  <IllFlower> hm, okay.
[04-Jan-2014 23:27:56]  <Saladofstones> I have no idea how to explain all that
[04-Jan-2014 23:27:58]  <Alicia> re "I'm not sure how to frame what her beliefs are": I know Hikari deals in abstracts, a fair bit out of impulsiveness and closeneess.
[04-Jan-2014 23:28:08]  <Alicia> Like, that's What You Know.
[04-Jan-2014 23:28:34]  <Alicia> Not exactly a… solid get stuff done person like Hitomi.
[04-Jan-2014 23:29:27]  <Alicia> realistic*
[04-Jan-2014 23:29:45]  <Alicia> As far as I remember Hitomi did everything she meant to do, exceeeept for when she didn't.
[04-Jan-2014 23:29:54]  <Barcode> Alicia: Is your character like, nice to people?
[04-Jan-2014 23:29:55]  <Saladofstones> although you're right in that it doesn't fit complicated history
[04-Jan-2014 23:30:06]  <Alicia> Well, yes, Barcode.
[04-Jan-2014 23:30:12]  <Saladofstones> since granted she doesn't seem like the best human being, but she didn't really do anything to herself
[04-Jan-2014 23:30:18]  <Saladofstones> but I'm not sure if complicated community fits
[04-Jan-2014 23:30:26]  <Barcode> Impulsiveness can also involve "okay let's be friends, oh you're doing this bad stuff the ORDER doesn't want, well hey c'mon come off of it" and trying to work in that way instead of Hitomi's "let's not be friends, quit bugging the ORDER or i'll black your eyes"
[04-Jan-2014 23:31:07]  <Alicia> Right, I was forgetting Hitomi was quick to the punches, huh.
[04-Jan-2014 23:31:59]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: well, it seems like the majority of what defines Hibiki's character now were those external circumstances, which is basically what Complicated Community is for.
[04-Jan-2014 23:32:15]  <Alicia> Also Hikari doesn't imagine harmfulness as being the way to helping. Just like you could manipulate but not be an ass (see: characters not Izaya in DRRRRR!!). Another character I had in mind was like that, but I later dropped her idea.
[04-Jan-2014 23:32:30]  <IllFlower> the manual says "socially vulnerable," or from "broken, in-crisis, or destructive" surroundings.
[04-Jan-2014 23:32:47]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[04-Jan-2014 23:32:53]  <Saladofstones> I guess that in-cisis works

[04-Jan-2014 23:33:47]  <Rig> Just slightly distracted by dinner.
[04-Jan-2014 23:34:08]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: even then, what with her disappointment in her father, those are external circumstances too.
[04-Jan-2014 23:34:22]  <SpruceZeus> Fiora: Alicia mentioned DRRR and i guess i associate that anime with you because of a silly joke!
[04-Jan-2014 23:34:27]  <Barcode> Well, okay, if you would switch to Comlicated Community, what changes?
[04-Jan-2014 23:34:27]  <IllFlower> other people let her down. even if she's got a lot of her own problems they didn't really get her where she is today.
[04-Jan-2014 23:34:45]  <Barcode> it is, after all, a label to be placed upon the backstory, right.
[04-Jan-2014 23:34:46]  <IllFlower> trait and relationship dice change, stats stay the same.
[04-Jan-2014 23:35:24]  <IllFlower> traits 4d4 2d6 2d10 -> 6d6 2d8; relationships 5d6 2d8 -> 4d4 2d6 2d8 2d10

[04-Jan-2014 23:44:26]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: if you want to keep the sleuthing trait, you could have the backstory be that she's good at getting to the bottom of things, but in her specific situation w/r/t betrayal it did her zero good because everyone knew and yet was still willing to throw her under the bus.
[04-Jan-2014 23:47:03]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: sounds good
[04-Jan-2014 23:47:30]  <Barcode> situations where your strengths don't help are always interesting.
[04-Jan-2014 23:47:34]  <Rig> You could also split the 2d8 into two 1d8 traits. One for history knowledge and another for something like understanding how propaganda works and using that to her advantage.
[04-Jan-2014 23:48:57]  <Saladofstones> Rig: sort of like a combination of knowing people and how organizations work?

[04-Jan-2014 23:50:37]  <Saladofstones> sounds good
[04-Jan-2014 23:50:58]  <Barcode> it seems fairly widely-applicable without being something you could just jam into any conflict.
[04-Jan-2014 23:51:02]  <Barcode> so, a good trait.

[04-Jan-2014 23:54:55]  <Barcode> but i could have had a perfect character and then still have been worried.
[04-Jan-2014 23:55:06]  <Barcode> "is this character...TOO GOOD for our RP???"
[04-Jan-2014 23:55:17]  <Alicia> ?????!
[05-Jan-2014 00:01:35]  <Saladofstones> As far as Hibiki, she's not a social darwinist but she has a view that there will be the haves and have-nots
[05-Jan-2014 00:01:55]  <Saladofstones> and the have-nots aren't really weaker people, but conditioned and complacent so she is very dedicate to being opposite of this
[05-Jan-2014 00:02:10]  <ponicalica> the strong and the weak
[05-Jan-2014 00:02:21]  <ponicalica> inb4 kaito kumon
[05-Jan-2014 00:02:28]  <Saladofstones> whenever I hear that I think of sterotypical anime darwinists
[05-Jan-2014 00:03:13]  <Saladofstones> She's must more personal about this and is more afraid about people stepping over her shit than she is about subjugating anyone else
[05-Jan-2014 00:03:19]  <SpruceZeus> kawaii darwin
[05-Jan-2014 00:03:24]  <SpruceZeus> omg
[05-Jan-2014 00:03:35]  <ponicalica> SpruceZeus: eh, more like kawaii...galton?  fuck, I forgot dude's name
[05-Jan-2014 00:03:37]  <ponicalica> darwin's cousin
[05-Jan-2014 00:04:23]  <SpruceZeus> ponicalica: well no, i know that we are talking about /darwinists/ here, not darwin himself, but salad saying that just made me imagine kawaii charles darwin

[05-Jan-2014 00:15:48]  <IllFlower> okay, I'm back. got wine for my trouble. sorry for the delay...
[05-Jan-2014 00:16:10]  <Saladofstones> drowning your tears?
[05-Jan-2014 00:17:28]  <IllFlower> my tears are wine. trufax.
[05-Jan-2014 00:18:09]  <ponicalica> JesusFlower
[05-Jan-2014 00:18:36]  <Alicia> Jesus, Illflower.
[05-Jan-2014 00:18:40]  <IllFlower> okay, I'm not sure how much progress has been made since I left, so uh...
[05-Jan-2014 00:20:49]  <IllFlower> it doesn't look like all that much has changed on the sheets.
[05-Jan-2014 00:21:05]  <Rig> Saladofstones split his 2d8 sleuthing into two traits.
[05-Jan-2014 00:21:32]  <IllFlower> okay. I'm still a bit confused as to how the traits are supposed to come together.
[05-Jan-2014 00:22:37]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@181.135.182.42> has joined #madokamadness
[05-Jan-2014 00:22:38]  <IllFlower> just from a surface reading it sounds like she's a Soviet history professor who knows all the tricks she needs to secure tenure.
[05-Jan-2014 00:22:48]  <IllFlower> and magic.
[05-Jan-2014 00:23:17]  <Alicia> Lol.
[05-Jan-2014 00:23:59]  <ponicalica> contract for tenure
[05-Jan-2014 00:24:19]  <Barcode> lol.
[05-Jan-2014 00:25:08]  <IllFlower> "I wish those sexist old men would die in a fire so I can finally get my full professorship!" /
[05-Jan-2014 00:25:09]  <Saladofstones> seems like a good use of magic
[05-Jan-2014 00:25:30]  * Alicia nods.
[05-Jan-2014 00:26:17]  <Saladofstones> I mean reaching tenure is liken to never, ever losing that position
[05-Jan-2014 00:26:22]  <Saladofstones> get to chill and talk about communbism all day
[05-Jan-2014 00:27:30]  <Barcode> tenure's apparently not a very permanent thing any more.
[05-Jan-2014 00:27:33]  <IllFlower> in all seriousness, though, I'm not really sure what the character is getting at.
[05-Jan-2014 00:29:24]  <IllFlower> especially given the backstory provided earlier, which is kinda compelling but doesn't come out in the traits at all.
[05-Jan-2014 00:30:27]  <Saladofstones> imma
[05-Jan-2014 00:30:29]  <Saladofstones> eat some food first
[05-Jan-2014 00:31:02]  <IllFlower> (+Rig) I think it might not be a bad idea to wrap up, actually. it looks like we're pretty much out of steam for this session even if we're not finished.
[05-Jan-2014 00:31:15]  <Rig> Yeah, maybe.
[05-Jan-2014 00:31:16]  <Saladofstones> I vote for this
[05-Jan-2014 00:31:32]  <IllFlower> okay. how free are you guys, say, tomorrow?
[05-Jan-2014 00:31:35]  <Saladofstones> This took much longer than I thought and now I honestly don't know where to take my character yet
[05-Jan-2014 00:31:55]  <Rig> I'm free tomorrow all day.
[05-Jan-2014 00:32:07]  <Alicia> I should be free all day tomorrow.
[05-Jan-2014 00:32:19]  <Saladofstones> yeah I'm free tomorrow as well
[05-Jan-2014 00:33:11]  <IllFlower> okay, does anyone object to doing this at the same time tomorrow?
[05-Jan-2014 00:33:21]  <IllFlower> if we're refreshed enough we may even be able to get through initiations.
[05-Jan-2014 00:33:35]  <IllFlower> (which took a whole other session last time so we're not *that* far behind)
[05-Jan-2014 00:33:35]  <Barcode> i'm not actually in this, so i vote yes
[05-Jan-2014 00:33:57]  <Rig> I'm good with that.
[05-Jan-2014 00:34:05]  <Rig> Getting initiations done at the same time would be good.
[05-Jan-2014 00:35:16]  <Saladofstones> Sounds good
[05-Jan-2014 00:35:26]  <Saladofstones> It shouldn't take too long, I can figure out where to go from here
[05-Jan-2014 00:35:32]  <Saladofstones> god damn you barcode and your split the sleuth suggestion
[05-Jan-2014 00:35:45]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | All times U.S. ET/PT | MAGICAL DOGS continues Sun 3p/noon | Xeniera is planning FF:Eva
[05-Jan-2014 00:35:46]  <Saladofstones> although someone who is basically a magical scholar might be cool
[05-Jan-2014 00:35:53]  <IllFlower> okay, done. thanks for putting up with the long session, guys.
