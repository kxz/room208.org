@time=2014-01-04T20:17:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :to map to Dogs' levels of conflict: verbal conflict = Acuity + Heart. physical = Body + Heart. hand-to-hand combat = Body + Will. magical = Acuity + Will.
@time=2014-01-04T20:18:14.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks.
@time=2014-01-04T20:18:20.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but given that penal megucas are likely not the most uptight of citizens, I'd imagine that her body is rather high
@time=2014-01-04T20:18:26.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :in terms of stats
@time=2014-01-04T20:18:37.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno how I feel about the whole prisoner thing.
@time=2014-01-04T20:19:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :don't forget that the number of stat dice you have depends on your background.
@time=2014-01-04T20:19:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It seems kind of weird for a group that literally just fought a meduka that went bad for them to just get assigned a new one.
@time=2014-01-04T20:19:12.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mean, I guess it'd create tension.
@time=2014-01-04T20:19:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Jun definitely wouldn't like her.
@time=2014-01-04T20:19:29.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I'm with Rig, I feel like that idea kind of clashes with the purpose of Conservators :V
@time=2014-01-04T20:19:32.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm just going to say ??? for now because I'm still thinking on a name. Or, well, deciding.
@time=2014-01-04T20:19:35.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I guess IllFlower should weigh in, since it's his universe.
@time=2014-01-04T20:19:36.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Something that could map to our first session /is/ the idea of penalization, though that would also depend on you guys deciding how exactly penalization works.
@time=2014-01-04T20:19:55.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also, the Conservators are granted their status because they're good at what they do. Regular dokers are still regular dokers.
@time=2014-01-04T20:20:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :gimme a second, I'm still doing some setup.
@time=2014-01-04T20:20:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay.
@time=2014-01-04T20:20:08.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The idea is that my character wasn't lol genocide, but someone who used her powers in ways that opposte the status quo
@time=2014-01-04T20:20:32.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :perhaps someone involved in a civil war, or someone who was inducted into the wrong crowd but otherwise shown dedication aligned with the conservators/fixers
@time=2014-01-04T20:20:51.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I mean. That works, though it's not something that would get you Conservator status. Of course, the rules also say you can have someone who just gets associated with the fixers for whatever reason
@time=2014-01-04T20:20:53.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd imagine it would not be anyone who opposed them fundamentally or unstable/unreliable prisoners

@time=2014-01-04T20:21:25.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Got it.
@time=2014-01-04T20:21:29.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Illflower: if its okay, I want to know if my character basis is accepted before I start putting in stats
@time=2014-01-04T20:21:33.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :17 stats? Right…
@time=2014-01-04T20:21:35.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :since that might change where I take the character

@time=2014-01-04T20:22:20.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: I'd imagine there'd be conflict, since I imagine your character like JUSTICE from akame ga kiru
@time=2014-01-04T20:22:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno what that is at all.
@time=2014-01-04T20:22:40.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but I have to look through the logs to see what happened with the last meguca
@time=2014-01-04T20:23:16.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: one of the characters, convinced that she is correct, willing to do anything to uphold her friends and ideals, doesn't get along with anyone who doesn't conform to her ideas, rather black and white in her thinking
@time=2014-01-04T20:23:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well, the story is such that Shii (this group's familiar) is in trouble with the higher-ups.
@time=2014-01-04T20:23:21.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :0,0 half the woman she used to be
@time=2014-01-04T20:23:25.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ack this chat is fast.
@time=2014-01-04T20:23:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :after the general failure of the last mission.
@time=2014-01-04T20:23:39.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hmm
@time=2014-01-04T20:23:48.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :it could be that is why someone who is a 'penal meguca' is assigned?
@time=2014-01-04T20:23:52.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :or part of why
@time=2014-01-04T20:24:06.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd imagine if he is in trouble with the higher-ups, he doesn't get the best selection, right?
@time=2014-01-04T20:24:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so depending on how punitive they are, they might reassign her one of the Conservators' more insubordinate members, but it'd have to be someone that would be able to *be* a Conservator in the first place.
@time=2014-01-04T20:24:41.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well she'd be someone who'd want to be a conservator, at least now, and with skills relevant to what the familiar needs
@time=2014-01-04T20:25:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :and the hierarchy isn't motivated by spite; rarely does spite manage to make it out of committee.
@time=2014-01-04T20:25:16.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd imagine something more than an explosive collar is needed at this stage, it could be someone who was a penal meguca for awhile now (relatively) and recently got promoted to be a conservator
@time=2014-01-04T20:25:31.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so her crime wouldn't have to be too heinous at this point, or at least its overlooked
@time=2014-01-04T20:26:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :there'd still need to be good reason for that promotion. the inertia of a bad reputation is quite strong.
@time=2014-01-04T20:26:17.000Z :SpruceZeus|away NICK SpruceZeus
@time=2014-01-04T20:26:21.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well what is the turnover rate for conservators?
@time=2014-01-04T20:26:26.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :???: Body is 4d6, Acuity is 3d6, Heart is 4d6, Will is 2d6.
@time=2014-01-04T20:26:29.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I believe.
@time=2014-01-04T20:26:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :not high. the hierarchy has its troubles but it's not obviously dysfunctional.
@time=2014-01-04T20:27:09.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Like most any *good* organization?
@time=2014-01-04T20:27:16.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or well-designed, whatever.
@time=2014-01-04T20:27:27.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hmm, but I'd imagine that conservators are stretched on resources, right?
@time=2014-01-04T20:27:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :not necessarily.
@time=2014-01-04T20:27:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno. They had a library and shit.
@time=2014-01-04T20:27:55.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :a library with a donjon, even.
@time=2014-01-04T20:28:02.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :even with the inertia of a bad reputation, for someone to be a penal megjuca and get anywhere in the organization would require some basis that they can be trusted
@time=2014-01-04T20:28:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :they had enough to send three Conservators after a kid with a book, so they're not exactly short-handed.
@time=2014-01-04T20:28:31.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :granted, it might be like escape from new york with SNAAAKE, but the powers that be view them as not a threat at the least
@time=2014-01-04T20:28:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How would newer entries be treated?
@time=2014-01-04T20:28:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I really don't understand the concept I guess. Like they're being punished by being trusted?
@time=2014-01-04T20:28:55.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Like mine.
@time=2014-01-04T20:28:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :right, but you'd have to make a strong case for why that character *can* be trusted.
@time=2014-01-04T20:29:10.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or, well, new to the group and such, that deal.
@time=2014-01-04T20:29:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: newer entries? like fresh inductees, you mean?
@time=2014-01-04T20:29:16.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes.
@time=2014-01-04T20:29:24.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Pretty much.
@time=2014-01-04T20:29:38.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: They aren't being punished, the idea being that they are prisoners who can be trusted, generalyl those with background in-line with being a conservator
@time=2014-01-04T20:29:49.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't imagine every penal meguca is a lol evil kinda person
@time=2014-01-04T20:30:04.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So would you be punished by us basically watching over you or what.
@time=2014-01-04T20:30:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: I dunno, it really depends on how Rig and ponicalica play it.
@time=2014-01-04T20:30:10.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Saladofstones: The big thing is that fixers are basically like cops, or cop investigators. You don't give prisoners police jurisdiction.
@time=2014-01-04T20:30:10.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noted.
@time=2014-01-04T20:30:21.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Like, anywhere.
@time=2014-01-04T20:30:29.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Barcodrawing: I got the feeling that it was sort of like the wild west, so you had laxer standards
@time=2014-01-04T20:30:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :it's not, it's the Mormon West. those have rather higher standards :p
@time=2014-01-04T20:31:00.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And more wives.
@time=2014-01-04T20:31:08.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe I converted into mormonism
@time=2014-01-04T20:31:08.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There's also what IF said, re "they sent three people after one kid".
@time=2014-01-04T20:31:09.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes, important details.
@time=2014-01-04T20:31:20.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"plus their dog"
@time=2014-01-04T20:31:36.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :or i guess, they sent a dog and its three people under one kid.
@time=2014-01-04T20:31:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: I would note that ponicalica has the "book smart but somewhat naive" corner.
@time=2014-01-04T20:31:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just checking, but I'm 13d6 because I came from a generally good area right.
@time=2014-01-04T20:31:54.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :after one kid*
@time=2014-01-04T20:31:55.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :you oughta be willing to rethink the prisoner thing, illflower isn't one for eplosive collars
@time=2014-01-04T20:32:12.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also you're kind of not supposed to go in with an idea :V
@time=2014-01-04T20:32:16.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I remember, IllFlower. Trying to think about what I want…
@time=2014-01-04T20:32:26.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :if its a problem I can switch gears
@time=2014-01-04T20:32:33.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Saladofstones: like, when it comes to the actual characterization, what would you like to do? Straddle the boundary of allowed and not allowed? You can eeeasily play a character that does questionable stuff to get conservator stuff done, I mean, I sort of went in trying to do so.
@time=2014-01-04T20:32:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: I think there's room for an "ambitious new recruit" character even there, though.
@time=2014-01-04T20:32:46.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but I feel wrt to prisoners, it has to be someone that can be trusted without a gun to their head
@time=2014-01-04T20:32:46.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :then i kinda wussed out from being more than just physical.
@time=2014-01-04T20:33:02.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Those are actually the words I was looking for, IllFlower. :v
@time=2014-01-04T20:33:17.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but you could easily cover a more illicit "gets stuff done questionably" angle, without necessarily making a cop prisoner or what not.
@time=2014-01-04T20:33:24.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Gosh, sorry. I'm kind of stressed today. Trying to dive into this to take my mind off things, etc.
@time=2014-01-04T20:33:37.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(I mean I'm still doing this I'm just slower than usual.)
@time=2014-01-04T20:33:51.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Illflower: as for why, the basis of the idea is that its someone that is willing to follow their orders blindly at this stage either out of reformed dedication or other reasons
@time=2014-01-04T20:34:15.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: yeah, "eager recruit" is good enough, you'd just probably want to make it more "determination" than "good magician", as Ponny already is doing.
@time=2014-01-04T20:34:15.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :at any rate, whatever crimes they did didn't outweigh their reliability and what caused them to be penal can be valuable to whatever needs to be done

@time=2014-01-04T20:34:46.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: It'll work, for sure.
@time=2014-01-04T20:34:47.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: You're prime urobutcheree material
@time=2014-01-04T20:34:53.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Saladofstones: If you really want to do something related to being punished - you could always play a conservator that's returning to active duty after being penalized for something.
@time=2014-01-04T20:34:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Aw, thank you.
@time=2014-01-04T20:35:14.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :that sounds good

@time=2014-01-04T20:40:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :that'd bring into question why the character was reinstated, though.
@time=2014-01-04T20:40:20.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Point.

@time=2014-01-04T20:49:45.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Saladofstones: the other thing is, consider that your character's going to mostly make its name doing character-y stuff, not because it was a 1-winged yugoslavic angel or whatever

@time=2014-01-04T21:31:37.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also, yeah, this conservator business could be a way to catapult into truuuuuly helping people, that sort of business.

@time=2014-01-04T21:32:48.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So it's nice to have traits that you can pull in for talking or stuff.

@time=2014-01-04T22:00:39.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Like, yeah, just a high/rush from it sounds acceptable.

@time=2014-01-04T22:00:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IT CAN BE ANY HIGH, SALAD.
@time=2014-01-04T22:00:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: but if you're worried about being too similar to ponicalica and Rig in your character, I think one elemental thing is that both of their characters aren't really ones to jump at conflict
@time=2014-01-04T22:01:07.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah and I think the lack of expierence opens up a lot of developments

@time=2014-01-04T22:01:52.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Jump away, or won't jump into conflict.
@time=2014-01-04T22:02:04.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think it could work
@time=2014-01-04T22:02:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.
@time=2014-01-04T22:02:10.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but it would require a very specific backstory
@time=2014-01-04T22:02:12.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :or something
@time=2014-01-04T22:02:13.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :it's not hard! you're opportunistic, you're aggressive, someone gives you a reason to hit 'em you hit 'em.

@time=2014-01-04T22:02:25.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :it won't really throw off the game if you're worried about that.
@time=2014-01-04T22:02:31.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Barcodrawing:I think the problem is more intrisic than just being opportunistic
@time=2014-01-04T22:02:48.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Everyone can be helped and everyone will be helped, god damn it.
@time=2014-01-04T22:02:49.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think there might be a thing of not wanting to get -hurt- or something, or not liking something that goes against a black-white view
@time=2014-01-04T22:03:00.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :i.e. a criminal who has reasons to be a criminal
@time=2014-01-04T22:03:07.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :or has a kid or something
@time=2014-01-04T22:03:14.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :basically cognitive dissonance is what I'm seeing
@time=2014-01-04T22:03:19.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The other thing is that basically the amount of Hits you take in-game is basically your character deciding how much they care about a conflict versus how much energy they've got in reserve.
@time=2014-01-04T22:03:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I feel like Hikari might be even more golden-child-ish than Ayako is
@time=2014-01-04T22:03:39.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so like "is afraid of conflict", unless you think it woudl directly interfere with you fighting in a conflict, is something you RP rather than have a sa stat.
@time=2014-01-04T22:03:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: or since Hikari's already "manipulative", if you want to keep the reluctance to conflict you could have her prefer to play other people so that conflict is rarely necessary
@time=2014-01-04T22:03:58.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :No, yeah, I was thinking that Hikari mostly has a bunch of built up inner tension and this is *the* way to finally actually change people's lives for the better.
@time=2014-01-04T22:04:06.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Illflower: kind of like a person not liking getting their hands dirty?
@time=2014-01-04T22:04:13.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Wait, so change 2d6 or 1d4, IllFlower.
@time=2014-01-04T22:04:16.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but ti seems like she's pretty into being in the middle of things and impulsive
@time=2014-01-04T22:04:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Saladofstones: yeah, pretty much, or at least not liking getting caught with their hands dirty
@time=2014-01-04T22:04:21.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm not sure if being manipulative works
@time=2014-01-04T22:04:26.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :i should apologize, i lost  track of things and thought you were still playing someone super go-getter-y.
@time=2014-01-04T22:04:36.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :unless it goes into that "overestimates their manipulative ability"
@time=2014-01-04T22:04:39.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :do not underestimate the power of the getter
@time=2014-01-04T22:04:44.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, I am more go-gettery than Jun or Ayako, Barcodrawing.

@time=2014-01-04T22:05:16.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well i mean, are you afraid of playing a character that's /particularly/ like that, or do you just not want to?

@time=2014-01-04T22:30:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: oh, oh, yeah, that's right
@time=2014-01-04T22:30:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Saladofstones: your character's background dictates that her troubles are caused more by herself than by the people around her, which is why she doesn't have any d4s for relationships.
@time=2014-01-04T22:31:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think I'm only going to allocate one thing to her status as a conservator, and one to maybe a good mentor or something. Teachers aren't unusual. But Jun or Ayako did that.

@time=2014-01-04T22:33:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Saladofstones: another way to think of it might be that her relationships stabilize her (or give her some kind of strength); her weaknesses are more her own than they come from external circumstances.
@time=2014-01-04T22:33:58.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Illflower: so as a relationship, could I reference the conservators as a whole and the penal system she went through?

@time=2014-01-04T23:00:59.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hmm, I didn't think about how Hibiki ended up
@time=2014-01-04T23:01:26.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari could be cool if you attached some kind of twisted morality to her or something. Like, why is she so hung up on things being righteous?
@time=2014-01-04T23:01:46.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How can she grow from this obsession with righteousness?
@time=2014-01-04T23:02:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mhm…
@time=2014-01-04T23:02:28.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :No, yeah, I mean I get what y'all are saying I'm just trying to find the words, sorry.
@time=2014-01-04T23:02:58.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Before she became a meguca, Hibiki resigned herself to a life that was going to be pointless. She didn't enjoy the extremely conformist society she lived in, she looked up to the ideal that her father represented (standing up for what he belived in), but he gave that up so he could have a stable family life
@time=2014-01-04T23:04:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :One of the things we did when we created characters for the first group was after we laid out stats and traits IllFlower wrote a little blurb about each character as he saw them based on what had been done so far.
@time=2014-01-04T23:04:49.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And that helped us see how our characters were seen and told us if we wanted to go on with that perspective.

@time=2014-01-04T23:05:52.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Until becoming a megudoker, Hikari had ways of affecting the world but not really changing it in any *overt* ways. So, after enough time she got to thinking what's the point? I could see her looking up to a friend (name unknown) who she saw as actually being able to change things like she wanted (and was naturally a great influence). So to back away from any of this power would be an affront to her memory of her friend, and the goals she's
@time=2014-01-04T23:05:58.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I figure a big thing is that Hibiki saw being a meguca as a way to accomplish everything she wanted in life and over time being a meguca wa her full time

@time=2014-01-04T23:06:47.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she got in because of her best friend, but over time cut off ties with her previous life, and dedicated herself to the cause. The thing with her dad is important since he's everythings he wants to be and doesn't want to
@time=2014-01-04T23:07:02.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she liked the idea that he resisted society as it was but disliked that because of familial ties, he gave up
