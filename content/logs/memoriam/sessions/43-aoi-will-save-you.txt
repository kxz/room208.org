[13-Jun-2015 19:26:32]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Find ice cold Kazuki Sakura frozen treats at your local convenience store!
[13-Jun-2015 19:27:38]  <IllFlower> Last time, the Conservators were trying to figure out how to track Naoki Miyama without attracting too much attention, and Rin was playing games on her phone.
[13-Jun-2015 19:28:52]  <IllFlower> Given Kazuki's reluctance to involve his father in this, the decision seems to have been to talk to one of Ayako's old young Prophet connections. Is that right?
[13-Jun-2015 19:29:22]  <Calica> Yeah, I think so
[13-Jun-2015 19:29:34]  <Icon> Pretty certain.
[13-Jun-2015 19:29:36]  <BGTB2005> sounds like the plan
[13-Jun-2015 19:30:10]  <Rig> Sounds good.
[13-Jun-2015 19:30:36]  <Icon> (Also, MFW there's yet to be a Hikari-based topic. :C)
[13-Jun-2015 19:30:44]  <IllFlower> We were talking to Yurika, yes?
[13-Jun-2015 19:31:43]  <IllFlower> Going to talk to her, rather.
[13-Jun-2015 19:31:49]  <Calica> Icon: so next week IllFlower will have to put something about handcuffs in the topic
[13-Jun-2015 19:31:50]  <Calica> IllFlower: yeah
[13-Jun-2015 19:32:27]  <Icon> Yes.
[13-Jun-2015 19:32:38]  <IllFlower> Then so shall it be.
[13-Jun-2015 19:33:48]  <IllFlower> Yurika agrees to meet the Conservators on the roof of a department store near the center of town. It's a bit chilly, but the temperature guarantees that nobody else in their right mind is up there.
[13-Jun-2015 19:34:03]  <Rig> Dramatic.
[13-Jun-2015 19:34:16]  <IllFlower> It's just a rooftop, man.
[13-Jun-2015 19:34:26]  <Calica> yeah but it's probably windy
[13-Jun-2015 19:34:30]  <Calica> and everyone knows wind is dramatic
[13-Jun-2015 19:34:44]  <Rig> Plus what time is it? Golden hour.
[13-Jun-2015 19:34:50]  <Rig> *?
[13-Jun-2015 19:34:57]  <IllFlower> It's, like, the middle of the afternoon.
[13-Jun-2015 19:35:11]  <IllFlower> Whatever. Power of imagination!
[13-Jun-2015 19:35:55]  <IllFlower> As the Conservators arrive, Yurika puts on her best attempt at a smile in greeting.
[13-Jun-2015 19:36:58]  <IllFlower> "Fancy seeing you again," she says.
[13-Jun-2015 19:37:15]  <Rig> When did we last see Yurika?
[13-Jun-2015 19:37:40]  <BGTB2005> I think it was before Rin set the hospital on fire
[13-Jun-2015 19:37:41]  <IllFlower> That whole Yuuya thing.
[13-Jun-2015 19:37:56]  <Rig> Right. That went well.
[13-Jun-2015 19:37:59]  <Calica> "Mmhmm.  If only it could be under better circumstances."
[13-Jun-2015 19:39:23]  <IllFlower> "Oh, no, and I was going to make a joke about that... don't tell me..."
[13-Jun-2015 19:41:47]  <IllFlower> Yurika scans Ayako's eyes for a hint at the answer.
[13-Jun-2015 19:43:11]  <Calica> (I was doing the thing where I was going to let someone else say things, but...)
[13-Jun-2015 19:43:37]  <Calica> "The two initiates who died recently...we have a suspect, but..."
[13-Jun-2015 19:43:40]  <Icon> (I was expecting Ayako to lead, because Yurika. :v)
[13-Jun-2015 19:43:46]  <IllFlower> (QUICK HIKARI JUMP IN AWKWARDLY)
[13-Jun-2015 19:44:47]  <IllFlower> "But..." Yurika echoes.

[13-Jun-2015 19:47:53]  <Calica> (okay Icon is messaging me in PM asking what happened.)
[13-Jun-2015 19:48:24]  <IllFlower> ("... wait, hold on a second, it's that weird kid from my dance class!")
[13-Jun-2015 19:48:52]  <IllFlower> You folks have got to stop using PMs all the time, we're not going to eat you if you ask things in here.
[13-Jun-2015 19:49:05]  <IllFlower> Well, I won't. Nitya might. His teeth are like fangs.
[13-Jun-2015 19:49:20]  <Icon> "But, we suspect that another Prophet is the one behind this. So far anyway, and you are currently our best lead."
[13-Jun-2015 19:49:30]  <Icon> (IF: I'm just used to messaging calico. :V)
[13-Jun-2015 19:49:35]  <Nitya> 14,14illflower's teeth are like a tensegrity sculpture
[13-Jun-2015 19:50:16]  <IllFlower> You know it.
[13-Jun-2015 19:50:40]  <IllFlower> Icon: That's fine, it's just more obvious that people are thinking when we can see it.
[13-Jun-2015 19:50:55]  <Icon> Right.
[13-Jun-2015 19:51:32]  <IllFlower> Yurika breathes a sigh of relief. "I thought you were going to tell me it was someone else close to me. Like my boyfriend or something."
[13-Jun-2015 19:52:05]  <Calica> ("Well, we can't rule that out yet...")
[13-Jun-2015 19:52:18]  <IllFlower> Naoki is, like, twice her age. Ew.

[13-Jun-2015 19:53:55]  <IllFlower> "So who's the Prophet?"
[13-Jun-2015 19:54:30]  <Calica> time to pull out the character list
[13-Jun-2015 19:54:33]  <Rig> "We'd rather keep that under wraps at the moment. We think it might be someone in charge of recruitment though."
[13-Jun-2015 19:56:41]  <IllFlower> "What makes you say that, if you don't mind my asking?"
[13-Jun-2015 19:58:10]  <Rig> "The initiates who were killed all came from one school and more recruiting at that school was happening. That doesn't make much sense."
[13-Jun-2015 19:59:24]  <Calica> "Also when we requested a familiar temporarily halt his recruitment of that school, he retired rather suddenly."
[13-Jun-2015 20:00:32]  <IllFlower> Yurika raises her eyebrows. "Right. That is pretty suspicious."
[13-Jun-2015 20:03:18]  * Rig checks logs real quick.
[13-Jun-2015 20:04:18]  <Calica> and Rin is still just in the background checking her phone or something
[13-Jun-2015 20:04:27]  <Rig> "We were hoping to flush out any corrupted persons from the initiation conclave."
[13-Jun-2015 20:04:35]  <Rig> "And that you could help us maybe?"
[13-Jun-2015 20:05:07]  <IllFlower> "You're right that the culprit is most likely on the Consilium Renascens," Yurika says, clearly forgetting to explain the random Latin phrase, "but without any particular names, it's going to be hard to do anything.
[13-Jun-2015 20:05:20]  <IllFlower> "I'm just one Prophet. I can't set a dragnet over the whole council."
[13-Jun-2015 20:08:03]  <Rig> Kazuki is still reluctant to reveal Miyama's identity, but he can see her point. How much does Ayako trust her?
[13-Jun-2015 20:08:58]  <Calica> Ayako looks at Kazuki and the other initiates.  "Your mom gave you the name, right?"
[13-Jun-2015 20:09:31]  <Rig> Not subtle at all!
[13-Jun-2015 20:09:47]  <IllFlower> We've already established that this group is pretty long for subtlety.
[13-Jun-2015 20:09:56]  <Calica> i'm bad at subtlety, sorry
[13-Jun-2015 20:09:57]  * Calica braces for fan
[13-Jun-2015 20:10:30]  <BGTB2005> 14what is 'subtlety'?
[13-Jun-2015 20:10:46]  <Rig> "We believe that Miyama might be the corrupt prophet."

[13-Jun-2015 20:13:55]  <IllFlower> Yurika seems to be turning a litany of things over in her head.
[13-Jun-2015 20:14:45]  <Rig> "What's wrong?" Kazuki asks. He already regrets spilling the name so easily.
[13-Jun-2015 20:15:23]  <IllFlower> "It's nothing. He just has a... complicated history. I imagine you already know all that, though."
[13-Jun-2015 20:15:39]  <Rig> "I do."
[13-Jun-2015 20:16:53]  <Rig> "Does this mean you can't help us?"
[13-Jun-2015 20:17:09]  <IllFlower> "The story does fit together, for what it's worth. Miyama served on the council until about a year ago. He might have resigned to give himself cover... assuming what you're saying is true."
[13-Jun-2015 20:18:22]  <IllFlower> Yurika pauses. "I'm loath to pin this on someone I mostly know for having a dead daughter, but the facts will be the facts."
[13-Jun-2015 20:19:13]  <Calica> A year ago?  Ayako's eyes narrow a bit as she thinks.  He's probably not working alone.
[13-Jun-2015 20:21:02]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@232.166-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[13-Jun-2015 20:21:22]  <Rig> "He resigned? And he still has pull in the council?"
[13-Jun-2015 20:21:28]  <Icon> "Are you willing to help?"
[13-Jun-2015 20:22:05]  <Calica> "If he resigned a year ago and still has enough pull to convince a familiar to retire..."
[13-Jun-2015 20:22:56]  <IllFlower> Rig: "That wouldn't surprise me. The way things are structured, one Prophet's will is enough to make a decision, so long as no one else is in opposition."
[13-Jun-2015 20:24:57]  <IllFlower> Yurika suddenly snaps her fingers. "Let me tell you what. We should talk to the Librarian. I don't know if you know this, but she's also in charge of the Order's records. They might give us an idea of who to press for information."
[13-Jun-2015 20:25:33]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@232.166-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[13-Jun-2015 20:26:10]  <Rig> "Wouldn't that risk revealing ourselves before we're ready?"
[13-Jun-2015 20:27:16]  <Calica> "Depends on if we can trust the Librarian."
[13-Jun-2015 20:27:21]  <IllFlower> "You think someone would catch wind of us doing this?"
[13-Jun-2015 20:28:50]  <Rig> "I just don't want to give Miyami a chance to get away."
[13-Jun-2015 20:29:00]  <Rig> *Miyama
[13-Jun-2015 20:31:23]  <IllFlower> "He can't escape that easily. Even if he's not on the Consilium Renascens anymore, he still has his responsibilities as a Prophet. A whole series of alarm bells would go off if he up and vanished."
[13-Jun-2015 20:33:28]  <Rig> "Well, if you think the Librarian can help..."
[13-Jun-2015 20:33:55]  <IllFlower> "It's better than nothing, isn't it?" Yurika says, a little too cheerily.
[13-Jun-2015 20:34:10]  <Icon> "I can't think of any other option, and scanning the Library seems like our easiest option right now."
[13-Jun-2015 20:34:29]  <Calica> Ayako nods
[13-Jun-2015 20:35:47]  <IllFlower> FFWD>>
[13-Jun-2015 20:36:32]  <IllFlower> The Library. It's quiet as usual, barring the occasional echo of footsteps through the cavernous interior.
[13-Jun-2015 20:37:04]  <IllFlower> Mai is the only one at the desk when the Conservators and Yurika arrive.
[13-Jun-2015 20:37:52]  <IllFlower> "Can I help you?" she asks, her eyes lingering just the slightest bit longer on Ayako's face.
[13-Jun-2015 20:39:16]  <Calica> "We're, uh, here for the Order's records."
[13-Jun-2015 20:39:53]  <Rig> I imagine we need more specificity.
[13-Jun-2015 20:42:01]  <Calica> Ayako feels incredibly awkward because of Mai's presence and forgot to give more details, clearly
[13-Jun-2015 20:42:04]  <IllFlower> Yurika jumps in. "These girls - and, um, him - are doing an investigation and they need access to the Consilium Renascens' transactions."
[13-Jun-2015 20:43:06]  <IllFlower> "Um, sure," Mai says, evidently somewhat flustered. "Let me go find the Librarian." She goes through the door into the Library's back offices.
[13-Jun-2015 20:44:50]  <IllFlower> A few minutes pass by, during which the assembled group looks on curiously as Ayako inexplicably squirms.
[13-Jun-2015 20:45:21]  <Icon> (Quick, Ayako, do something not-awkward!)
[13-Jun-2015 20:45:52]  <Calica> (does Ayako ever do anything not-awkward)
[13-Jun-2015 20:46:05]  <IllFlower> Deliver swift magical justice!
[13-Jun-2015 20:46:42]  <BGTB2005> (totally shipping Ayako/Mai now ;p)
[13-Jun-2015 20:46:58]  <Calica> (I thought you were totally an Ayako/Rin person though :p)
[13-Jun-2015 20:47:08]  <IllFlower> Finally, the Librarian emerges from the door, with Mai trailing.
[13-Jun-2015 20:47:37]  <BGTB2005> (still am; let's see who manages to win Ayako's heart)
[13-Jun-2015 20:47:41]  <IllFlower> "Oh, Miss Mukai," the Librarian says in greeting. "I was wondering who it was."
[13-Jun-2015 20:49:24]  <IllFlower> She waves over to the Conservators. "Let me show you to the archives."
[13-Jun-2015 20:51:10]  <IllFlower> The route is long and convoluted, through a door in the back offices that leads to an underground staircase, where the dungeon-like quality of the original basement levels gives way to a strikingly modern-looking bunker.
[13-Jun-2015 20:52:05]  <Rig> I was hoping for a salt mine.
[13-Jun-2015 20:52:08]  <Rig> In Japan.
[13-Jun-2015 20:52:23]  <IllFlower> It feels more like walking to a completely different neighborhood than a single building.
[13-Jun-2015 20:52:27]  <IllFlower> Maybe it is.
[13-Jun-2015 20:52:48]  <Calica> The archives are made out of salt.
[13-Jun-2015 20:53:21]  <Rig> "I imagine the Order generates quite a lot of records," Kazuki says, mostly to himself.
[13-Jun-2015 20:54:22]  <Rig> "Are you the only person responsible for all of this?" he asks the Librarian.
[13-Jun-2015 20:54:40]  <IllFlower> "The only person, yes," she says.
[13-Jun-2015 20:55:11]  <Calica> Ayako stares at the cavernous records in a bit of awe.
[13-Jun-2015 20:56:06]  <IllFlower> Finally, the Librarian stops at a pair of double doors that seem to be made out of reinforced metal. She mutters a long string of words to herself, and the entrance doors part way to reveal...
[13-Jun-2015 20:56:06]  <Rig> Kazuki wonders if the Librarian's response was meant to imply something sinister, but decides they probably have enough going on already.
[13-Jun-2015 20:56:15]  <IllFlower> A ferret-like being sitting behind a desk.
[13-Jun-2015 20:56:25]  <Rig> Adorable.
[13-Jun-2015 20:56:30]  <BGTB2005> :3
[13-Jun-2015 20:56:33]  <Rig> Is there a mug of coffee.
[13-Jun-2015 20:56:35]  <Rig> *?
[13-Jun-2015 20:57:24]  <IllFlower> A teapot sits in one corner, and a series of fishbowl-like windows behind the creature open onto what appears to be a strange mix between a chemistry lab and an art gallery.
[13-Jun-2015 20:58:31]  <BGTB2005> are there cookies?
[13-Jun-2015 20:59:05]  <Rig> Kazuki wonders how many familiars help the Librarian down here. Does she have a small army of them carrying around tomes of knowledge about everything the Order does?
[13-Jun-2015 21:01:32]  <IllFlower> "Kyou, can you help them?" the Librarian asks the familiar, who nods in response.
[13-Jun-2015 21:02:14]  <IllFlower> He mutely pushes a sheet of paper in front of Rin, who happens to be standing the closest to the desk.
[13-Jun-2015 21:02:40]  <Calica> ("What?  This isn't a cookie at all!")
[13-Jun-2015 21:03:34]  <BGTB2005> Rin looks it over
[13-Jun-2015 21:03:55]  <IllFlower> It's blank.
[13-Jun-2015 21:04:24]  <BGTB2005> (Calica: lol, yeah pretty much)
[13-Jun-2015 21:04:50]  <IllFlower> "I think he's asking us to write down what we're looking for," Yurika says tentatively.
[13-Jun-2015 21:05:12]  <Calica> Ayako pulls out a pencil.
[13-Jun-2015 21:05:56]  <IllFlower> Does she just hold it menacingly in the air?
[13-Jun-2015 21:06:41]  <Icon> Cute.
[13-Jun-2015 21:07:16]  <IllFlower> ("EX-CALIBUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRAAAAAA")
[13-Jun-2015 21:08:03]  <Calica> She then motions to Rin to ask for the paper, and scribbles down the names of Naoki Miyama and the Consilium Renascens.
[13-Jun-2015 21:10:09]  <IllFlower> Kyou reaches under the desk and pulls out something resembling a pneumatic tube, into which he rolls up the piece of paper. He then opens up a chute on the wall behind him and drops the tube into it.
[13-Jun-2015 21:11:09]  * Rig pictures the Central Bureaucracy 
[13-Jun-2015 21:11:35]  <IllFlower> A low humming noise fills the room. In the lab-like space visible through the window, the various tubes of liquid begin to glow and pulsate different colors.
[13-Jun-2015 21:12:03]  <IllFlower> "It's like a rave..." Yurika says.
[13-Jun-2015 21:13:14]  <IllFlower> Various images cycle through the framed portraits on the back wall.
[13-Jun-2015 21:14:32]  <Rig> Kazuki feels a little dizzy.
[13-Jun-2015 21:15:29]  <Icon> Hikari is pretty unperturbed, though can tell Ayako and Rin aren't the biggest fans.
[13-Jun-2015 21:15:30]  <IllFlower> Then, suddenly, the whole scene calms down again, and from somewhere a jarringly cheerful synthesized tune plays. Kyou opens the chute again, retrieving a stack of parchment leaves from inside and setting it on the desk.
[13-Jun-2015 21:16:48]  <IllFlower> He returns to his seat and stares blankly at Ayako in front of him.
[13-Jun-2015 21:16:57]  <Rig> What a weird little guy.
[13-Jun-2015 21:17:16]  <BGTB2005> are there any familiars that aren't?
[13-Jun-2015 21:17:23]  <Calica> BGTB2005: no
[13-Jun-2015 21:17:43]  <IllFlower> Asacchi was pretty normal and that just freaked you all out more.
[13-Jun-2015 21:17:45]  <Calica> Ayako picks up the parchment leaves and starts looking through them
[13-Jun-2015 21:18:36]  <IllFlower> There are minutes from the council's meetings, dating from the previous January.
[13-Jun-2015 21:18:42]  <BGTB2005> I think Shii's rather normal, but that could just be because we've spent so much time serving under her
[13-Jun-2015 21:19:04]  <Rig> I liked Asacchi.
[13-Jun-2015 21:19:24]  <Rig> Kazuki tries to look at the records over Ayako's shoulder.
[13-Jun-2015 21:19:25]  <IllFlower> Coincidentally enough, or perhaps not, the oldest entry concerns Naoki Miyama's resignation.
[13-Jun-2015 21:19:46]  <IllFlower> He had apparently been a member for six years.
[13-Jun-2015 21:21:00]  <Rig> Is there a reason mentioned at all?
[13-Jun-2015 21:22:19]  <IllFlower> It was apparently a voluntary resignation. No particular reason is given, aside from some platitudes about moving aside for the next generation.
[13-Jun-2015 21:22:22]  <Calica> And was the resignation recent or, like, yesterday
[13-Jun-2015 21:23:00]  <IllFlower> A year ago, like Yurika said.
[13-Jun-2015 21:23:23]  <Calica> Oh, so that was his resignation from the Prophets as a whole?
[13-Jun-2015 21:23:36]  <IllFlower> No, just from the council.
[13-Jun-2015 21:23:47]  <Calica> oh, whoops, confused myself
[13-Jun-2015 21:25:13]  <IllFlower> Ayako flips through. She recognizes a name or two in the intervening months, before she finally lands on a dossier for Hiroko Shimamura, one of the murder victims.
[13-Jun-2015 21:26:32]  <IllFlower> "Marked as candidate by a vote of the Consilium Renascens: 1 in favor, 12 abstaining, none opposed."
[13-Jun-2015 21:27:10]  <Rig> A good council meeting.
[13-Jun-2015 21:27:33]  <Calica> "Hmmm.  You said this is common among the councils, yes, Yurika?"
[13-Jun-2015 21:27:55]  <IllFlower> "I wouldn't say *common*, but possible, yes..."
[13-Jun-2015 21:30:44]  <IllFlower> Below is a list of names. A certain Takako Murata stands alone in the roll call.
[13-Jun-2015 21:31:15]  <Rig> "Only one member even appeared at this meeting?"
[13-Jun-2015 21:32:47]  <IllFlower> The dossiers for Takumi Oonishi, Chiaki, and a handful of others look the same. Six in all.
[13-Jun-2015 21:33:28]  <Calica> We're not supposed to recognize the name Takako Murata, are we?
[13-Jun-2015 21:33:31]  <IllFlower> No.
[13-Jun-2015 21:33:47]  *** Medicine <~Victor@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[13-Jun-2015 21:33:59]  *** Medicine <~Victor@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has joined #madokamadness
[13-Jun-2015 21:37:14]  <Rig> "Takako Murata must be doing Miyama's dirty work then?"
[13-Jun-2015 21:37:52]  <IllFlower> "Sounds like it," Yurika says. "Whoever she is."
[13-Jun-2015 21:39:45]  <Rig> "She'd have to be another Prophet, right? It shouldn't be too hard to find her."
[13-Jun-2015 21:40:15]  <IllFlower> Yurika nods, then pauses.
[13-Jun-2015 21:41:06]  <IllFlower> "What I don't get is how nobody's noticed this pattern yet. It's blindingly obvious if you look at the records, but I haven't heard anything about an investigation.
[13-Jun-2015 21:41:23]  <IllFlower> "How is it that the Conservators are the ones looking at this?"
[13-Jun-2015 21:41:55]  <Calica> "I...have no idea.  I have no idea."
[13-Jun-2015 21:42:56]  <IllFlower> Good answer.
[13-Jun-2015 21:43:29]  <IllFlower> So what do we want to do now?
[13-Jun-2015 21:43:44]  <Rig> Perhaps confront Murata?
[13-Jun-2015 21:44:02]  <BGTB2005> I think gathering information first might be a good idea
[13-Jun-2015 21:44:19]  <Icon> Same.
[13-Jun-2015 21:45:54]  <Calica> what sort of information?
[13-Jun-2015 21:48:09]  <BGTB2005> anything that has to do with both her and Naoki?
[13-Jun-2015 21:48:46]  <Rig> How would we gather it? More record searches?
[13-Jun-2015 21:51:54]  <BGTB2005> ...yes(?)
[13-Jun-2015 21:51:55]  <IllFlower> I kinda like confrontation. Confrontation is fun.
[13-Jun-2015 21:52:33]  <IllFlower> Circumspection hardly befits our unsubtle protagonists. ;)
[13-Jun-2015 21:53:11]  <Icon> So we gonna go yell at and/or punch someone
[13-Jun-2015 21:53:13]  <BGTB2005> still I think having at least some more evidence of any dealings between the two would help
[13-Jun-2015 21:53:29]  <Calica> "Do you know how we'd locate this Murata?"
[13-Jun-2015 21:56:33]  <IllFlower> "Well, the dangerous way would be to go to a session of the council..."
[13-Jun-2015 21:58:53]  <Rig> "That seems incredibly unsubtle."
[13-Jun-2015 21:59:07]  <Rig> "Just our style, I guess."
[13-Jun-2015 21:59:13]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[13-Jun-2015 21:59:16]  <Calica> I can just imagine Rin setting fire to the entire council
[13-Jun-2015 22:00:15]  <IllFlower> What's the plan?
[13-Jun-2015 22:00:16]  <BGTB2005> She'd...yeah, that seems perfectly proportionate in her mind; they try to endanger her big sister, they get set on fire
[13-Jun-2015 22:00:37]  <Rig> I suppose going to a meeting might be worthwhile. Confrontation would be nice.
[13-Jun-2015 22:00:53]  <Icon> Oh golly.
[13-Jun-2015 22:02:37]  <IllFlower> All right, let's do that, then.
[13-Jun-2015 22:02:56]  <IllFlower> FFWD>>
[13-Jun-2015 22:03:37]  <Rig> Kazuki is gonna ursurp a spot on the council.
[13-Jun-2015 22:03:40]  <Rig> *usurp
[13-Jun-2015 22:03:41]  <IllFlower> That Thursday, Yurika guides the Conservators to the observers' gallery in the council chambers.
[13-Jun-2015 22:04:05]  <Calica> Kazuki's dad just stares him down and he gets so freaked out he leaves the Conservators
[13-Jun-2015 22:04:21]  <IllFlower> The gallery is a balcony around the circular main room. At the center is an equally circular table.
[13-Jun-2015 22:05:25]  <IllFlower> The council members file in one by one, coming in at a seemingly leisurely pace. Most are dressed in robes, though a couple are in Western business clothes and one woman wears a kimono.
[13-Jun-2015 22:06:11]  <Calica> i'm guessing not with a leather jacket though
[13-Jun-2015 22:06:14]  <IllFlower> The last seat is empty for some time. The councilors chat among themselves for some time.
[13-Jun-2015 22:06:20]  <IllFlower> For some time. Yeah.
[13-Jun-2015 22:06:46]  <IllFlower> To fill in the time, I mean. Though even after twenty minutes have passed, the chair is still unoccupied.
[13-Jun-2015 22:07:06]  <Rig> Kazuki starts to eye the empty chair.
[13-Jun-2015 22:07:20]  <IllFlower> @dice roll d4
[13-Jun-2015 22:07:20]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 2 = 2.
[13-Jun-2015 22:07:47]  <IllFlower> As the initiates wait, Hikari notices that something is off.
[13-Jun-2015 22:07:52]  <Rig> How many people are around us? Is this a well attended thing?
[13-Jun-2015 22:08:19]  <IllFlower> There were thirteen votes on the dossier, but there are only twelve chairs at the table.
[13-Jun-2015 22:08:41]  <IllFlower> Rig: Not really. The lateness doesn't seem all that unusual, either.
[13-Jun-2015 22:09:01]  <Calica> i guess that's how murata was able to get those 1-0-12 votes
[13-Jun-2015 22:09:31]  <Rig> Kazuki sighs and peers down at the council trying to see if he remembers any of them as family friends.
[13-Jun-2015 22:10:17]  <IllFlower> Finally, the straggler comes in, an old man in insanely purple velvet, and starts the meeting.
[13-Jun-2015 22:10:33]  <Calica> clearly Fiora designed the outfits
[13-Jun-2015 22:10:56]  <Rig> "Which one is Murata?"
[13-Jun-2015 22:11:48]  <Icon> "... this seems rather suspect to me." Hikari chimes in from behind, seemingly at random. "The numbers for the votes and the chairs don't add up."
[13-Jun-2015 22:11:55]  <IllFlower> "I apologize for my lateness. Let us begin the meeting. All members present," he says.
[13-Jun-2015 22:12:45]  <Rig> "What do you mean Hikari?" Kazuki whispers.
[13-Jun-2015 22:15:10]  <Icon> "Look below, Kazuki." she motions back, in turn. "The vote included 13 members altogether, and there are only 12 present. Don't you think such a change would have been notified by somebody, somewhere?"
[13-Jun-2015 22:15:28]  <Calica> psst, number 13 just arrived
[13-Jun-2015 22:15:35]  <Icon> Rewind that
[13-Jun-2015 22:15:42]  <Icon> Or maybe I phrased that badly
[13-Jun-2015 22:15:46]  <IllFlower> There are still only twelve chairs.
[13-Jun-2015 22:15:53]  <Icon> I meant the 13 votes v 12 chairs. :V
[13-Jun-2015 22:15:58]  <Calica> oh, whoops, twelve chairs
[13-Jun-2015 22:16:02]  <Icon> Yeah. >_<
[13-Jun-2015 22:16:03]  <Calica> I misunderstood >_<
[13-Jun-2015 22:16:45]  <Rig> "Are the votes being modified after the fact then?"
[13-Jun-2015 22:18:17]  <Icon> "That's what I thought of. At any rate, it doesn't seem very cleanly done to me..." Hikari mumbles back, somewhat hissing near the end.
[13-Jun-2015 22:20:21]  <Icon> (I assume they all just hushed up while Mr. Purple begins talking.)
[13-Jun-2015 22:23:17]  <Rig> Does Mr. Purple have anything interesting to say?

[13-Jun-2015 22:26:08]  <IllFlower> "First on the agenda," a woman says, "is a vote on extending the moratorium put in place for recruitment from Tama West High School that we enacted in the wake of the recent incidents there."
[13-Jun-2015 22:26:27]  <Calica> that's the school Chiaki goes to, right?
[13-Jun-2015 22:26:36]  <Rig> I believe so.
[13-Jun-2015 22:26:46]  <IllFlower> Indeed.

[13-Jun-2015 22:28:24]  <Calica> so are they going to debabte/vote?
[13-Jun-2015 22:28:31]  <IllFlower> "We should continue with it until at least the beginning of next month," a man says.
[13-Jun-2015 22:28:34]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@CPEbc4dfb91a083-CMbc4dfb91a080.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 198 seconds)
[13-Jun-2015 22:28:39]  <IllFlower> There's a general murmur of assent at the table.
[13-Jun-2015 22:28:59]  <Rig> Should we maybe tell them that they're being hoodwinked?
[13-Jun-2015 22:29:21]  <IllFlower> A quick voice vote reveals no dissent.
[13-Jun-2015 22:31:37]  <IllFlower> The meeting seems to move on to individual candidates. The first is a thirteen-year-old girl with a flowery name from one of the eastern wards.
[13-Jun-2015 22:32:16]  <IllFlower> Yurika looks at Kazuki. "This doesn't add up," she says, stating the obvious.
[13-Jun-2015 22:32:59]  <Rig> "I doubt that Murata is even here. Who handles the record keeping for meetings like these?"
[13-Jun-2015 22:33:06]  <Calica> "Murata must be forging records or something."
[13-Jun-2015 22:34:51]  <IllFlower> "The council keeps and sends in their own minutes."
[13-Jun-2015 22:35:30]  <IllFlower> A troubled look stretches over Yurika's face.
[13-Jun-2015 22:36:31]  <IllFlower> "Ayako's right. I assume the records are being tampered with after the fact.
[13-Jun-2015 22:37:03]  <IllFlower> "And then... presented to the familiars as falsified proof?
[13-Jun-2015 22:37:48]  <IllFlower> "He must be talking to them directly."
[13-Jun-2015 22:38:30]  <Rig> "How is that possible? Aren't there any checks?"
[13-Jun-2015 22:40:18]  <IllFlower> "He was a former member of the council...
[13-Jun-2015 22:40:31]  <Calica> "How are the records sent to the familiars?  Is there any way we could confront them there?"
[13-Jun-2015 22:40:31]  <IllFlower> "I assume nobody thought they were necessary.
[13-Jun-2015 22:41:14]  <IllFlower> "Very trusting..." Yurika shakes her head.
[13-Jun-2015 22:41:59]  <IllFlower> Calica: "I think they're hand-delivered to the Library."
[13-Jun-2015 22:42:37]  <Rig> "So we intercept the fakes?"
[13-Jun-2015 22:43:21]  <Calica> "That seems like our best bet."  Ayako looks around at the others.
[13-Jun-2015 22:43:30]  <Icon> "I am up for that."
[13-Jun-2015 22:44:10]  <BGTB2005> Rin nods in agreement
[13-Jun-2015 22:45:13]  <IllFlower> "We wait until the meeting ends, then?"
[13-Jun-2015 22:45:52]  <Rig> "Yes. And we follow whoever is delivering the minutes."
[13-Jun-2015 22:46:26]  <IllFlower> Ooh, is this a following conflict?
[13-Jun-2015 22:46:27]  <IllFlower> I love those.
[13-Jun-2015 22:46:37]  <Rig> Is that a serious thing?
[13-Jun-2015 22:46:44]  <IllFlower> I'm kidding.
[13-Jun-2015 22:46:51]  <Calica> we've done 'em a couple times I think
[13-Jun-2015 22:46:54]  <Calica> followed someone as a conflict
[13-Jun-2015 22:46:56]  <Rig> I was hoping we'd just skip to jumping the guy.
[13-Jun-2015 22:46:57]  <IllFlower> We did do that with Minami.
[13-Jun-2015 22:47:02]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[13-Jun-2015 22:48:32]  <IllFlower> The man in the purple robes is the last to leave after the meeting ends. He spends a few minutes scribbling on the parchment holding today's records, then beckons to someone standing outside the chamber door to come in.
[13-Jun-2015 22:49:20]  <IllFlower> A young woman, maybe Kazuki or Yurika's age, walks in and accepts the papers from the man.
[13-Jun-2015 22:49:34]  <IllFlower> A few pleasantries are exchanged, and then the two of them leave the room.
[13-Jun-2015 22:50:34]  <BGTB2005> how far down is the room from the balcony?
[13-Jun-2015 22:50:55]  <IllFlower> About five meters.
[13-Jun-2015 22:51:06]  <Calica> I think Rin's considering flying over
[13-Jun-2015 22:51:31]  <BGTB2005> well it seems like the shortest route to pursue
[13-Jun-2015 22:52:54]  <Calica> yeah but you're desecrating the prophets' halls (which Rin doesn't care about tbf)
[13-Jun-2015 22:54:11]  <BGTB2005> so? (and yeah you're probably right about that part)
[13-Jun-2015 22:54:50]  <IllFlower> Let's, uh, let's do this outside...
[13-Jun-2015 22:55:45]  <BGTB2005> ...okay :<
[13-Jun-2015 22:55:52]  <IllFlower> Or at least just jump to the part where you're confronting the woman.
[13-Jun-2015 22:56:27]  <Rig> I mean, we can do a following conflict, but they always turn out weird.
[13-Jun-2015 22:56:49]  <IllFlower> Do you want to confront her, or just follow her?
[13-Jun-2015 22:56:52]  <BGTB2005> I for one would kinda like a pursuit conflict, at least one where we don't proceed immediately to blowing things up
[13-Jun-2015 22:56:55]  <IllFlower> You do kinda know where she's going.
[13-Jun-2015 22:56:58]  <Calica> I was expecting to confront her outside
[13-Jun-2015 22:57:03]  <Rig> Kinda want to confront her.
[13-Jun-2015 22:57:15]  <Calica> Like, ambush her at the outside of the Library or something
[13-Jun-2015 22:57:19]  <BGTB2005> confronting her is fine too
[13-Jun-2015 22:57:20]  <IllFlower> You don't have to proceed to blowing things up. We have these things called "words." :p
[13-Jun-2015 22:57:40]  <BGTB2005> but rin is involved
[13-Jun-2015 22:57:47]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I don't know what you'd want out of the conflict, so someone set that scene.
[13-Jun-2015 22:58:24]  <Calica> I think we want her to give up her connections to Naoki as well as stop forging etc
[13-Jun-2015 22:58:47]  <Rig> Yeah, that'd be ideal. Getting her to spill on Naoki would be good.
[13-Jun-2015 22:59:06]  <Rig> Should I lead us in if that's what we're going for?
[13-Jun-2015 22:59:18]  <IllFlower> Well, let's start the scene and we'll go to conflict once we hit conflict-y things.
[13-Jun-2015 22:59:33]  <IllFlower> Don't forget to introduce yourselves! :D
[13-Jun-2015 23:00:11]  <Rig> I meant lead us into the scene, not the conflict.
[13-Jun-2015 23:00:16]  <Rig> :P
[13-Jun-2015 23:00:55]  <IllFlower> Oh. Then proceed.
[13-Jun-2015 23:02:44]  <Rig> Yurika and the Conservators hurry ahead of the young woman, anticipating her arrival at the library. They're waiting outside for her when she strolls up. "Excuse me," Kazuki says, stepping in her path. "I am Sakura Kazuki, a Conservator. Do you have a minute?"
[13-Jun-2015 23:02:48]  <Rig> Good?
[13-Jun-2015 23:03:45]  <IllFlower> The woman looks up at Kazuki. "What's the matter," she says in a distressing monotone.
[13-Jun-2015 23:04:02]  * Rig tries to imagine a distressing monotone.
[13-Jun-2015 23:04:55]  <Calica> "Were you the one delivering the reports for the council?"
[13-Jun-2015 23:05:14]  <Rig> "The last Consilium Renascens meeting, she means." Kazuki clarifies.
[13-Jun-2015 23:05:21]  <IllFlower> "Yes. I am their courier."
[13-Jun-2015 23:05:43]  <Rig> "What's your name?"
[13-Jun-2015 23:06:04]  <IllFlower> "Murata."
[13-Jun-2015 23:06:44]  <Rig> "We believe that the minutes you're delivering have been tampered with, Murata."
[13-Jun-2015 23:06:58]  <IllFlower> "How so."
[13-Jun-2015 23:07:07]  <Rig> Kazuki smiles and tries not to alarm her. "We were hoping we could take a look to find out."
[13-Jun-2015 23:08:02]  <IllFlower> "These are direct transcriptions.
[13-Jun-2015 23:08:08]  <IllFlower> "Nothing could have taken place."
[13-Jun-2015 23:08:31]  <Calica> "Then you should have no problem letting us look at them."
[13-Jun-2015 23:09:16]  <IllFlower> Murata's eyes flick from Kazuki to Ayako and back.
[13-Jun-2015 23:09:33]  <IllFlower> She finally hands the stack of parchment over.
[13-Jun-2015 23:10:02]  <Rig> Kazuki takes a look at the parchment, checking to see if it does indeed match the events at the meeting.
[13-Jun-2015 23:10:21]  <IllFlower> It doesn't take long for him to notice that the very first item of business, the moratorium, is missing.
[13-Jun-2015 23:10:40]  <Rig> Does it have her voting for things in it?
[13-Jun-2015 23:11:16]  <IllFlower> Not that he can see.
[13-Jun-2015 23:11:25]  <BGTB2005> I think the missing first item is kind of a higher priority?
[13-Jun-2015 23:11:42]  <Rig> I wanted to have evidence that she was the forger.
[13-Jun-2015 23:12:21]  <Calica> Well, the fact that someone who probably isn't a prophet is on these lists is pretty strong evidence already
[13-Jun-2015 23:12:32]  <Rig> Kazuki frowns and passes the parchment to Ayako. "Were you at the meeting, Murata?"
[13-Jun-2015 23:12:56]  <IllFlower> "As before. I am only their courier."
[13-Jun-2015 23:13:28]  <Calica> Ayako continues to look through the parchment as Kazuki engages Murata.
[13-Jun-2015 23:14:02]  <Icon> (I... I am not here. I haven't known what to say, sorry.)
[13-Jun-2015 23:14:18]  <IllFlower> "Is there a problem," Murata asks flatly.
[13-Jun-2015 23:14:21]  <Rig> "I can tell you that these transcripts aren't accurate. And perhaps it would surprise you to find out that your name is in previous transcripts of these meetings as a voting member of Consilium Renascens?"
[13-Jun-2015 23:14:49]  <IllFlower> No response. Not even a monotone one.

[13-Jun-2015 23:16:21]  <Rig> "Murata, are you all right?" Kazuki is fairly certain that this is not the reaction he expected.
[13-Jun-2015 23:17:12]  <IllFlower> "I am the key," she says.
[13-Jun-2015 23:17:23]  <Rig> (Zuul?)
[13-Jun-2015 23:17:37]  <IllFlower> lol
[13-Jun-2015 23:18:01]  <Rig> Kazuki isn't really certain how to respond to that. He looks to Hikari, Rin, and Ayako. "Um?"
[13-Jun-2015 23:18:25]  <IllFlower> Do you want to go all "J'accuse !" yet?
[13-Jun-2015 23:19:05]  <IllFlower> s/Hikari, Rin, and Ayako/his magical harem/
[13-Jun-2015 23:19:24]  <Icon> Hikari raises an eyebrow. "Excuse me, Murata. Would you care to explain more clearly?"
[13-Jun-2015 23:19:38]  <Rig> I don't think Kazuki is particularly convinced that she's entirely responsible anymore.
[13-Jun-2015 23:19:54]  <Rig> She seems kinda possessed, but maybe I'm reading too much into it.
[13-Jun-2015 23:20:00]  <IllFlower> Not one for taking silence as admission of guilt, eh?
[13-Jun-2015 23:20:11]  <Calica> Something's definitely up, at least
[13-Jun-2015 23:20:12]  <Icon> Hikari think she's dubious at best.
[13-Jun-2015 23:20:20]  <IllFlower> "History is locked, and I am the key."
[13-Jun-2015 23:20:52]  <Rig> Kazuki pauses and stares at the woman for a moment. "Okay, and how do we unlock history?"
[13-Jun-2015 23:20:55]  <BGTB2005> could we detain her and question her later?
[13-Jun-2015 23:22:37]  <Calica> BGTB2005: We could but the question is if we'd actually get anything out of it
[13-Jun-2015 23:23:43]  <IllFlower> "The father turns the key. The daughter is locked away."
[13-Jun-2015 23:24:25]  <IllFlower> Murata's eyes narrow.
[13-Jun-2015 23:25:04]  <BGTB2005> Calica: Rin really just wants to punch Murata in the face, plus isn't that what conflict is for?
[13-Jun-2015 23:25:30]  <Icon> I think knocking her out would be a little counter-productive.
[13-Jun-2015 23:25:34]  <IllFlower> "The key is obstructed. It cannot turn.
[13-Jun-2015 23:25:37]  <IllFlower> "The father has a name. The father's name is Naoki.
[13-Jun-2015 23:25:46]  <IllFlower> "The daughter has a name. The daughter's name is Sena.
[13-Jun-2015 23:25:57]  <IllFlower> "The key has a name. The key's name is Takako.
[13-Jun-2015 23:26:09]  <IllFlower> "The obstruction has a name. The obstruction's name is Kazuki."

[13-Jun-2015 23:26:53]  <BGTB2005> maybe knocking ehr out would be very productive
[13-Jun-2015 23:28:15]  <IllFlower> Murata's body begins to twitch and writhe, as if something is trying to escape from within.

[13-Jun-2015 23:32:39]  <IllFlower> I don't suppose the Conservators will quietly slip away and let the forgery continue?
[13-Jun-2015 23:33:26]  <Calica> No, I think this is time for some sort of witch cleansing

[13-Jun-2015 23:44:20]  <IllFlower> She's clearly possessed so maybe you can get some facts out of the witches.
[13-Jun-2015 23:44:26]  <BGTB2005> not die?
[13-Jun-2015 23:44:46]  <BGTB2005> information would be nice to, i guess
[13-Jun-2015 23:45:12]  <Icon> Why she's forging specifically and who she's involved with?
[13-Jun-2015 23:45:35]  <IllFlower> So "who sent you?"
[13-Jun-2015 23:45:51]  <Calica> well, we sort of know that

[14-Jun-2015 00:26:24]  <IllFlower> Any objections?
[14-Jun-2015 00:26:36]  <BGTB2005> :D
[14-Jun-2015 00:27:01]  <Icon> She sounds like a robot. Cute, imo.
[14-Jun-2015 00:27:03]  <Calica> i don't think we can object
[14-Jun-2015 00:27:09]  <Rig> Well, we'll all die, but sure.

[14-Jun-2015 00:29:26]  <IllFlower> Murata whispers something inaudible, and suddenly a cacophony of what sound like human screams pierce the Conservators' ears, loud enough to cause physical pain.
[14-Jun-2015 00:29:35]  <IllFlower> Assigning 1d8 to aural hallucinations, and...

[14-Jun-2015 00:30:08]  <Calica> "nice"
[14-Jun-2015 00:30:24]  <IllFlower> I could have raised 16!

[14-Jun-2015 00:30:41]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: If your raise or see makes use of it, yes.

[14-Jun-2015 00:31:52]  <rollermine> Rig: do something dumb
[14-Jun-2015 00:32:21]  <BGTB2005> magical whistle time?
[14-Jun-2015 00:32:32]  <Rig> Nah, that won't give me the right kind of die.
[14-Jun-2015 00:32:48]  <Rig> Gonna try something else first.
[14-Jun-2015 00:32:51]  <BGTB2005> k
[14-Jun-2015 00:33:33]  <Rig> But first I probably should ask you guys about it. I have a trait for dampening magic, can that be used to surpress all magic or just Kazuki's?
[14-Jun-2015 00:34:00]  <BGTB2005> I think its intended use was basically for magical stealth?
[14-Jun-2015 00:34:05]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[14-Jun-2015 00:34:21]  <IllFlower> You have the intuitive magic sense though.
[14-Jun-2015 00:34:25]  <Rig> Yeah.
[14-Jun-2015 00:34:31]  <Calica> Ayako remembers her previous experience with sound mages, and decides to use a similar technique to block out the noise; unfortunately, while it locks in, it took long enough to cast to still cause damage.
[14-Jun-2015 00:34:42]  <Calica> @dice use 6 4 4

[14-Jun-2015 00:34:58]  <Rig> Hm, what can I do with that inuitive sense?
[14-Jun-2015 00:35:00]  <IllFlower> 3d10 fallout.
[14-Jun-2015 00:35:28]  <IllFlower> Rig: Dispel the illusion, something like that.
[14-Jun-2015 00:35:34]  <Rig> Yeah, that might be fun.
[14-Jun-2015 00:36:23]  <Rig> Kazuki closes his eyes in pain and almost falls, but he holds on. He reaches out with his natural senses and tries to find some way to shut out this dark magic.
[14-Jun-2015 00:36:23]  <IllFlower> Need some sees from BGTB2005 and Icon as well.
[14-Jun-2015 00:36:29]  <Rig> @dice add d10

[14-Jun-2015 00:36:50]  <BGTB2005> nice
[14-Jun-2015 00:37:04]  <Rig> After brief moment Kazuki finds the right magical frequency and closes his power around it, shutting it off in his head.
[14-Jun-2015 00:37:09]  <Icon> Sorry, I had to answer a call from my mother.
[14-Jun-2015 00:37:10]  <Rig> @dice use 10 4

[14-Jun-2015 00:37:33]  <IllFlower> High dice unless someone wants to go first.
[14-Jun-2015 00:37:55]  <Calica> hmm, I probably could have activated witchy mode there too
[14-Jun-2015 00:38:09]  <Icon> Should I bring in my staff perhaps?
[14-Jun-2015 00:38:17]  <Calica> To see? no
[14-Jun-2015 00:38:24]  <Rig> I have an idea that I'd like to try, but I don't want to jump in too quickly if someone else has any ideas.
[14-Jun-2015 00:38:26]  <Icon> Right.
[14-Jun-2015 00:38:37]  <Rig> @dice show Icon

[14-Jun-2015 00:38:38]  <IllFlower> Calica: You've already done that dice-wise.
[14-Jun-2015 00:39:09]  <Calica> IllFlower: No, there's two things, the relationship, and calling on the xd10 demonic influence dice
[14-Jun-2015 00:39:10]  <Rig> Icon: Well, if you want to see with a Block you'll need at least a 9.
[14-Jun-2015 00:39:19]  <IllFlower> Oh, oh, right.
[14-Jun-2015 00:39:33]  <Rig> But it doesn't look like you have anything that'll do that.
[14-Jun-2015 00:39:54]  <Rig> So, maybe the staff is a good call. Like, you could use it to just reinforce magical shields or something like that.
[14-Jun-2015 00:40:09]  <Icon> Or tap her out of her mojo.
[14-Jun-2015 00:40:10]  <IllFlower> She'll still take fallout.
[14-Jun-2015 00:40:23]  <Rig> You can also call in the 1d4 for your fear. Yeah, but everything will cause her fallout at this point.
[14-Jun-2015 00:40:27]  <BGTB2005> one of the others could assist?
[14-Jun-2015 00:40:35]  <IllFlower> Giving *is* an option.
[14-Jun-2015 00:40:39]  <Rig> True.
[14-Jun-2015 00:40:39]  <Icon> Rig: I was thinking Allies, for obvious reasons.
[14-Jun-2015 00:40:51]  <Icon> But, hrm.
[14-Jun-2015 00:41:09]  <Rig> I mean, this is lethal levels of fallout now.
[14-Jun-2015 00:41:28]  <IllFlower> Helping will put you down a die and Murata already has an 8 to reverse most single-die raises.
[14-Jun-2015 00:41:45]  <Icon> I think giving is actually the best option, honestly.
[14-Jun-2015 00:41:51]  <Rig> I don't blame you.
[14-Jun-2015 00:42:03]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005, anything?
[14-Jun-2015 00:42:06]  <Icon> Yeah, I'll give.
[14-Jun-2015 00:42:08]  <BGTB2005> Rin falls to her knees and doubles over, her hands pressed to her ears to try and block out the screams
[14-Jun-2015 00:42:14]  <BGTB2005> @dice use 3 5 6
[14-Jun-2015 00:42:14]  <Omnipresence> 14BGTB2005: Used 3 5 6 = 14. Bank now has 1 1 1 2 3 3 4 6 = 21.

[14-Jun-2015 00:42:32]  <Rig> Anyone want to raise in particular?
[14-Jun-2015 00:42:37]  <BGTB2005> i aint fraid of no fallout
[14-Jun-2015 00:42:55]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005 has the high dice, but if you have something ready, Rig, you should go.
[14-Jun-2015 00:43:00]  <BGTB2005> (-Rin 1997-2015)
[14-Jun-2015 00:43:28]  <IllFlower> FIFTEEN MINUTES
[14-Jun-2015 00:43:45]  <Icon> Hikari motions to force Murata out of her attack, before the ringing forces her onto her knees, shaking.
[14-Jun-2015 00:44:19]  <Icon> So that's... 53322? :v
[14-Jun-2015 00:44:31]  <IllFlower> I thought you were giving.
[14-Jun-2015 00:44:35]  <Rig> Kazuki reaches into his pocket and pulls out a whistle. He's never used it, but for some reason he feels it is important to use it now. He puts the golden whistle to his lips and blows. No sound escapes.

[14-Jun-2015 00:45:36]  <Rig> Kazuki hopes the whistle is enough to dispell Murata's posession.

[14-Jun-2015 00:46:58]  <Rig> Clearing the mind or whatnot.
[14-Jun-2015 00:47:39]  <IllFlower> The young woman tries to concentrate her magic as a defense against Kazuki's attack.
[14-Jun-2015 00:47:46]  <IllFlower> Going to assign 1d4 to focus.

[14-Jun-2015 00:48:27]  <Rig> I roll well this time, so it had to happen.
[14-Jun-2015 00:48:30]  <Rig> *rolled
[14-Jun-2015 00:48:35]  <IllFlower> I'm going to give.
[14-Jun-2015 00:48:51]  <Rig> Meanwhile, Kazuki has to rush everyone to the hospital.
[14-Jun-2015 00:49:05]  <Calica> well that depends on how fallout goes
[14-Jun-2015 00:49:14]  <IllFlower> Murata collapses flat on her back, holding her head in pain. Looks like the whistle worked.
[14-Jun-2015 00:49:42]  <IllFlower> A large black cloud violently expels itself from her mouth and evaporates into the air.

[14-Jun-2015 00:51:42]  <IllFlower> That was gonna happen, wasn't it.
[14-Jun-2015 00:51:42]  <Calica> iirc it's top three dice
[14-Jun-2015 00:52:04]  <IllFlower> Who wants to heal Ayako within the next seven minutes?
[14-Jun-2015 00:52:22]  <Calica> i think we can make it a cliffhanger

[14-Jun-2015 00:52:51]  <Rig> ;-;
[14-Jun-2015 00:53:08]  <IllFlower> Okay, then cliffhang we shall.
[14-Jun-2015 00:53:18]  <BGTB2005> Rin volunteers
[14-Jun-2015 00:53:20]  <IllFlower> Isn't that great? After six hours something exciting happened.
[14-Jun-2015 00:53:32]  <Icon> ._.
[14-Jun-2015 00:53:40]  <IllFlower> We'll pick up next time with Rin trying to save Ayako's life.
[14-Jun-2015 00:53:50]  <Calica> The question is, who should be yelling "AYAKOOOOOOOO!" running towards her as her body collapses
[14-Jun-2015 00:53:52]  <Rig> IllFlower: Sorry that was so long.
[14-Jun-2015 00:53:56]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, everyone.
