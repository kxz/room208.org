@time=2014-07-20T20:19:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So before we dive in, a program note...
@time=2014-07-20T20:19:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In order to spare us all from having to remember another name, I'm arbitrarily moving everything that happened last session to Kikugawa, a.k.a. the town we've always been in.
@time=2014-07-20T20:20:12.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mkay.
@time=2014-07-20T20:20:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I recall everyone was planning on following Yuuya, our celebrity of the moment, back to his hometown.
@time=2014-07-20T20:20:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We'll let that be Miyahama.
@time=2014-07-20T20:20:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's all. Any questions?
@time=2014-07-20T20:20:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Good. That means one less name I have to look up everytime I want to remember what I’m talking about/to
@time=2014-07-20T20:21:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I hope you've been keeping notes.
@time=2014-07-20T20:21:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("Yuuya: GODDAMMIT ILLFLOWER JUST CALL HIM BOB")
@time=2014-07-20T20:21:55.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :that fucker. there he is. god, what a tool.
@time=2014-07-20T20:22:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway.
@time=2014-07-20T20:23:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So what's the plan? Getting off the train and stumbling around randomly would be funny but ineffectual.
@time=2014-07-20T20:24:01.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Good point.
@time=2014-07-20T20:24:16.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, what's our goal, again?  To find out more about the attacks, right?
@time=2014-07-20T20:24:31.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :think so
@time=2014-07-20T20:24:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Don't ask me. They're *your* objectives. :p
@time=2014-07-20T20:24:59.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was asking the other players
@time=2014-07-20T20:25:09.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki’s objective is to become prophet.
@time=2014-07-20T20:25:36.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("he wants to crash the confirmation and get the prophetship himself")
@time=2014-07-20T20:25:56.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But in the short term we were trying to figure out who would fake a witch about a rumor of Kotomi.
@time=2014-07-20T20:26:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He's going to kill Yuuya and wear his body to the confirmation.
@time=2014-07-20T20:26:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, except not.
@time=2014-07-20T20:26:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Misread not as “hot”
@time=2014-07-20T20:26:52.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Was confused about IllFlower’s kinks.
@time=2014-07-20T20:27:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Are you JackMackerel?
@time=2014-07-20T20:27:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I get really into roleplaying.
@time=2014-07-20T20:27:52.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :...
@time=2014-07-20T20:28:49.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe we should go harangue those involved in the prophetship. No...
@time=2014-07-20T20:28:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, in any case, there's Yuuya, his familiar, Mukai... lots of options.
@time=2014-07-20T20:29:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let’s talk to his familiar!
@time=2014-07-20T20:30:09.000Z :SpruceZeus PART #madokamadness
@time=2014-07-20T20:30:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sure, why not.
@time=2014-07-20T20:30:33.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ask if Mukai knows if anyone wanted Yuuya dead?
@time=2014-07-20T20:31:10.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, the attacks seem to be following Yuuya.
@time=2014-07-20T20:31:18.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let’s see if he has any info on it.
@time=2014-07-20T20:31:27.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :See who would want to. Affiliations and whatnot.
@time=2014-07-20T20:31:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So who are we seeing?
@time=2014-07-20T20:31:42.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mean, someone has something out for him.
@time=2014-07-20T20:31:49.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mukai I think.
@time=2014-07-20T20:32:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I remember you guys wanted to arrange security anyway...
@time=2014-07-20T20:33:03.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.  So talking to Mukai about the threat on Yuuya's life is probably the best idea for now
@time=2014-07-20T20:33:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Then off we go.
@time=2014-07-20T20:35:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :After defeating the bridge witch, the Conservators make arrangements to meet Yuuya's sponsor Mukai in Miyahama, who elects to meet them in a plaza near the shopping district.
@time=2014-07-20T20:36:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The place is, unsurprisingly, fairly crowded, and scarcely anyone pays any heed to the group as they make their way over to an umbrella-covered table where Mukai is waiting.
@time=2014-07-20T20:37:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She's dressed remarkably casually for a prophet, funnily enough.
@time=2014-07-20T20:38:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako recognizes her as Yurika. So it *was* that Mukai.
@time=2014-07-20T20:39:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"One, two, three... oh, if it isn't Ayako!" she says, as they all take their seats.
@time=2014-07-20T20:39:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"So you're a Conservator now? Good, good, good." She nods to herself in satisfaction.
@time=2014-07-20T20:40:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What's the story? You wanted to talk to me about Kinomoto, right?"
@time=2014-07-20T20:41:35.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Mmhmm.  We believe he's being targeted."
@time=2014-07-20T20:44:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"By Kotomi Taniguchi, right?" Yurika asks. She seems unperturbed by the idea.
@time=2014-07-20T20:46:13.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She's our only lead so far. I take it you're familiar with her?"
@time=2014-07-20T20:47:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Something like that. I wouldn't be doing my job if I weren't.
@time=2014-07-20T20:47:33.000Z :Juan QUIT :Quit: Leaving.
@time=2014-07-20T20:47:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It seems fishy, though. The evidence doesn't point to her so much as vaguely gesture."
@time=2014-07-20T20:48:21.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The remnants were also...strange.  Didn't quite feel the same as Kotomi did."
@time=2014-07-20T20:49:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Feel? You know what she feels like?"
@time=2014-07-20T20:49:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's an odd question, but Yurika asks it with an entirely straight face.
@time=2014-07-20T20:50:19.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, that sounded more like innuendo than I was expecting.
@time=2014-07-20T20:51:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :<age years="5">You started it!</age>
@time=2014-07-20T20:52:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Should I ask a different question?
@time=2014-07-20T20:52:52.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako's facade cracks a bit; it's obvious what she's thinking about now.  "I...was one of the Conservators there when she escaped.  The other two..."
@time=2014-07-20T20:53:09.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :nah, I was just trying to think of the best way to say that sentence.
@time=2014-07-20T20:53:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Ah..." Yurika shakes her head.
@time=2014-07-20T20:55:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She goes silent for a moment.
@time=2014-07-20T20:55:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Anyway.
@time=2014-07-20T20:56:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm concerned, but right now it doesn't seem like there's enough to go on to be anything beyond that.
@time=2014-07-20T20:56:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"As far as things go, I'm more worried about what Kinomoto might do to his own chances."
@time=2014-07-20T20:57:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yurika sighs. "He's not exactly great with advice."
@time=2014-07-20T20:57:10.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"He had some relation to Kotomi, didn't he?"
@time=2014-07-20T20:58:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah, but according to him it was mostly just acquaintance.
@time=2014-07-20T20:59:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And, well, it's not like I can ask Taniguchi for a second opinion."
@time=2014-07-20T21:03:11.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And not great with advice?  Do you think he'll endanger himself?"
@time=2014-07-20T21:04:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Let's say he's not exactly the patient type," Yurika says.
@time=2014-07-20T21:05:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Sometimes he has some trouble keeping his temper in check.
@time=2014-07-20T21:06:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You remember the 'three wishes' cult that sprang up a few months ago, right?"
@time=2014-07-20T21:06:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :s/three wishes/three souls/
@time=2014-07-20T21:07:51.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako turns to Hikari; partially for reassurance, partially to hide what's happening to her expression at least a little bit from Yurika.
@time=2014-07-20T21:08:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :This just isn't Ayako's day.

@time=2014-07-20T21:09:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki probably has some background knowledge of the case as well, if he wants to chip in.

@time=2014-07-20T21:10:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki is busy stewing about his friend getting to be a prophet despite his anger issues.
