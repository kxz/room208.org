[26-Jul-2014 20:12:30]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Disco 2000 with Aoi Iwatani
[26-Jul-2014 20:13:16]  <IllFlower> So last we left off, Kazuki was busy being comatose.
[26-Jul-2014 20:13:22]  <IllFlower> Oh, and something about a barrier.
[26-Jul-2014 20:13:58]  <Alicia> Well, Hikari brought it up to Ayako, but she was all "Eh, later, now's not the time." :p
[26-Jul-2014 20:14:12]  <Alicia> Which, is true...
[26-Jul-2014 20:14:52]  <ponicalica> Ayako marked down where it was on a train map so that we could go back to it.  P
[26-Jul-2014 20:14:55]  <ponicalica> :p
[26-Jul-2014 20:14:59]  <IllFlower> You guys are good at this "investigating" thing, aren't you.
[26-Jul-2014 20:15:11]  <Alicia> Welllllll.
[26-Jul-2014 20:15:25]  <IllFlower> In any case, "later" is now. So what say you?
[26-Jul-2014 20:16:44]  <Rig> So, another barrier blocking off a building?
[26-Jul-2014 20:16:51]  <Rig> We’ve had good luck with those, right?
[26-Jul-2014 20:17:27]  <ponicalica> Mai's went alright.
[26-Jul-2014 20:17:29]  <Alicia> Right, we already met up with Mai and got some information from her. So we could go back and try our luck there.
[26-Jul-2014 20:18:03]  <Alicia> Or there's the whole guard thing.
[26-Jul-2014 20:18:44]  <IllFlower> You probably won't die.
[26-Jul-2014 20:18:54]  <IllFlower> In case that helps you make your decision.
[26-Jul-2014 20:20:09]  <BGTB2005> I vote for investigating the barrier
[26-Jul-2014 20:20:12]  <Rig> Me too.
[26-Jul-2014 20:20:25]  <Alicia> I've wanted to.
[26-Jul-2014 20:20:45]  <IllFlower> For so long!
[26-Jul-2014 20:20:57]  <ponicalica> what do you think she's so hyped for, IllFlower?
[26-Jul-2014 20:21:20]  <Alicia> Let's go!
[26-Jul-2014 20:22:07]  <IllFlower> It's bright and early in the morning when the Conservators set back out for Miyahama and the building where they saw the barrier the previous day.
[26-Jul-2014 20:23:53]  <IllFlower> Finding it again proves surprisingly easy. The sunlight reflects off the visible surfaces of the magical wall, causing them to stand out even from behind the place's shuttered windows.
[26-Jul-2014 20:24:34]  <Rig> “It brightens the place up,” Kazuki comments.
[26-Jul-2014 20:25:59]  <IllFlower> The lot itself is blocked off at ground level by fences and construction equipment. A large sign informs passers-by that the building is scheduled for demolition. The concrete exterior seems appropriately aged and gritty.
[26-Jul-2014 20:26:22]  <ponicalica> man, initiates really like using abandoned buildings
[26-Jul-2014 20:26:38]  <Alicia> I'd use one as my hideout.
[26-Jul-2014 20:26:48]  <Alicia> They've got good taste.
[26-Jul-2014 20:26:50]  <Rig> Is the barrier up against the building?
[26-Jul-2014 20:26:57]  <Rig> Or does it extend to the fence?
[26-Jul-2014 20:27:07]  <ponicalica> From how it was described last week, I assumed that the barrier was inside the building, but I could be wrong
[26-Jul-2014 20:27:29]  <IllFlower> The barrier seems to cover just one part of a floor of the building. Probably an apartment.
[26-Jul-2014 20:28:43]  <Alicia> Makes them easy to find.
[26-Jul-2014 20:28:53]  <Rig> “Should we go ring the bell?”
[26-Jul-2014 20:29:00]  <IllFlower> True to form, there don't appear to be any workers on site today. The demolition seems to have been delayed for some bureaucratic reason or another.
[26-Jul-2014 20:30:39]  <IllFlower> Rig: Kazuki jokes, but he finds the doorbells have all been stripped already.
[26-Jul-2014 20:30:52]  <Rig> Effecient.
[26-Jul-2014 20:31:16]  <Rig> Kazuki eyes the removed doorbells. “I don’t have much hope for the elevators either."
[26-Jul-2014 20:31:26]  <ponicalica> "Too bad only one of us can fly."
[26-Jul-2014 20:31:32]  <BGTB2005> Rin considers just flying up to the barrier
[26-Jul-2014 20:32:21]  <Rig> “You can fly?” Kazuki asks Ayako. “Maybe you should scout ahead?”
[26-Jul-2014 20:32:31]  <BGTB2005> "I can."
[26-Jul-2014 20:32:32]  <IllFlower> The elevator doesn't work, but it looks like there's a scissor lift outside that the construction crew's left behind.
[26-Jul-2014 20:32:50]  <ponicalica> "I'm not sure I'd trust Rin to scout ahead."
[26-Jul-2014 20:33:36]  <IllFlower> And there's always the stairs. Seven floors up isn't *that* high, right?
[26-Jul-2014 20:34:16]  <Rig> “How about we split up? Ayako and Rin will take the outside of the building and Hikari and I will take the stairs?”
[26-Jul-2014 20:34:26]  <IllFlower> Well, Kazuki might get a little winded. He's only got 3 Bd.
[26-Jul-2014 20:34:30]  <Alicia> "Sure, I'm fine with that."
[26-Jul-2014 20:34:43]  <ponicalica> whereas the rest of us have a whopping 4 Bd
[26-Jul-2014 20:35:04]  <Rig> “We’ll text you when we’re in position,” Kazuki says and heads for the stairs.
[26-Jul-2014 20:35:06]  <BGTB2005> 7 Wl :p
[26-Jul-2014 20:35:18]  <Alicia> And 5 Will.
[26-Jul-2014 20:35:38]  <Alicia> "Just don't do anything rash, Rin.
[26-Jul-2014 20:35:39]  <Alicia> "

[26-Jul-2014 20:36:15]  <Rig> Kazuki whispers to Hikari as they climb the stairs, “Did Rin do something before?”
[26-Jul-2014 20:36:20]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.72.53.80> has joined #madokamadness
[26-Jul-2014 20:36:26]  <BGTB2005> "Sure," Rin responds as she summons her wings
[26-Jul-2014 20:36:42]  <ponicalica> "I'll try to make sure Rin doesn't do anything rash.  Follow me, Rin; the lift is this way."
[26-Jul-2014 20:37:45]  <IllFlower> Up on the seventh floor, the barrier resembles nothing so much as a wall of tightly woven reflective fabric. The door and all of the windows are blocked by the same pattern.
[26-Jul-2014 20:38:18]  <Alicia> "Rin works best... when she has someone to keep her in line. We still have trouble with that." Hikari mulls over what to say, before continuing. "On our last assignment she attacked someone without good cause."
[26-Jul-2014 20:38:51]  <IllFlower> All of the other rooms are devoid of people, and some even of interior walls and fixtures. Of course. The place's being demolished, after all.
[26-Jul-2014 20:39:30]  <Rig> Kazuki nods, but keeps his worries to himself. They’ve reached the barrier. The woven magic feels strangely intense to him. He’s never seen initiates use something so complex.
[26-Jul-2014 20:40:17]  <Rig> He sends a quick text to Ayako, “No way in on this side"
[26-Jul-2014 20:41:20]  <ponicalica> Ayako responds "Same here, but I think Rin's considering just setting the whole barrier on fire"
[26-Jul-2014 20:42:05]  <Rig> “No” is Kazuki’s response to that particular idea
[26-Jul-2014 20:42:17]  <IllFlower> Hahaha.
[26-Jul-2014 20:42:31]  <Alicia> To the point.
[26-Jul-2014 20:43:11]  <ponicalica> ("The whole barrier?  I was considering setting the whole building on fire!")
[26-Jul-2014 20:43:28]  <IllFlower> Well, someone's gotta do something!
[26-Jul-2014 20:44:05]  <Rig> Kazuki reaches out with his senses and tries to sense magic inside the barrier, but the whole thing seems to radiate too much energy to see through.
[26-Jul-2014 20:44:15]  <Rig> “Ideas?” he texts
[26-Jul-2014 20:44:18]  <BGTB2005> "Set the barrier on fire? I was thinking of trying to blow a hole in it."
[26-Jul-2014 20:44:27]  <Rig> “ones that don’t involve fire” he appends quickly
[26-Jul-2014 20:44:47]  <IllFlower> You guys are adorable.
[26-Jul-2014 20:44:59]  <Rig> (“the building is already scheduled for demolition!”
[26-Jul-2014 20:45:00]  <Rig> )
[26-Jul-2014 20:45:23]  <IllFlower> Ayako basically lightsabered open the barrier last time.
[26-Jul-2014 20:45:36]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.72.53.80> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 202 seconds)
[26-Jul-2014 20:45:38]  <Rig> I wouldn’t be opposed to that again.
[26-Jul-2014 20:45:58]  <Alicia> "Ayako and you could try to feel out any weak points, perhaps? And then Rin forces us through."
[26-Jul-2014 20:46:14]  <Alicia> (Imagining us all in the same text group.)
[26-Jul-2014 20:46:41]  <BGTB2005> Rin looks up to the roof of the building, mentally counting the number of floors
[26-Jul-2014 20:46:51]  <BGTB2005> yeah, that's what I was thinking too
[26-Jul-2014 20:46:57]  <ponicalica> "That might work, if Rin can avoid doing something that would take the whole neighborhood down with her."
[26-Jul-2014 20:47:03]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.72.53.80> has joined #madokamadness
[26-Jul-2014 20:47:15]  <Alicia> "... yes. Carefully, very carefully."
[26-Jul-2014 20:47:27]  <Rig> “Sounds good”
[26-Jul-2014 20:47:40]  <BGTB2005> "Thought about dropping the building on the barrier. But lead the way."
[26-Jul-2014 20:48:25]  <Rig> Kazuki reaches out again, physically this time, and runs his hands around the barrier just inches from the surface. He uses slight pulses of magic to probe for weaknesses.
[26-Jul-2014 20:49:06]  <ponicalica> Ayako pulls out her notebook and begins chanting something, pushing her own pulses of magic at the barrier, and probably creating some sort of neat resonance pattern.
[26-Jul-2014 20:49:18]  <IllFlower> About halfway up the door, Kazuki runs his fingers against something that feels like a seam.
[26-Jul-2014 20:49:37]  <IllFlower> It begins to glow brightly as Ayako finishes her chant.
[26-Jul-2014 20:50:10]  <IllFlower> The gold light stands in stark contrast to the black fabric.
[26-Jul-2014 20:50:14]  <Rig> “got something over here,” he texts.
[26-Jul-2014 20:54:59]  <ponicalica> "can one of you two blow it open or should I send Rin over?"
[26-Jul-2014 20:55:27]  <IllFlower> You have my go-ahead to do something cool.

[26-Jul-2014 20:55:42]  <Alicia> "I think we should leave that up to Rin."

[26-Jul-2014 20:58:12]  <ponicalica> remember: done is better than good
[26-Jul-2014 20:59:26]  <BGTB2005> Rin texts back, "I'll be there soon."
[26-Jul-2014 21:00:02]  <Alicia> (Her fingers shaking, happy to blow stuff up.)
[26-Jul-2014 21:00:21]  <BGTB2005> yeah pretty much
[26-Jul-2014 21:00:28]  <Rig> Hahaha, “Burn It Down” just started playing on Spotify.
[26-Jul-2014 21:00:46]  <Alicia> Hahah.
[26-Jul-2014 21:00:57]  <BGTB2005> haha
[26-Jul-2014 21:00:58]  <IllFlower> THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DEGREES
[26-Jul-2014 21:02:18]  <BGTB2005> Regrouping with Hikari and Kazuki, Rin summons her cannon
[26-Jul-2014 21:02:33]  <Alicia> "I recommend you stand back, Kazuki."
[26-Jul-2014 21:02:36]  <BGTB2005> "Where do I need to point this at?"
[26-Jul-2014 21:02:46]  <Rig> Kazuki steps back and points at the glowing seam.
[26-Jul-2014 21:02:52]  *** Section42L <~Section@CPE18593345ef4c-CM18593345ef49.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[26-Jul-2014 21:02:52]  <IllFlower> Makoto sues for patent infringement.
[26-Jul-2014 21:03:15]  <Rig> “Be careful, please."
[26-Jul-2014 21:03:31]  <Rig> (
[26-Jul-2014 21:03:38]  <Rig> (“I don’t know the meaning of the word”)
[26-Jul-2014 21:04:01]  <BGTB2005> "You should be fine if you stay behind me."
[26-Jul-2014 21:06:17]  <ponicalica> ("Unless I accidentally bring the whole building down, of course, in which case we're fucked.")
[26-Jul-2014 21:09:15]  <IllFlower> ("Sorry, the cannon takes a while to get ready. Gotta clean the barrel, pack some gunpowder into the back, put the shot down in front, light the fuse...")
[26-Jul-2014 21:09:23]  <BGTB2005> Taking aim at the seam, Rin launches what can only be described as a solid ball of fire from the cannon
[26-Jul-2014 21:10:31]  <IllFlower> The ball smashes straight into the join in the barrier, which begins to shine a searing white-hot.
[26-Jul-2014 21:10:59]  <IllFlower> A loud snap echoes down the central stairwell, then another, then another.
[26-Jul-2014 21:12:18]  <IllFlower> The two halves of the barrier fall to pieces as the fire chews through the division between them, eventually drifting harmlessly to the floor to reveal the original white front door.
[26-Jul-2014 21:13:11]  <Rig> Kazuki blinks the stars from his eyes and looks at the oddly pristine door. “Do you think we still need to knock?"
[26-Jul-2014 21:13:37]  <ponicalica> Does Ayako see anything through the window?
[26-Jul-2014 21:14:03]  <IllFlower> I thought she was with the others.
[26-Jul-2014 21:14:10]  <IllFlower> Did Rin just leave her behind on the lift?
[26-Jul-2014 21:14:15]  <BGTB2005> Rin left her outside
[26-Jul-2014 21:14:17]  <IllFlower> Tsk.
[26-Jul-2014 21:14:27]  <IllFlower> No, the window's still blocked off.
[26-Jul-2014 21:14:46]  <Alicia> "Well, a little cordiality couldn't hurt." Hikari responds, gently tapping on the door, though no response comes.
[26-Jul-2014 21:15:15]  <BGTB2005> (And here Rin's idea of knocking was to kick the door in)
[26-Jul-2014 21:16:10]  <IllFlower> Of course there's no answer.
[26-Jul-2014 21:16:12]  <ponicalica> Ayako sends a text to the others.  "is it working?"
[26-Jul-2014 21:16:32]  <Rig> Kazuki fires a quick text “we’re through”
[26-Jul-2014 21:17:15]  <Rig> He reaches out again trying to sense a presence through the door.
[26-Jul-2014 21:17:29]  <IllFlower> Nothing.
[26-Jul-2014 21:17:34]  <ponicalica> Seeing that the barrier has yet to fall on Ayako's side, she lowers the lift and begins to run up the stairs, presumably to arrive when most narratively convenient.
[26-Jul-2014 21:17:59]  <Rig> Kazuki tries the handle.
[26-Jul-2014 21:18:28]  <IllFlower> To Kazuki's surprise, the door is unlocked.
[26-Jul-2014 21:18:49]  <Rig> “Shall we?” he says with a smile back at the group as he opens the door.
[26-Jul-2014 21:19:04]  <BGTB2005> (Here I was thinking Rin entered directly from the lift, and I even thought about typing it out, but I guess it could be explained by her wings)
[26-Jul-2014 21:19:22]  <ponicalica> I assumed that Rin used her wings and broke open a nearby window.
[26-Jul-2014 21:19:48]  <Alicia> Hikari smiles back. "Let's."
[26-Jul-2014 21:19:50]  <IllFlower> The hallway's still outside. Just seven floors up.
[26-Jul-2014 21:20:12]  <BGTB2005> I was thinking the lift had a nearby platform for access, but your assumption works
[26-Jul-2014 21:20:20]  <Rig> Ah, see, I pictured something different.
[26-Jul-2014 21:20:43]  <Rig> Anyway, shall we describe the inside of this love nest?
[26-Jul-2014 21:20:58]  <IllFlower> The room inside has been stripped to its bare concrete shell, just like all the others.
[26-Jul-2014 21:21:45]  <IllFlower> This place, however, is definitely occupied.
[26-Jul-2014 21:23:23]  <IllFlower> In the dim light coming in through the hallway -- the windows are still blocked off -- Kazuki sees the floor is littered with food containers and empty bottles.
[26-Jul-2014 21:24:15]  <IllFlower> There are two pieces of furniture: a threadbare mattress lying squat in the center of the room, and, bizarrely enough, a lectern off to the side.
[26-Jul-2014 21:24:28]  <ponicalica> @w lectern >! >_> <_<

[26-Jul-2014 21:25:41]  <IllFlower> A girl about Hikari's age, wearing nothing more than what appears to be a tattered shirt, lies on the mattress, unconscious and apparently in some discomfort.
[26-Jul-2014 21:25:47]  <IllFlower> Ayako's not there yet, right?
[26-Jul-2014 21:26:09]  <ponicalica> She's up there if it makes more sense for what you're planning :p
[26-Jul-2014 21:26:11]  <IllFlower> She appears to have the same wounds that Megumi and Mai had, except worse.

[26-Jul-2014 21:26:54]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Not yet. Let's give the others a little time to react.
[26-Jul-2014 21:26:58]  <Alicia> Hikari notices the girl. "... Kazuki, do you mind sensing what's gong on in here, please?" She motions towards the girl on the mattress.
[26-Jul-2014 21:27:24]  <ponicalica> Hikari's knowledege of bondage should really help with these cases.
[26-Jul-2014 21:27:56]  <Alicia> You don't just share that information freely, ponical.
[26-Jul-2014 21:29:43]  <Rig> Kazuki approaches the girl cautiously.
[26-Jul-2014 21:30:19]  <Rig> He kneels down beside the mattress and holds one hand over the girl, letting his magical senses reach out and search for lasting effects.
[26-Jul-2014 21:32:00]  <IllFlower> Kazuki notices that the burn marks aren't the only things visibly wrong here. The girl is frighteningly thin, as if she hasn't eaten properly in some time, and there are various cuts and bruises in seemingly random places.
[26-Jul-2014 21:32:25]  <IllFlower> Her skin is incredibly pale. She hasn't seen the sun in some time.
[26-Jul-2014 21:32:51]  <Rig> “It looks like someone trapped this girl here.”
[26-Jul-2014 21:32:54]  <IllFlower> Her breathing is shallow and pained.
[26-Jul-2014 21:33:04]  <Rig> “Witches don’t do this,” he mutters to himself.
[26-Jul-2014 21:33:16]  <IllFlower> He's right. They don't.
[26-Jul-2014 21:33:21]  <Alicia> "We should get her out of here quickly."
[26-Jul-2014 21:33:27]  <IllFlower> Okay, Ayako can make her debut any time now.
[26-Jul-2014 21:34:07]  <Rig> And now we reveal that this is Kotomi.
[26-Jul-2014 21:34:20]  <IllFlower> You caught on?
[26-Jul-2014 21:34:24]  <Rig> Yep.
[26-Jul-2014 21:34:27]  <IllFlower> Good work.
[26-Jul-2014 21:35:04]  <ponicalica> Ayako finally makes her way up the stairs; once she reaches the now-exposed room, and eyes the mattress, she lets out an audible gasp.
[26-Jul-2014 21:35:46]  <Rig> Kazuki turns quickly to see what Ayako’s looking at only to find that it’s the girl. “You know her?”
[26-Jul-2014 21:37:29]  <ponicalica> Ayako's emotions are a complex stew.  "I...she...that...that's Kotomi."  Ayako falls to the ground, leaning against the door's frame.
[26-Jul-2014 21:37:40]  <ponicalica> (arc 4: Ayako overuses ellipses)
[26-Jul-2014 21:38:28]  <Alicia> "Ayako!" Hikari rushes over to support her.
[26-Jul-2014 21:38:48]  <IllFlower> The yuri shippers squeal.
[26-Jul-2014 21:38:57]  <Rig> “Kotomi? The cult leader?!” Kazuki stands up and looks down at the girl in a mix of disgust and sympathy.
[26-Jul-2014 21:38:59]  <Alicia> (Pfft.)
[26-Jul-2014 21:39:09]  <IllFlower> I should just have a yuri-goggles meter on the screen at all times.

[26-Jul-2014 21:39:22]  <IllFlower> Like those things CNN put up during debates.
[26-Jul-2014 21:39:29]  <Rig> Omnipresence can detect it and reports live to a twitter.
[26-Jul-2014 21:39:35]  *** JBridge <~JBridge@c-67-160-212-188.hsd1.ca.comcast.net> has joined #madokamadness
[26-Jul-2014 21:40:09]  <IllFlower> Anyway, uh, let's keep going.
[26-Jul-2014 21:41:24]  <Rig> “We should take her… somewhere,” Kazuki says, continuing the use of ellipses.
[26-Jul-2014 21:42:10]  <Alicia> (Brb real quick parents0
[26-Jul-2014 21:42:11]  <Alicia> )*
[26-Jul-2014 21:43:30]  <Alicia> (K back.)
[26-Jul-2014 21:44:47]  <IllFlower> ("But where... would be best?" "I have no... idea." "Can't... you see... how bad... this is?")
[26-Jul-2014 21:44:52]  <Rig> Okay, I think we need to work somethingout really quick.
[26-Jul-2014 21:45:24]  <Rig> Like, do the conservators normally just execute cult leaders in the name of [strike]the moon[/strike]justice?
[26-Jul-2014 21:45:32]  <IllFlower> Nope.
[26-Jul-2014 21:45:40]  <Rig> Good, then there is some kind of prison?
[26-Jul-2014 21:45:51]  <BGTB2005> why wouldn't there be
[26-Jul-2014 21:46:03]  <Rig> I dunno. Dogs can just kill people normally.
[26-Jul-2014 21:46:13]  <Rig> And it’d be a justified thing to do to a cult leader.
[26-Jul-2014 21:46:23]  <Alicia> We need her for questioning.
[26-Jul-2014 21:46:59]  <Alicia> Or, well, in general she could still be of use. Under proper containment and such.
[26-Jul-2014 21:47:04]  <IllFlower> I mean, you *could* kill her. There wouldn't be too many questions.
[26-Jul-2014 21:47:24]  <IllFlower> Whether or not it's wise to do so is another issue entirely.
[26-Jul-2014 21:47:26]  <ponicalica> ("I feel like I need to get revenge for something.")
[26-Jul-2014 21:47:53]  <Rig> Kazuki looks between Ayako and Kotomi. “Look, let’s do it this way. I’ll take her, Kotomi, to the Conservator’s Hall. Ayako should contact Shii and set up a meeting. This isn’t right.”
[26-Jul-2014 21:48:10]  <IllFlower> You could summon Shii. Familiars are very mobile that way.
[26-Jul-2014 21:48:25]  <Rig> But do we really want to stay here?
[26-Jul-2014 21:48:37]  <IllFlower> You have a point.
[26-Jul-2014 21:48:39]  <Alicia> I see no reason to.
[26-Jul-2014 21:48:52]  <Rig> And Ayako needs a moment, I think.
[26-Jul-2014 21:49:01]  <Rig> Plus Kazuki can move Kotomi while masking their presence.
[26-Jul-2014 21:50:04]  <IllFlower> Okay, then let's get a move on.
[26-Jul-2014 21:50:29]  <ponicalica> Ayako, through tears, grabs Hikari's hand to pull herself back up.  "Okay, I can do that."
[26-Jul-2014 21:51:15]  <Rig> Kazuki claps his hands together and transforms in a flash of light. Before the girls can get a good look at him, both he and Kotomi are gone. The girls are left with only a brief image of a cat’s tail slipping through the door.
[26-Jul-2014 21:51:26]  <IllFlower> lol.
[26-Jul-2014 21:51:30]  <BGTB2005> pffff
[26-Jul-2014 21:51:39]  <BGTB2005> ("Kitty?")
[26-Jul-2014 21:51:51]  <Rig> The whole costume is gonna be quite a thing when we get to that point. ^_^
[26-Jul-2014 21:51:54]  <Alicia> "He's so flashy. I really don't understand why." Hikari mutters, before turning back to Ayako and Rin.
[26-Jul-2014 21:52:00]  <ponicalica> pffff
[26-Jul-2014 21:52:05]  <ponicalica> hikari complaining about flashiness
[26-Jul-2014 21:52:29]  <Alicia> "I think we should go. Rin, Ayako?"
[26-Jul-2014 21:52:44]  <Alicia> (ponicalica: Hehehe.)

[26-Jul-2014 21:54:35]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's made it down to the ground floor of the building when he hears the sound of harried crunching on the gravel nearby. Someone's clearly there.
[26-Jul-2014 21:55:01]  <Alicia> "Although..." Quickly, Hikari checks around the lectern for anything important, before continuing off with the rest.
[26-Jul-2014 21:55:39]  <Rig> Kazuki supresses the combined presence of himself and Kotomi as best he can as he presses himself against the wall. The battered body of Kotomi is heavy in his arms.
[26-Jul-2014 21:55:50]  <IllFlower> Alicia: The lectern is empty.
[26-Jul-2014 21:56:00]  <Alicia> So we're utterly done here.
[26-Jul-2014 21:56:36]  <IllFlower> Rig: There's absolutely no sound for a long while.
[26-Jul-2014 21:56:53]  <IllFlower> Whoever it is clearly doesn't want to be found out.
[26-Jul-2014 21:57:23]  <Rig> Kazuki makes a run for it, leaping over the fence in one bound. He can’t bother fighting when he’s got an injured suspect on his hands.
[26-Jul-2014 21:57:58]  <IllFlower> He checks back as he flees down the street, but sees nobody there.
[26-Jul-2014 21:58:35]  <IllFlower> It looks like they weren't after him.
[26-Jul-2014 21:59:24]  <IllFlower> By the time the girls make it down, there's no sign that anything's amiss.
[26-Jul-2014 22:00:20]  <IllFlower> Is Kazuki just going to lug Kotomi all the way back? Hope he at least calls a taxi or something.
[26-Jul-2014 22:00:55]  <Alicia> He's always liked the idea of rescuing girls. But not like this.
[26-Jul-2014 22:01:23]  <ponicalica> The taxi driver sees a catboy carrying an unconscious body; thanks to the SEP, he doesn't comment.
[26-Jul-2014 22:01:40]  <IllFlower> Either way, I don't really have anything else to do here, so we can move on to everyone meeting up again back in the Conservators' lair or whatever you guys want.
[26-Jul-2014 22:02:16]  <Alicia> Fine by me.
[26-Jul-2014 22:02:16]  <Rig> The lair sounds good.
[26-Jul-2014 22:02:33]  <ponicalica> The lair sounds good, though at some point we should probably get back to Kinomoto, heh
[26-Jul-2014 22:03:11]  <BGTB2005> I guess lair first, to talk with Shii or whoever, then meet with Kinomoto
[26-Jul-2014 22:03:19]  <Alicia> Mhm.
[26-Jul-2014 22:03:25]  <IllFlower> I don't have any new insights to deliver, so one of you can start the conversation.
[26-Jul-2014 22:03:32]  <Rig> brb
[26-Jul-2014 22:03:44]  <IllFlower> I figure this is more of a chance for you guys to try and make sense of what's happening than anything else.
[26-Jul-2014 22:04:08]  <IllFlower> Then we can move on from there.
[26-Jul-2014 22:04:49]  <ponicalica> ("i know you've mentioned being a master at ropes, hikari, so do you have any thoughts on that?")
[26-Jul-2014 22:06:16]  <Alicia> (Pfffft.)
[26-Jul-2014 22:06:21]  <Rig> Back.
[26-Jul-2014 22:07:06]  <Rig> Kazuki joins the girls in the main room of the Conservator’s Hall. “She’s being looked at by medics in the holding cells,” he says as he joins the group.
[26-Jul-2014 22:07:11]  <ponicalica> "That lectern there was a bit oddly placed.  It almost reminds me of before I became a Conservator, when Saki or Yurika would set up clandestine classrooms."
[26-Jul-2014 22:07:12]  <IllFlower> Rig: I should mention, the effective death penalty in this setting is depowerment and excommunication. Actually killing people is generally something that's only done when there's imminent danger. Well, in theory, at least.
[26-Jul-2014 22:07:53]  <ponicalica> (watch as this turns out to be a complete red herring)
[26-Jul-2014 22:08:05]  <IllFlower> Magic is a dangerous and sometimes lethal enterprise.
[26-Jul-2014 22:08:32]  <Rig> “I don’t think anyone was interested in teaching her, Ayako. That looked like torture.”
[26-Jul-2014 22:09:34]  <ponicalica> "Of course not, but the resemblance was odd and jarring."
[26-Jul-2014 22:10:16]  <Rig> “So, we’re sent out here to chase rumors of Kotomi. We find her injured in the exact same way as her victims, locked inside a magical barrier.”
[26-Jul-2014 22:10:33]  <Rig> “And the only witch we’ve found was a trumped up rumor of Kotomi’s involvement?”
[26-Jul-2014 22:10:50]  <Rig> “We’re being lead around in circles.”
[26-Jul-2014 22:11:31]  <IllFlower> (Kazuki dramatically swipes all of the papers off of his desk in frustration.)
[26-Jul-2014 22:11:43]  <IllFlower> ("I DIDN'T JOIN THE NYPD SO I COULD GET JERKED AROUND")
[26-Jul-2014 22:11:47]  <Rig> hahaha
[26-Jul-2014 22:13:29]  <IllFlower> ("I WANT A FUCKING SUSPECT IN CUSTODY BY FIVE O'CLOCK TOMORROW AFTERNOON OR ONE OF YOU IS GETTING A FREE WEEKEND SLEEPAWAY AT RIKERS ISLAND DO YOU UNDERSTAND")
[26-Jul-2014 22:14:29]  <Rig> I could continue monologuing unless one of you is typing up something?
[26-Jul-2014 22:14:39]  <Rig> Or we could let IllFlower act out his cop drama.
[26-Jul-2014 22:15:05]  <Alicia> You can continue.
[26-Jul-2014 22:15:13]  <IllFlower> I already made the jokes about this being basically Madoka, the police procedural.
[26-Jul-2014 22:16:35]  <Rig> Kazuki taps his foot impatiently. “Kinomoto…” he mumbles.
[26-Jul-2014 22:17:01]  <ponicalica> "Do you think he could have done it?  Mai did have some involvement in the Okada-Fukuda case..."
[26-Jul-2014 22:17:38]  <Rig> “Yurika mentioned he had a vendetta, but she said he wouldn’t act so directly.”
[26-Jul-2014 22:17:53]  * BGTB2005 checks NPCs
[26-Jul-2014 22:18:06]  <Rig> “And he wouldn’t jeopardize a chance to become a prophet. No one would be that stupid.”
[26-Jul-2014 22:19:04]  <BGTB2005> "Okada-Fukuda case?"
[26-Jul-2014 22:19:26]  <ponicalica> er, osada
[26-Jul-2014 22:19:46]  <IllFlower> The second branch.
[26-Jul-2014 22:19:56]  <BGTB2005> (also did the whole thing with Emi ever get resolved?)
[26-Jul-2014 22:20:08]  <BGTB2005> Rin wasn't around for the second branch
[26-Jul-2014 22:21:04]  <IllFlower> Just to make sure we're all up to speed.
[26-Jul-2014 22:21:26]  <IllFlower> Satsuki Osada got taken down. Nothing really seems to have happened to Emi Fukuda.
[26-Jul-2014 22:22:42]  <Rig> “Oh, wait, I almost forgot!"
[26-Jul-2014 22:22:57]  <Rig> “There was someone else at the building when I was leaving. Did you see anyone?”
[26-Jul-2014 22:23:41]  <Alicia> "No, we didn't see anyone."
[26-Jul-2014 22:23:43]  <BGTB2005> "I didn't see anyone."
[26-Jul-2014 22:24:25]  <Rig> “Damn."
[26-Jul-2014 22:25:51]  <Rig> “Our only suspect seems to be Kinomoto, but I’m loathe to accuse a soon-to-be prophet of crimes.” Kazuki stares at the ground in frustration.
[26-Jul-2014 22:26:38]  <IllFlower> Is he really?
[26-Jul-2014 22:26:56]  <Rig> No, but Kazuki is stuck on him.
[26-Jul-2014 22:27:00]  <BGTB2005> seems to be
[26-Jul-2014 22:27:48]  <Rig> Yurika is a suspect for a few reasons, but Kazuki wouldn’t name her because she commands some kind of respect and isn’t a ‘rival’ of his.
[26-Jul-2014 22:28:41]  <Rig> And Emi could be part of this, but I’m not really certain.
[26-Jul-2014 22:30:29]  <Rig> So, what’s the route we want to take. Demand that we crash Yuuya’s ceremony? Act as security? Call up Shii and tell her about Kotomi?
[26-Jul-2014 22:30:42]  <BGTB2005> all of the above?
[26-Jul-2014 22:30:47]  <IllFlower> I assumed you guys already told Shii.
[26-Jul-2014 22:30:57]  <Rig> Okay, that’s good.
[26-Jul-2014 22:31:01]  <ponicalica> "But if he is involved, we could have a corrupt prophet, and that could be even more of a disaster..."
[26-Jul-2014 22:31:35]  <Alicia> Well, Kazuki's already a one man party crasher. Surely he could crash Yuuya's. :p
[26-Jul-2014 22:31:58]  <Rig> What party did he crash? Are you sure you don’t mean Rin?
[26-Jul-2014 22:32:23]  <IllFlower> A wedding party. He steals all the girls' hearts.
[26-Jul-2014 22:32:26]  <Alicia> We could also just act as security to let Kazuki worm his way in.
[26-Jul-2014 22:32:43]  <Alicia> Rig: I'm joking about how he's the best leader right now.
[26-Jul-2014 22:33:27]  <Rig> “Kotomi… did Yurika know Kotomi?” Kazuki is talking to the air now.
[26-Jul-2014 22:33:56]  <IllFlower> Good thing everyone's got photographic memory. ;)
[26-Jul-2014 22:34:00]  <Rig> I know.
[26-Jul-2014 22:34:11]  <Rig> Ayako was mentored by Yurika right?
[26-Jul-2014 22:34:27]  <ponicalica> by Saki, and then Yurika was a friend or something
[26-Jul-2014 22:34:42]  <ponicalica> probably the same familiar, etc.
[26-Jul-2014 22:35:26]  <IllFlower> Ayako always got the impression Yurika was looking down on her, something like that.
[26-Jul-2014 22:35:41]  <IllFlower> As far as I can recall, at least. Ayako felt like she had to prove herself.
[26-Jul-2014 22:36:10]  <Alicia> Just not able to catch a break.
[26-Jul-2014 22:36:23]  <ponicalica> Yeah, it was something like that.  Recently, I was imagining something like "Ayako completely botched her first mission as an emgirl with Yurika, and she went off on her, etc."
[26-Jul-2014 22:37:00]  <Rig> Do we have a list of all the NPCs or just the bad ones?
[26-Jul-2014 22:37:21]  <ponicalica> Just the ones IllFlower has had to stat up.
[26-Jul-2014 22:37:50]  <Rig> Right. I need to take notes or something to keep all these people straight.
[26-Jul-2014 22:38:00]  <IllFlower> I should make another list. Sorry.
[26-Jul-2014 22:38:47]  <Rig> Not a problem. Just having trouble maintaining it all in memory.
[26-Jul-2014 22:38:51]  <Alicia> I should take notes in general...
[26-Jul-2014 22:38:54]  <Rig> What’s our next step then?
[26-Jul-2014 22:39:21]  <IllFlower> There are like 30 named characters by this point. Which is why I'm mostly going back to old characters for this arc. >_>
[26-Jul-2014 22:39:59]  <IllFlower> Although I think fewer than 10 of them are actually important.
[26-Jul-2014 22:40:04]  <Rig> Yeah.
[26-Jul-2014 22:40:57]  <Alicia> "Ayako's right, Kinomoto is worth keeping an eye on. Which, we were going to do anyway..."
[26-Jul-2014 22:42:09]  <IllFlower> Are you guys just going to storm his next ritual, then?
[26-Jul-2014 22:42:17]  <Rig> I don’t think so.
[26-Jul-2014 22:42:27]  <Rig> One more question:
[26-Jul-2014 22:42:32]  <Rig> Is Kotomi connected to Emi?
[26-Jul-2014 22:42:39]  <BGTB2005> become his security detail, engineer an emergency that demands his evacuation?
[26-Jul-2014 22:42:49]  <IllFlower> No. Other than that their names end the same way.
[26-Jul-2014 22:42:54]  <Rig> Ah
[26-Jul-2014 22:43:09]  <IllFlower> I really gotta work on finding some names that don't sound like each other.
[26-Jul-2014 22:43:10]  <Rig> Let’s do it this way, we take security posts.
[26-Jul-2014 22:43:30]  <IllFlower> Security posts?
[26-Jul-2014 22:43:44]  <Rig> Well, like, we talked about acting as security with Yurika, right?
[26-Jul-2014 22:43:49]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[26-Jul-2014 22:43:55]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Well, there's only so many syllables you can use, I guess
[26-Jul-2014 22:44:21]  <Rig> And we still need to talk to Masakichi.
[26-Jul-2014 22:44:36]  <IllFlower> What about?
[26-Jul-2014 22:44:49]  <Rig> Let’s set up a meeting with Masakichi and Yuuya about being security for him.
[26-Jul-2014 22:44:55]  <Rig> Since Yurika suggested doing that.
[26-Jul-2014 22:45:29]  <Alicia> Let Kazuki work his charms on his old friend.
[26-Jul-2014 22:45:44]  <IllFlower> Sure, let's do that.
[26-Jul-2014 22:45:44]  <ponicalica> Is the idea that you suspect he'll try to break free?
[26-Jul-2014 22:46:02]  <Rig> Nah, more that I want to see how he responds to certain pressures.
[26-Jul-2014 22:46:19]  <Rig> And we can probably get a talking conflict out of it if we’re lucky!
[26-Jul-2014 22:46:28]  <Rig> been a while since we’ve done that, I think.
[26-Jul-2014 22:46:37]  <Alicia> Yay talking conflicts.
[26-Jul-2014 22:47:10]  <IllFlower> Kazuki sets up a meeting between the Conservators, Yuuya, and Masakichi in a park in Miyahama.
[26-Jul-2014 22:47:51]  <ponicalica> Imagining all the Conservators together is pretty amusing, especially since I imagine that Kazuki is really well-dressed and Rin is...not.
[26-Jul-2014 22:48:00]  <IllFlower> He suggests an out-of-the way location where they won't be noticed in case there's a shouting match. Or something beyond that, perhaps.
[26-Jul-2014 22:48:06]  <Alicia> ponicalica: And Hikari.
[26-Jul-2014 22:48:16]  <IllFlower> I thought Hikari was a sharp girl.
[26-Jul-2014 22:48:33]  <Alicia> I meant also well-dressed.
[26-Jul-2014 22:49:38]  <IllFlower> The park has a nice view of the rest of the city. A few hundred feet away, a handful of young boys are in the middle of a pick-up soccer game.
[26-Jul-2014 22:50:19]  <IllFlower> "Yo." Yuuya gives the Conservators a casual greeting as he and Masakichi arrive.
[26-Jul-2014 22:50:38]  <Rig> “Hey,” Kazuki says with a nod.
[26-Jul-2014 22:50:55]  <Rig> “Thanks for meeting us."
[26-Jul-2014 22:51:35]  <IllFlower> "Of course," Yuuya says. Masakichi, as usual, seems to be letting his initiate take the lead.
[26-Jul-2014 22:52:01]  <IllFlower> "I heard you guys captured Kotomi."
[26-Jul-2014 22:52:19]  <Rig> “Not so much, actually.”
[26-Jul-2014 22:52:29]  <IllFlower> "What do you mean?"
[26-Jul-2014 22:52:38]  <Alicia> "We found her unconscious and beaten up, alone in an apartment."
[26-Jul-2014 22:52:47]  <Rig> “Someone else did the capturing for us.”
[26-Jul-2014 22:53:00]  <ponicalica> "I wanted her brought to justice as much as anyone, but not quite like this."

[26-Jul-2014 22:55:28]  <Rig> “I think it’s safe to say she wasn’t the one after you, Kinomoto,” Kazuki says.
[26-Jul-2014 22:55:53]  <Rig> “But that only means something else is causing the attacks around you.”
[26-Jul-2014 22:56:23]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Sounds like innuendo to me!

[26-Jul-2014 22:56:37]  <Rig> “We’ve spoken to Yurika and she agreed to let us act as extra security during your rituals, but she advised us to talk to you about it first.” Kazuki smiles, “You don’t mind if we keep an eye on you, right?”

[26-Jul-2014 22:57:36]  <IllFlower> Rig: "N-No, of course not."
[26-Jul-2014 22:57:44]  <IllFlower> Yuuya pauses for a second.
[26-Jul-2014 22:58:00]  <IllFlower> "Sorry, I'm just trying to process what you told me.
[26-Jul-2014 22:58:19]  <IllFlower> "Did Kotomi say anything about what happened to her?"
[26-Jul-2014 22:58:44]  <Rig> “It’s okay. It came as a shock to us as well.” Kazuki shakes his head, “No, she wasn’t awake when we last saw her.”
[26-Jul-2014 22:59:17]  <Rig> “I thought you hadn’t been that close to her,” Kazuki says. “Why the concern?”
[26-Jul-2014 22:59:37]  <IllFlower> "You mean she's like Megumi."
[26-Jul-2014 22:59:55]  <Rig> Kazuki nods.
[26-Jul-2014 23:00:25]  <IllFlower> "I just figured that she might have something to say about who did this to her.
[26-Jul-2014 23:00:53]  <IllFlower> "It'd certainly take a load off my mind if I had a name and a face to watch out for."
[26-Jul-2014 23:01:56]  <Rig> “I think that would help everyone."
[26-Jul-2014 23:02:27]  <Rig> “Do you have any idea who would want both Megumi and Kotomi out of the way?”
[26-Jul-2014 23:02:53]  <Rig> (Someone who hates people who have i’s at the end of their names. Mai, Kazuki, and Hikari should be alert.)
[26-Jul-2014 23:03:11]  <IllFlower> The witch already hit Mai, even.
[26-Jul-2014 23:03:14]  <ponicalica> Maybe they just hate the "mi" kana
[26-Jul-2014 23:03:26]  <IllFlower> "I have no idea what the two of them even have in common, really."
[26-Jul-2014 23:03:43]  <Rig> “I know something they have in common,”
[26-Jul-2014 23:04:27]  <Rig> “But it’s a stretch.”
[26-Jul-2014 23:04:42]  <IllFlower> Yuuya looks up at Kazuki. "And what is that?"
[26-Jul-2014 23:05:02]  <Alicia> (>Hikari should be alert > D:) )
[26-Jul-2014 23:05:05]  <Alicia> D:)*

[26-Jul-2014 23:05:22]  <IllFlower> Alicia: What is that, a :) with a funny hat?
[26-Jul-2014 23:05:46]  <Alicia> Pffft. It looks like one.
[26-Jul-2014 23:06:19]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yuuya is silent. He fixes his eyes on the grass at his feet.
[26-Jul-2014 23:06:50]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Or a D: with a funny hat
[26-Jul-2014 23:07:07]  <IllFlower> One of those mime hats.
[26-Jul-2014 23:07:09]  <Rig> Kazuki steps closer to Yuuya. “Do you know what’s happening, Yuuya?”
[26-Jul-2014 23:07:11]  <Alicia> It's a small sun hat or something.
[26-Jul-2014 23:07:26]  <Rig> I thought it was D: with concerned eyebrows.
[26-Jul-2014 23:07:43]  <Alicia> (While all of this is going on, I imagine Rin is trying her best not to accidentally cause a tiny fire.)
[26-Jul-2014 23:07:54]  <IllFlower> Rig: "You said whoever it is was targeting me, right? So..."

[26-Jul-2014 23:15:04]  <Rig> I wasn’t certain if IllFlower had more to add.
[26-Jul-2014 23:15:18]  <ponicalica> I assume this is going to build towards one, but I think Rig has a clearer idea of what that is.
[26-Jul-2014 23:15:23]  <IllFlower> No. Yuuya just trails off.
[26-Jul-2014 23:16:14]  <Rig> Hm, well, I don’t think Kazuki can push in a way that makes sense to his character. Rin could jump in a press if BGTB2005 wants, but I think otherwise I’ll wrap it up.
[26-Jul-2014 23:16:56]  <Rig> Kazuki steps back from Yuuya. “I promise that we’ll keep an eye out for you, Kinomoto.” 
[26-Jul-2014 23:17:11]  <Rig> “We’ll see you at the ceremony.” (But you won’t see us)

[26-Jul-2014 23:17:52]  <IllFlower> Actually, you know what we're missing? An airheaded but somehow brilliant Conservator.
[26-Jul-2014 23:17:57]  <Rig> hahaha
[26-Jul-2014 23:18:02]  <Rig> Then we’d have the full cast.

[26-Jul-2014 23:19:38]  <IllFlower> "Right," Yuuya says, his voice abnormally subdued. "You stay safe too."

[26-Jul-2014 23:24:04]  <Rig> Nah, sorry. I didn’t think it would be natural at all.
[26-Jul-2014 23:24:23]  <Rig> The responses from Yuuya just didn’t work out in a way that I thought would make sense.
[26-Jul-2014 23:24:45]  <Rig> So, security detail or something else if anyone has ideas?
[26-Jul-2014 23:24:52]  <IllFlower> Should I have said "FUCK YOU YOU'RE NEVER FINDING THE TRUTH BWAHAHAHAHA" instead?
[26-Jul-2014 23:25:21]  <BGTB2005> Act as 'security detail', sneak our way in somehow to observe?
[26-Jul-2014 23:25:24]  <IllFlower> Had Yuuya flip the Conservators two birds?
[26-Jul-2014 23:25:37]  <Rig> Nah, it just didn’t really make sense for Kazuki to push his friend when the best evidence they had was “Someone told us that you have a grudge!"
[26-Jul-2014 23:26:04]  <Rig> And there wasn’t a good enough reason to be like “Did you torture Kotomi”
[26-Jul-2014 23:26:45]  <IllFlower> Hahaha.
[26-Jul-2014 23:27:32]  <IllFlower> Well, I think it might be time to wake Sleeping Beauty.
[26-Jul-2014 23:27:48]  <Rig> Sure. Works for me.
[26-Jul-2014 23:28:20]  <Rig> I have about half an hour before I need to move. Then I’ll be back in like 30 minutes if we want to continue.

[26-Jul-2014 23:28:30]  <Alicia> Sure.
[26-Jul-2014 23:28:38]  <BGTB2005> sure
[26-Jul-2014 23:28:40]  <IllFlower> As Yuuya and Kazuki stare at each other awkwardly, waiting to see who's going to be the first to leave, Yuuya's interrupted by the ringing of his cell phone.
[26-Jul-2014 23:29:11]  <IllFlower> "Megumi woke up," Yuuya says, reading a text message off of the screen.
[26-Jul-2014 23:29:31]  <Rig> “We should go see her."
[26-Jul-2014 23:31:01]  <IllFlower> "Yeah," Yuuya says, his voice shaking somewhat. "I hope she's," and then nothing.
[26-Jul-2014 23:31:30]  <Rig> Kazuki pats Yuuya on the back a little awkwardly.
[26-Jul-2014 23:32:01]  <IllFlower> It's not long to St. Joseph's. The sentry the Conservators met a few days ago is posted there again today.
[26-Jul-2014 23:32:22]  <IllFlower> "Kinomoto!" he shouts as the group approaches.
[26-Jul-2014 23:32:56]  <IllFlower> Yuuya nods in return. "How's Megumi doing?"
[26-Jul-2014 23:33:57]  <IllFlower> "She's awake. Shaken, though. I'm not sure how much she can talk."
[26-Jul-2014 23:35:21]  <IllFlower> "Right. They, uh..." Yuuya indicates the Conservators with a shake of his head. "Have an interest here."
[26-Jul-2014 23:36:32]  <IllFlower> "Of course," the sentry says, stepping aside from the door.
[26-Jul-2014 23:38:55]  <IllFlower> "You should go ahead," Yuuya says to the Conservators. "There's not enough space in there for five of us."
[26-Jul-2014 23:39:12]  <Rig> “We’ll make it quick,” Kazuki says as he steps inside.
[26-Jul-2014 23:40:14]  <IllFlower> Megumi's eyes are open, as advertised, but listless. It seems to be all they can do to trail the four people entering the room in quick succession.
[26-Jul-2014 23:40:38]  <IllFlower> Her bruises are slightly less vividly colored than last time, but only just.
[26-Jul-2014 23:41:08]  <IllFlower> "Conservators..." she says in a weak voice.
[26-Jul-2014 23:42:41]  <Rig> “Megumi,” Kazuki says. He steps up to her bed. She doesn’t look good. It’s even harder to believe the weak witch they fought under the bridge could do this to her.
[26-Jul-2014 23:42:50]  <Rig> “Can you tell us what happened to you?”
[26-Jul-2014 23:45:02]  <IllFlower> Good bedside manner.
[26-Jul-2014 23:45:24]  <ponicalica> Ayako stands by, waiting, as Kazuki has much better bedside manner than she does
[26-Jul-2014 23:45:26]  <Alicia> He's a smooth talker. Gets all of the ladies.
[26-Jul-2014 23:45:28]  <Alicia> (lol)
[26-Jul-2014 23:46:02]  <IllFlower> "I--"
[26-Jul-2014 23:46:37]  <IllFlower> Megumi's thoughts seem to shut down intermittently and then start again every few seconds.
[26-Jul-2014 23:47:16]  <Rig> “Is there anything we can do for her?” Kazuki asks Ayako.
[26-Jul-2014 23:49:08]  <IllFlower> Megumi finally coaxes out the words. "It was -- harder than it should have been. The -- the witch."
[26-Jul-2014 23:49:23]  <ponicalica> "Maybe.  I think the attack may have directly gone for her brain--hiding the evidence and all that."
[26-Jul-2014 23:49:53]  <IllFlower> Or maybe it's that she just woke up from nearly being strangled. :p
[26-Jul-2014 23:50:14]  <ponicalica> true, but this is Ayako, does she ever go for mundane explanations?
[26-Jul-2014 23:50:23]  <IllFlower> Does Ayako own a tinfoil hat?
[26-Jul-2014 23:51:01]  <Rig> “It’s okay, Megumi. It’s been taken care of and you’re safe now.”
[26-Jul-2014 23:51:52]  <IllFlower> Megumi shakes her head with two firm jerks from side to side.
[26-Jul-2014 23:53:08]  <IllFlower> "Kinomoto -- his attacks...
[26-Jul-2014 23:53:44]  <IllFlower> "They didn't seem to affect the witch at all.
[26-Jul-2014 23:54:14]  <IllFlower> "It was like -- like they were just illusions.
[26-Jul-2014 23:54:31]  <IllFlower> "I -- I tried to help, but -- it was too much --"
[26-Jul-2014 23:55:29]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at the other Conservators to see if they have the same idea.
[26-Jul-2014 23:55:42]  <ponicalica> Ayako whispers to Kazuki.  "What sort of magic does Kinomoto use?"
[26-Jul-2014 23:57:12]  <Rig> “He used traps when I knew him. Snares and illusions.” Kazuki says quietly.
[26-Jul-2014 23:57:45]  <Rig> “He could weave magic tight enough to make it almost seem like reality.”
[26-Jul-2014 23:58:18]  <Rig> I need to head home. Shall we call this a stopping point or would you like to continue when I get back?
[26-Jul-2014 23:58:30]  <BGTB2005> I'd like to continue
[26-Jul-2014 23:58:31]  <IllFlower> Up to you guys.
[26-Jul-2014 23:58:53]  <IllFlower> It seems like someone just had a revelation, though.
[26-Jul-2014 23:59:11]  <Rig> I’m good with continuing. I’m gonna grab some food on the way home. It’ll be around 30 minutes.
[26-Jul-2014 23:59:32]  <ponicalica> I'm fine with continuing.

[27-Jul-2014 00:36:16]  *** SF_Sorrow <SF_Sorrow@eduroam-241-61.ucsc.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[27-Jul-2014 00:36:25]  <IllFlower> Yuuya tilts his head in confusion. "Sure?"
[27-Jul-2014 00:38:15]  <IllFlower> He follows along with Kazuki, somewhat perplexed at his friend's sudden determination.
[27-Jul-2014 00:38:40]  <Rig> Kazuki makes his way to the stairs and they climb to the roof. The door is unlocked and Kazuki holds it open for Yuuya to pass through first. The group stands in front of the door as Yuuya turns to face them.
[27-Jul-2014 00:38:50]  <Rig> Should we start a conflict?
[27-Jul-2014 00:39:01]  <ponicalica> 4 on 1?  That's not very fair, is it? :p
[27-Jul-2014 00:39:14]  <BGTB2005> seems perfectly fair for Rin
[27-Jul-2014 00:39:25]  <Rig> Well, it can be one on one at first. I just want to talk.
[27-Jul-2014 00:39:47]  <IllFlower> "Yup, we'll just let these kids onto the roof of the hospital. No problem there."
[27-Jul-2014 00:40:02]  <Rig> We wander around most the city like we own it.
[27-Jul-2014 00:40:04]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: clearly they realize how important the dramatic effect is
[27-Jul-2014 00:40:41]  <IllFlower> Rig: Well, what do you want from the conflict?
[27-Jul-2014 00:41:10]  <Rig> I want Kinomoto to tell us the truth about what happened under the bridge.
[27-Jul-2014 00:42:36]  <IllFlower> I get the feeling Kazuki just wants him to confess to something or other.
[27-Jul-2014 00:42:53]  <Rig> Probably what Kazuki actually wants.
[27-Jul-2014 00:43:20]  <Rig> But that’s certainly a conflict. The stake would be “Yuuya confesses”
[27-Jul-2014 00:43:42]  <IllFlower> I like that.
[27-Jul-2014 00:43:55]  <IllFlower> Whether or not he's guilty. ;)
[27-Jul-2014 00:43:58]  <Rig> Yes.
[27-Jul-2014 00:44:00]  <Rig> Exactly.
[27-Jul-2014 00:44:19]  <IllFlower> All right. Let me roll up some numbers, and then you can start.
[27-Jul-2014 00:44:29]  <Rig> Okay.
[27-Jul-2014 00:44:30]  <Alicia> Meanwhile, the girls watch, unsure of what to d.
[27-Jul-2014 00:44:39]  <Rig> d all the things.
[27-Jul-2014 00:44:44]  <Alicia> Well, aside from Rin looking at Kazuki.
[27-Jul-2014 00:44:45]  <Alicia> do*
[27-Jul-2014 00:44:47]  <Alicia> Pfft.
[27-Jul-2014 00:44:48]  <Rig> Actually, they can’t.
[27-Jul-2014 00:44:49]  <IllFlower> Just realized I reused the name "Saki". Derp.
[27-Jul-2014 00:45:01]  <BGTB2005> it happens
[27-Jul-2014 00:45:08]  <Rig> @dice clear
[27-Jul-2014 00:45:08]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Bank cleared.
[27-Jul-2014 00:45:26]  <ponicalica> Reused?
[27-Jul-2014 00:45:35]  <Rig> @dice add 8d6 + 1d6
[27-Jul-2014 00:45:35]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Invalid die group specification +.
[27-Jul-2014 00:45:40]  <ponicalica> oh, matsudaira, lol
[27-Jul-2014 00:45:44]  <Rig> @dice add 9d6
[27-Jul-2014 00:45:44]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Rolled 2 2 2 3 4 5 5 6 6 = 35. Bank now has 2 2 2 3 4 5 5 6 6 = 35.
[27-Jul-2014 00:45:50]  <ponicalica> People can have the same name, you know :P
[27-Jul-2014 00:46:56]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but for practical reasons it's better if they don't.
[27-Jul-2014 00:47:08]  <IllFlower> Especially since they're confusing enough for you all already.
[27-Jul-2014 00:47:22]  <IllFlower> Talking?
[27-Jul-2014 00:47:27]  <Rig> Yep.
[27-Jul-2014 00:47:39]  <ponicalica> Rig: it's just 8d6 1d6
[27-Jul-2014 00:47:41]  <IllFlower> @dice add 9d6
[27-Jul-2014 00:47:41]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 1 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 = 35. Bank now has 1 1 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 = 36.
[27-Jul-2014 00:47:45]  <Alicia> 5/6/4/5 huh.
[27-Jul-2014 00:47:50]  <IllFlower> Evenly matched. Hm.
[27-Jul-2014 00:47:54]  <ponicalica> what's the extra 1d6 for though
[27-Jul-2014 00:47:59]  <ponicalica> oh, the Yuuya relationship?
[27-Jul-2014 00:48:06]  <Rig> yeah
[27-Jul-2014 00:48:13]  <IllFlower> Hold on a sec.
[27-Jul-2014 00:48:41]  <IllFlower> @dice add 1d4 >! Kazuki
[27-Jul-2014 00:48:41]  <Omnipresence> 14: Rolled 2 = 2. Bank now has 1 1 2 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 = 38.
[27-Jul-2014 00:48:50]  <Rig> Heh.
[27-Jul-2014 00:48:51]  <IllFlower> Okay, Rig, you raise.
[27-Jul-2014 00:49:08]  <BGTB2005> there appears to be an extra 1 in there?
[27-Jul-2014 00:49:38]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: Rig rolled 5d6+3d6+1d6 Ht+Ac+Yuuya
[27-Jul-2014 00:50:12]  <BGTB2005> ponicalica: I'm talking about IllFlower's bank, unless there's something from the previous conflict I missed
[27-Jul-2014 00:50:26]  <IllFlower> @dice use 1
[27-Jul-2014 00:50:26]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 1 = 1. Bank now has 1 2 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 = 37.
[27-Jul-2014 00:50:31]  <IllFlower> I forgot to clear. Oops.
[27-Jul-2014 00:51:07]  <Rig> Kazuki advances on Yuuya. “Megumi told us something interesting,” he starts. “She seemed to think you were pulling your punches against that witch that almost killed her.”
[27-Jul-2014 00:51:10]  <BGTB2005> that's why you had @dice new, no?
[27-Jul-2014 00:51:25]  <Rig> @dice use 4 3

[27-Jul-2014 00:51:29]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Yeah. Mind's not in it.
[27-Jul-2014 00:52:36]  <IllFlower> "You're crazy," Yuuya says. "Nobody would do that. Not in front of a witch."

[27-Jul-2014 00:53:44]  <IllFlower> "What are you doing, Sakura? Are you desperate? Jealous? Treacherous? I don't understand."

[27-Jul-2014 00:55:06]  <Rig> “I’m doing my job, Kinomoto. Protecting that girl. Finding out why she was hurt like this.”

[27-Jul-2014 00:55:48]  <Rig> “And you? Are you doing your job? Your partner was hurt by a witch that was nothing but rumor. Insubstantial.”

[27-Jul-2014 00:58:51]  <ponicalica> dah dah dah
[27-Jul-2014 00:59:51]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at the ground. He has more evidence ready to throw in his friend’s face. But it isn’t enough. It doesn’t prove anything. It’s all conjecture and he knows it.
[27-Jul-2014 00:59:55]  <IllFlower> Gotta play the friend card last, man.
[27-Jul-2014 01:00:24]  <Rig> “I’m jealous, Kinomoto. I’m jealous of the chances you get that I don’t.”
[27-Jul-2014 01:00:27]  <Rig> Kazuki gives.
[27-Jul-2014 01:01:21]  <IllFlower> Man, man, man, Ayako's been missing something big here...
[27-Jul-2014 01:01:45]  <Rig> “I don’t know what happened to Megumi, but you’re the best lead we’ve got. And maybe I put  my feelings ahead of logic. I’m sorry, Kinomoto.”
[27-Jul-2014 01:02:08]  <Rig> Kazuki walks away, leaving the girls on the roof with his old friend.
[27-Jul-2014 01:02:21]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: how ashamed should I be
[27-Jul-2014 01:02:34]  <IllFlower> Yuuya tries to call for Kazuki, but it's for naught.
[27-Jul-2014 01:03:13]  <IllFlower> "I shouldn't have said that. That was -- harsh." Yuuya shakes his head in disappointment.
[27-Jul-2014 01:03:49]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Well, if you read through the logs for this branch you'll probably realize what she could do here. But it's not blindingly obvious.
[27-Jul-2014 01:03:53]  <Rig> (“Don’t be blinded”)
[27-Jul-2014 01:04:21]  <Rig> (Oh no, it was “Don’t blind yourself”)
[27-Jul-2014 01:04:42]  <ponicalica> I'm guessing it's something to do with scanning Yuuya
[27-Jul-2014 01:04:51]  <IllFlower> Anyway, gotta keep going!
[27-Jul-2014 01:05:00]  <ponicalica> but I'm not sure the best way to say it; I blame tiredness >_<
[27-Jul-2014 01:05:05]  <IllFlower> Unless you just want Yuuya to stand awkwardly with the girls for a while.
[27-Jul-2014 01:05:26]  <Rig> Rin still thinks Yuuya is a suspect and just tackles him.
[27-Jul-2014 01:05:34]  <Alicia> Oh lord.
[27-Jul-2014 01:05:47]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: That's an idea.
[27-Jul-2014 01:05:56]  <BGTB2005> But we don't have anything concrete
[27-Jul-2014 01:06:05]  <Rig> When has that stopped Rin?
[27-Jul-2014 01:06:18]  <IllFlower> Nah, she only wails on people she has a history with.
[27-Jul-2014 01:06:37]  <IllFlower> Oh, and none of them have been bishounen.
[27-Jul-2014 01:07:11]  <Rig> Okay, so what will you girls do?
[27-Jul-2014 01:07:13]  <IllFlower> Yuuya's clearly too much of a pretty boy for her to even think about punching.
[27-Jul-2014 01:07:38]  <Alicia> I say scan him but how would we do that.
[27-Jul-2014 01:07:50]  * BGTB2005 looks at Ayako
[27-Jul-2014 01:07:51]  <ponicalica> "Yuuya, do you mind if there's something I check?  I just want to make sure of something..."
[27-Jul-2014 01:08:15]  <IllFlower> "I... don't mind, no."
[27-Jul-2014 01:09:06]  <IllFlower> Yuuya turns to Ayako. "What is it?"
[27-Jul-2014 01:12:14]  <ponicalica> "The witch I saw traces of at the bridge seemed odd, more like an initiate's attack imitating one.  Since you were around, I just want to compare your magical 'feel' to its; I'm sure it's nothing, though, since a prophet-to-be wouldn't do this, would he?"
[27-Jul-2014 01:12:28]  <ponicalica> that line felt a bit odd but done is better than good I guess
[27-Jul-2014 01:12:54]  <Alicia> I like it.
[27-Jul-2014 01:13:44]  <IllFlower> lol, way to turn on the passive-aggressiveness.
[27-Jul-2014 01:14:09]  <IllFlower> I was thinking you would do the cloud thing, btu this works too.
[27-Jul-2014 01:14:13]  <Alicia> Probably from getting friendly with Hikari.
[27-Jul-2014 01:14:24]  <ponicalica> yeah we'll just say something like that
[27-Jul-2014 01:14:40]  <IllFlower> "You just need me to cast an enchantment or something, right?"
[27-Jul-2014 01:15:43]  <ponicalica> Then again, I feel like i've been a little inconsistent with how I want Ayako to go all campaign, but maybe that's just Rig being way better at playing characters to the hilt
[27-Jul-2014 01:16:25]  <Rig> It’s just that I can be stupidly demanding.
[27-Jul-2014 01:16:27]  <IllFlower> Yuuya extends an arm out towards the edge of the rooftop.
[27-Jul-2014 01:17:09]  <IllFlower> A single white thread emerges from between his fingers, seeming to disappear over the horizon.
[27-Jul-2014 01:17:13]  <IllFlower> "Is this enough?"
[27-Jul-2014 01:17:58]  <ponicalica> "We'll see."  Ayako begins an incantation similar to the one that Kazuki did near her.
[27-Jul-2014 01:18:07]  <ponicalica> (This is where I was going to bring the cloud in, heh)
[27-Jul-2014 01:19:17]  <IllFlower> As before, a wisp of white escapes from the thread at Ayako's prompting, hovering in the damp summer air.
[27-Jul-2014 01:19:58]  <IllFlower> For a long time, it simply sits there, colorless.
[27-Jul-2014 01:20:30]  <Rig> He’s an illusion!
[27-Jul-2014 01:20:33]  <IllFlower> Finally, just as Ayako begins to lose her patience, a faint hue suffuses through the cloud.
[27-Jul-2014 01:20:45]  <IllFlower> A familiar mix of purple and green.
[27-Jul-2014 01:21:34]  <BGTB2005> well then
[27-Jul-2014 01:21:41]  <IllFlower> Yuuya stares impassively. He either doesn't know or doesn't care about what this means.
[27-Jul-2014 01:22:58]  <IllFlower> (Kazuki, meanwhile, sits on a bench on the hospital's top floor, stewing in self-loathing.)
[27-Jul-2014 01:24:04]  <Rig> If you guys don’t remember: https://room208.org/logs/memoriam/sessions/26-under-the-bridge.html#L194
[27-Jul-2014 01:24:04]  <Omnipresence> 14URL: [room208.org] No title found.
[27-Jul-2014 01:24:10]  <IllFlower> <StephenColbert> Did I just blow your mind?
[27-Jul-2014 01:26:12]  <ponicalica> Part of me thinks we should strike, but part of me thinks that's the sort of thing that would have bad consequences against a candidate for prophetshit
[27-Jul-2014 01:26:16]  <ponicalica> *prophetship
[27-Jul-2014 01:26:22]  <Alicia> Lol.
[27-Jul-2014 01:26:24]  <IllFlower> Prophetshit works too.
[27-Jul-2014 01:26:35]  <BGTB2005> when has that ever stopped the party?
[27-Jul-2014 01:26:42]  <Alicia> Prophetshitp.
[27-Jul-2014 01:27:18]  <BGTB2005> Recalling where she'd seen that blend of colour before, Rin summons her cannon
[27-Jul-2014 01:27:39]  <IllFlower> There's the jumping-to-conclusions Rin we all know and love.
[27-Jul-2014 01:28:22]  <BGTB2005> a part of her does want to be wrong, but now she feels she does have something concrete
[27-Jul-2014 01:28:56]  <Rig> ^_^ I come back to the best things.
[27-Jul-2014 01:29:00]  <ponicalica> It's nice to have Rin's impulsiveness balance out Ayako's/my tentativeness XD
[27-Jul-2014 01:29:29]  <Alicia> It's nice how Hikari's not quite either, heh.
[27-Jul-2014 01:29:32]  <Alicia> Maybe.
[27-Jul-2014 01:29:34]  <IllFlower> So are we doing conflict?
[27-Jul-2014 01:29:51]  <Rig> The gun certainly implies conflict. Deadly conflict.
[27-Jul-2014 01:30:12]  <BGTB2005> good job rin
[27-Jul-2014 01:30:30]  <Alicia> Well well well.
[27-Jul-2014 01:30:35]  <Rig> Of course, Ayako can jump in and try to defuse it to talking.
[27-Jul-2014 01:30:36]  <ponicalica> Rig: Technically the gun could be used in a social conflict, as a threat or something, I think?
[27-Jul-2014 01:30:40]  <IllFlower> Well, we need stakes.
[27-Jul-2014 01:30:40]  <Rig> Yeah.
[27-Jul-2014 01:30:42]  <BGTB2005> at least, on the plus side, they're on top of a hosptial
[27-Jul-2014 01:30:48]  <BGTB2005> *hospital
[27-Jul-2014 01:31:04]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that just makes the irony of a dead body falling from the roof all the juicier.
[27-Jul-2014 01:31:08]  <Alicia> Stakes: He spills what's up with his magic being there?
[27-Jul-2014 01:31:12]  <IllFlower> Oh, was that not what you were going for?
[27-Jul-2014 01:31:19]  <IllFlower> ;)
[27-Jul-2014 01:31:35]  <Alicia> Well, yeah...
[27-Jul-2014 01:31:53]  <IllFlower> No irony? Okay.
[27-Jul-2014 01:32:14]  <Alicia> It was an idea. :I
[27-Jul-2014 01:32:23]  <IllFlower> Seriously, though. I dunno if it's necessary to start at magic if all you want is an explanation.
[27-Jul-2014 01:32:38]  <Alicia> Yeah. But Hikari didn't get out her gun!
[27-Jul-2014 01:32:46]  <Alicia> That was a certain other girl.
[27-Jul-2014 01:33:14]  <IllFlower> Yeah, yeah, Annie over there.
[27-Jul-2014 01:33:29]  <Alicia> You dork.
[27-Jul-2014 01:33:41]  <Rig> Shoot first, ask questions later.
[27-Jul-2014 01:33:42]  <ponicalica> Are we allowed to go for an explanation, or is that sufficiently different from a confession
[27-Jul-2014 01:33:43]  <Rig> Or never.
[27-Jul-2014 01:33:45]  <Rig> Never is good.
[27-Jul-2014 01:33:54]  <ponicalica> Rig: that is Rin's philosophy
[27-Jul-2014 01:34:14]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@182.55.189.100> has joined #madokamadness
[27-Jul-2014 01:34:55]  <IllFlower> I mean, it looks to me like Rin just wants to kill Yuuya.
[27-Jul-2014 01:35:08]  <Alicia> Step down from prophetship, maybe?
[27-Jul-2014 01:35:22]  <Alicia> "Tell us what's up and stop doing your Yuuya things."
[27-Jul-2014 01:35:25]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: The stakes are pretty different. "Explain why these colors are the same" vs. "confess!"
[27-Jul-2014 01:35:38]  <Alicia> Or there's that yeah.
[27-Jul-2014 01:36:10]  <IllFlower> But still, Rin's thing seems more like lethal force for its own sake than trying to get an explanation.
[27-Jul-2014 01:36:44]  <BGTB2005> small side question
[27-Jul-2014 01:36:44]  <IllFlower> Just casting about for the proper stakes here is all.
[27-Jul-2014 01:36:47]  <ponicalica> Rin just likes swinging around her cannon
[27-Jul-2014 01:37:03]  <IllFlower> She's got some big cannonballs.
[27-Jul-2014 01:37:10]  <BGTB2005> did we think to check Kotomi for magic fingerprints?
[27-Jul-2014 01:37:17]  <IllFlower> Nope.
[27-Jul-2014 01:37:18]  <Rig> Nope.
[27-Jul-2014 01:37:35]  <ponicalica> I think Ayako wants an explanation more than anything else, and probably the same to Hikari, but Rin probably just wants to shoot someone.
[27-Jul-2014 01:37:38]  <Rig> So, are we doing conflict. I kind of want to wrap this up around 10-ish if that’s okay?
[27-Jul-2014 01:37:53]  <IllFlower> Mm, same.
[27-Jul-2014 01:38:03]  <Alicia> Hikari doesn't want someone to die, just for them to stop whatever it is they're doing.
[27-Jul-2014 01:38:07]  <IllFlower> If we're gonna shootmagic we gotta shootmagic fast.
[27-Jul-2014 01:38:09]  <Alicia> potentially die*
[27-Jul-2014 01:38:31]  <IllFlower> Right now I think someone should try to convince Yuuya to explain himself.
[27-Jul-2014 01:38:32]  <ponicalica> Almost 10-ish means 20 minutes, right?
[27-Jul-2014 01:38:38]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[27-Jul-2014 01:39:13]  <IllFlower> SO PICK YOUR STAKES 'CAUSE WE'RE ROLLIN'
[27-Jul-2014 01:39:16]  <Alicia> Hikari can speakmagic while Rin threatens with her cannongun.
[27-Jul-2014 01:39:23]  <Alicia> Stakes, confession?
[27-Jul-2014 01:39:26]  <IllFlower> What is this, Newspeak?
[27-Jul-2014 01:39:29]  <Alicia> What he's up to.
[27-Jul-2014 01:39:34]  <Alicia> IllFlower: ;-;
[27-Jul-2014 01:39:39]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Can't do confession, we just did that.
[27-Jul-2014 01:39:45]  <Alicia> Doy, right.
[27-Jul-2014 01:41:58]  <Alicia> Ayako can*
[27-Jul-2014 01:42:10]  <BGTB2005> is getting him to explain himself a valid stake?
[27-Jul-2014 01:42:19]  <ponicalica> I think so, yes.
[27-Jul-2014 01:42:34]  <IllFlower> Indeed it is.
[27-Jul-2014 01:43:38]  <IllFlower> Who's going here?
[27-Jul-2014 01:43:53]  <IllFlower> I encourage one person to do the talking. :p
[27-Jul-2014 01:44:18]  <ponicalica> I think Ayako would probably be most appropriate, if it's only one person?
[27-Jul-2014 01:44:25]  <Alicia> Ayako makes sense, since she's magical but also not ready to blow someone's brains out.
[27-Jul-2014 01:44:27]  <IllFlower> Then so shall she go.
[27-Jul-2014 01:44:41]  <IllFlower> She was the one who pulled the evidence.
[27-Jul-2014 01:45:03]  <IllFlower> Okay, then. Ac+Ht. Let's do this. ponicalica, raise first.
[27-Jul-2014 01:45:06]  <ponicalica> @dice new 5d6 3d6
[27-Jul-2014 01:45:06]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Rolled 2 2 2 4 5 5 6 6 = 32. Bank now has 2 2 2 4 5 5 6 6 = 32.
[27-Jul-2014 01:45:07]  <IllFlower> @dice new 9d6
[27-Jul-2014 01:45:07]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 5 5 = 26. Bank now has 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 5 5 = 26.
[27-Jul-2014 01:45:13]  <BGTB2005> and Rin will stand there and look vaguely threatening
[27-Jul-2014 01:45:21]  <BGTB2005> ooh nice
[27-Jul-2014 01:45:43]  <Alicia> Hikari, uh, adjusts her brass knux I guess.
[27-Jul-2014 01:47:49]  <ponicalica> "It's the same.  The same residue I saw on Megumi, and the same strings that lashed out at me when we went to the bridge.  That's definitely suspicious."
[27-Jul-2014 01:47:53]  <ponicalica> hopefully this isn't overreaching
[27-Jul-2014 01:48:09]  <ponicalica> @dice use 5 6
[27-Jul-2014 01:48:09]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Used 5 6 = 11. Bank now has 2 2 2 4 5 6 = 21.
[27-Jul-2014 01:48:35]  <ponicalica> or too weak for an 11.  can't really tell >_<
[27-Jul-2014 01:49:03]  <IllFlower> Hm...
[27-Jul-2014 01:49:10]  <IllFlower> I don't like these odds. Well.
[27-Jul-2014 01:50:19]  <IllFlower> "I don't know what you're talking about," Yuuya says, much less convincingly than before. It's clear he's no longer got any way to defend himself.
[27-Jul-2014 01:51:02]  <IllFlower> @dice use 5 4 2
[27-Jul-2014 01:51:02]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 2 4 5 = 11. Bank now has 1 1 2 3 3 5 = 15.
[27-Jul-2014 01:51:06]  <IllFlower> Take 3d4 fallout.
[27-Jul-2014 01:51:40]  <IllFlower> Yuuya lets the thread fade from his hand and takes a step toward the girls.
[27-Jul-2014 01:52:01]  <IllFlower> He looks back toward the door that Kazuki left through moments ago.
[27-Jul-2014 01:53:00]  <IllFlower> "You know what? Fine. I don't have anything to prove to you three."
[27-Jul-2014 01:54:24]  <IllFlower> He's visibly angered now, but still he says, "Sakura's gone. I'll talk."
[27-Jul-2014 01:54:30]  <IllFlower> Give, keeping 5.
[27-Jul-2014 01:55:05]  <Rig> Wow. So hurt.
[27-Jul-2014 01:55:27]  <Alicia> Poor Kazuki.
[27-Jul-2014 01:55:46]  <ponicalica> a theme of this arc is clearly that Kazuki Sakura is kind of a stuck-up dick
[27-Jul-2014 01:56:50]  <IllFlower> "Binding magic's mine. Witch was my responsibility, inasmuch as you can directly create a witch."
[27-Jul-2014 01:57:12]  <IllFlower> Yuuya's sentences are short, perfunctory, blunt even.
[27-Jul-2014 01:58:07]  <IllFlower> "You've figured it out, haven't you? Why a hollow witch would be a good distraction."
[27-Jul-2014 02:01:07]  <ponicalica> I'm actually not 100% sure what he's implying here?
[27-Jul-2014 02:01:51]  <IllFlower> It was in another city, remember. Not where Kotomi was.
[27-Jul-2014 02:05:00]  <IllFlower> "It was just supposed to be a ball of rumor. Draw people away. I wasn't supposed to fight it. Tried to tell Masakichi that. Almost worked.
[27-Jul-2014 02:05:36]  <IllFlower> "But then he went back on it and sent me. What was I supposed to do? You can't fight your own magic.
[27-Jul-2014 02:06:45]  <IllFlower> "Whole thing went south there. I knew I'd be found out. Just didn't want to run until I absolutely had to. Would have been a dead giveaway.
[27-Jul-2014 02:07:13]  <IllFlower> "But now you've found Megumi, you've found Kotomi, you've found me. The game's up."
[27-Jul-2014 02:08:03]  <IllFlower> Yuuya is starting to ramble. He's clearly waiting for something to happen, and soon.
[27-Jul-2014 02:10:45]  <IllFlower> Anybody?
[27-Jul-2014 02:11:14]  <ponicalica> Alicia has something she said in PMs to me and asked about so I'll let her say that
[27-Jul-2014 02:11:22]  <Nitya> i cast magic missile at the darkness
[27-Jul-2014 02:11:30]  <Alicia> "Either way, you've messed up and still want to become a Prophet. What were you expecting to do then? Hikari prods him, still not really content with Yuuya's answers.
[27-Jul-2014 02:11:36]  <Rig> Shall Kazuki crash in at this point and confess his love.
[27-Jul-2014 02:11:37]  <IllFlower> I'm not gonna bite your head off if you discuss things in here. `_`
[27-Jul-2014 02:11:40]  <Alicia> " Hikari*
[27-Jul-2014 02:11:51]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Right, sorry. >_<
[27-Jul-2014 02:12:01]  <IllFlower> Rig: Whenever.
[27-Jul-2014 02:12:52]  <IllFlower> "When it was just me and Kotomi? Nobody would have missed her. Everything was fine then."
[27-Jul-2014 02:14:05]  <ponicalica> "How can you plan such a thing and even wish to become a Prophet?"
[27-Jul-2014 02:14:07]  <Alicia> "You left a wanted cult leader alive. Harmed, and weakened, but alive. Nothing was ever fine, regardless of her status."
[27-Jul-2014 02:14:13]  <IllFlower> Nitya: You cast it into a nearby wall! The splash damage engulfs you! You are dead...
[27-Jul-2014 02:14:34]  <Nitya> damn, i'll never be prophet now
[27-Jul-2014 02:14:41]  <IllFlower> Kinda missing the elephant in the room.
[27-Jul-2014 02:15:25]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: "Why not? It would have worked."
[27-Jul-2014 02:15:35]  <IllFlower> Yuuya shakes his head. "She came to me in the first place. She brought it on herself."

[27-Jul-2014 02:21:55]  <IllFlower> "She wanted to blackmail me.
[27-Jul-2014 02:24:07]  <IllFlower> "Look, that meditation thing she did? I helped her come up with it. The ropes, all that? That was my idea. We were friends, okay? But then she started her cult and disappeared. I thought that would be the end of it.
[27-Jul-2014 02:25:58]  <IllFlower> "Three weeks ago, she comes back. Begs me to take her in. We were friends. I say no, there's no way I can do that. I can't associate with you any more. She turns around and tells me that if I don't, she'll turn herself in and spill. Everything. About me.
[27-Jul-2014 02:26:46]  <IllFlower> "Can't let her do that. Just can't."
[27-Jul-2014 02:27:57]  <IllFlower> Yuuya's eyes dart back and forth across the roof.
[27-Jul-2014 02:28:06]  <Alicia> "You should have listened to her. By the time she wakes up, we will have all the information we need about her, the cult, and you."
[27-Jul-2014 02:28:23]  <Alicia> "Even if you have been very helpful so far."
[27-Jul-2014 02:29:33]  <IllFlower> "Nobody would have found her. Nobody would have believed her even if someone had.
[27-Jul-2014 02:30:05]  <IllFlower> "Everything went sideways when I fought that witch."
[27-Jul-2014 02:30:16]  <Nitya> 14so y'all know his crack squad of goons is gonna break in and fuck you up and that's the only reason he's telling you anything right
[27-Jul-2014 02:30:44]  <IllFlower> Yuuya gathers himself for long enough to look at the three girls.
[27-Jul-2014 02:30:55]  <IllFlower> "It's over. It's my turn to vanish."
[27-Jul-2014 02:31:45]  <Alicia> Hikari turns to Ayako, whispering "Think you can do something?"
[27-Jul-2014 02:32:08]  <IllFlower> Yuuya bolts, making for the edge of the roof.
[27-Jul-2014 02:32:26]  <BGTB2005> Rin darts after, summoning her wings
[27-Jul-2014 02:32:39]  <ponicalica> "I think this is more Rin's expertise."
[27-Jul-2014 02:32:43]  <IllFlower> Well, I think we'd have a conflict, but it's a bit late.
[27-Jul-2014 02:32:53]  <BGTB2005> Next session?
[27-Jul-2014 02:33:01]  <Nitya> conflict between: wings, feet
[27-Jul-2014 02:33:07]  <BGTB2005> and gravity
[27-Jul-2014 02:33:09]  <Alicia> I'm fine with continuing this next session. Stakes, his incapacitation.
[27-Jul-2014 02:33:27]  <IllFlower> I've got a 5! Important.
[27-Jul-2014 02:33:48]  <Alicia> 5/6/4/5 yeah...
[27-Jul-2014 02:33:53]  <IllFlower> All right. Well, thanks for sticking around for another long session.
[27-Jul-2014 02:34:01]  <Rig> Thanks, IllFlower.
[27-Jul-2014 02:34:08]  <IllFlower> Next time we can pound some fists into faces.
[27-Jul-2014 02:34:12]  <Rig> It was fun. I’ll need to find a way to wrap Kazuki back into this.
[27-Jul-2014 02:34:22]  <Alicia> Now Kazuki can be happy that neither of them are fit for Prophetship!
[27-Jul-2014 02:34:23]  <IllFlower> Until then.
