[15-Feb-2014 21:05:40]  <IllFlower> All right, shall we get started?
[15-Feb-2014 21:05:49]  <Rig> Ready
[15-Feb-2014 21:05:52]  <Alicia> I'm up.
[15-Feb-2014 21:06:11]  <Saladofstones> I'm ready
[15-Feb-2014 21:06:11]  <IllFlower> Since we essentially hit a stopping point last time, it's up to you guys what to do next.
[15-Feb-2014 21:06:27]  <IllFlower> Hikari and Hibiki (they sound like twins) doubtless need to be brought up to speed.
[15-Feb-2014 21:08:39]  <Rig> So, as of last session we know where Minami is hiding, right?
[15-Feb-2014 21:09:13]  <IllFlower> Yes, Ayako managed to track her location down.
[15-Feb-2014 21:09:27]  <IllFlower> Are you thinking of confronting her again?
[15-Feb-2014 21:09:49]  <Alicia> It'd be easier with more people, maybe? Problem is Jun and Ayako aren't in fighting condition.
[15-Feb-2014 21:10:04]  <Alicia> (Well, same as before but more.)
[15-Feb-2014 21:10:08]  <ponicalica> Nah, only Jun was in not-fighting-condition.
[15-Feb-2014 21:10:27]  <ponicalica> Ayako's only not in fighting condition because she's got really bad stats in everything but Ac
[15-Feb-2014 21:10:43]  <Alicia> Aah.
[15-Feb-2014 21:11:23]  <ponicalica> "I'm a lover, not a fighter!" "You're not much of a lover either really."
[15-Feb-2014 21:11:45]  <IllFlower> Ayako's boyfriend then proceeds to dump her.
[15-Feb-2014 21:12:11]  <Alicia> Ahah. :(
[15-Feb-2014 21:12:14]  <ponicalica> ("I didn't even know I had a boyfriend.")
[15-Feb-2014 21:12:25]  <IllFlower> That's just how bad of a lover she is.
[15-Feb-2014 21:12:34]  <Barcodrawing> HEE.
[15-Feb-2014 21:12:35]  <Barcodrawing> hee.*
[15-Feb-2014 21:12:51]  <Alicia> Wow, Kotomi is stronk.
[15-Feb-2014 21:13:23]  <Rig> So, Jun would want to confront Minami, but also knows that it isn't likely to go well.
[15-Feb-2014 21:13:52]  <ponicalica> Ayako's pretty much in the same boat, hence why she tried to avoid detection.
[15-Feb-2014 21:14:09]  <IllFlower> Oh, hm, nobody's notified the familiars about what happened yet.
[15-Feb-2014 21:14:26]  <Rig> We should ask the familiars to nuke the place from magical orbit.
[15-Feb-2014 21:14:39]  <Alicia> Hikari would want to take it to Minami, but not in this situation.
[15-Feb-2014 21:14:44]  <Alicia> So...
[15-Feb-2014 21:14:51]  <Rig> Okay, so, how about we meet up with Shii again.
[15-Feb-2014 21:14:53]  <IllFlower> Rig: And who do you think they'd get to do it? Probably the Conservators.
[15-Feb-2014 21:15:02]  <IllFlower> Hope you brought your nukes.
[15-Feb-2014 21:15:08]  <Rig> Yeah, but can we do an orbital drop in this setting?
[15-Feb-2014 21:15:26]  <BGTB2005> If only Hitomi were still active...
[15-Feb-2014 21:15:32]  <ponicalica> What do you think they'd drop on it though, Rig?
[15-Feb-2014 21:15:34]  <ponicalica> Probably the Conservators.
[15-Feb-2014 21:15:37]  <IllFlower> "Atmosphere becomes too thin to breathe. Take 6d8 fallout."
[15-Feb-2014 21:15:59]  <Rig> If Batman can breathe in space I think some teenagers could do it.
[15-Feb-2014 21:16:06]  <IllFlower> Rig: Okay, why not. Hibiki will have to explain to Shii what exactly she's doing, though.
[15-Feb-2014 21:16:10]  <BGTB2005> magical teenagers
[15-Feb-2014 21:16:13]  <Alicia> Especially if they're magical.
[15-Feb-2014 21:16:16]  <Alicia> Heh.
[15-Feb-2014 21:16:55]  <Rig> Do you want to set the scene up?
[15-Feb-2014 21:16:58]  <Saladofstones> my idea is that hibiki's task was to figure out what killed sanae, she had a glitch in time/space because of 4th wall issues, and is being assigned to follow it up
[15-Feb-2014 21:17:22]  <IllFlower> Rig: If you don't mind.
[15-Feb-2014 21:17:50]  <ponicalica> Wait, what are we setting up?  A conflict with Shii?
[15-Feb-2014 21:18:01]  <Rig> Yes.
[15-Feb-2014 21:18:06]  <Rig> We're gonna kick that rat's ass.
[15-Feb-2014 21:18:19]  <Alicia> Wait, why a conflict with Shii?
[15-Feb-2014 21:18:33]  <Rig> Because he wants pink madoka to make a contract.
[15-Feb-2014 21:18:38]  <IllFlower> Because you gotta stick it to the man.
[15-Feb-2014 21:18:50]  <ponicalica> Alicia: To get authorization to use the magical equivalent of a nuke, I think.
[15-Feb-2014 21:19:05]  <IllFlower> The female man.
[15-Feb-2014 21:19:10]  <Barcodrawing> feman.
[15-Feb-2014 21:19:16]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: The woman?
[15-Feb-2014 21:19:23]  <Rig> Nah, I think right now we're just supposed to inform Shii of what happened.
[15-Feb-2014 21:19:32]  <Rig> And figure out what to do next.
[15-Feb-2014 21:19:39]  <Rig> Possibly Magic Girl SWAT.
[15-Feb-2014 21:19:41]  <Barcodrawing> <<Look, we fucked up once and that wasn't even when the people were killing people. I cast "you cast magical missile at the darkness".>> or that
[15-Feb-2014 21:19:55]  <Barcodrawing> meguswat would be good.
[15-Feb-2014 21:20:06]  * IllFlower puts on "We Have Explosive"
[15-Feb-2014 21:20:11]  <Alicia> Then presumably Shii calls over Hikari too, whom got rerouted several times and wasn't able to make it.
[15-Feb-2014 21:20:18]  <Alicia> Or, something.
[15-Feb-2014 21:20:21]  <Alicia> >.>;
[15-Feb-2014 21:20:21]  <BGTB2005> yay bus routes?
[15-Feb-2014 21:20:37]  <Rig> She switched to the wrong line at a hub.
[15-Feb-2014 21:20:40]  <Rig> I did that once.
[15-Feb-2014 21:20:41]  <IllFlower> It's easiest if the girls just all show up. Their respective excuses for being late can wait.
[15-Feb-2014 21:20:50]  <Alicia> Okay, yeah.
[15-Feb-2014 21:24:25]  <IllFlower> So, uh, who's present?
[15-Feb-2014 21:24:34]  <Rig> At the meeting?
[15-Feb-2014 21:24:39]  <ponicalica> Presumably Shii and the four initiates.
[15-Feb-2014 21:24:50]  <IllFlower> Just checking to see if you're all still alive.
[15-Feb-2014 21:25:04]  <ponicalica> ("Do I really have to say «initiates»?  We're all girls here.")
[15-Feb-2014 21:25:14]  <ponicalica> I'm waiting for Rig to say something, since he was going to set things up.
[15-Feb-2014 21:25:27]  <Rig> No, IllFlower was setting it up.
[15-Feb-2014 21:25:37]  <Rig> Unless we simultaneously misunderstood each other.
[15-Feb-2014 21:25:41]  <ponicalica> I think you did.
[15-Feb-2014 21:25:48]  <Alicia> Present.
[15-Feb-2014 21:25:51]  <IllFlower> Good job, us.
[15-Feb-2014 21:25:54]  <Rig> See, I asked if he wanted to set up the scene.
[15-Feb-2014 21:25:56]  <Rig> And he said yes.
[15-Feb-2014 21:26:11]  <Rig> So, I was waiting for him to scene it up.
[15-Feb-2014 21:26:17]  <IllFlower> Oh, I misread your question. Welp.

[15-Feb-2014 21:26:42]  <Alicia> Nice.
[15-Feb-2014 21:26:42]  <Barcodrawing> the girls stare at each other blankly for four minutes

[15-Feb-2014 21:27:13]  <Rig> Does this mean that you want me to set up the scene, IllFlower?
[15-Feb-2014 21:27:23]  <IllFlower> I'll do it.
[15-Feb-2014 21:27:39]  <Rig> kay
[15-Feb-2014 21:27:49]  <IllFlower> After staking out Minami, Jun and Ayako arrange a meeting with Shii and the other two girls.
[15-Feb-2014 21:28:30]  <Rig> (Do you know how to contact that weird girl we met at the murder scene?)
[15-Feb-2014 21:28:44]  <IllFlower> Over the course of about twenty minutes, the girls trickle into a small office housed in an abandoned church.
[15-Feb-2014 21:29:49]  <IllFlower> Hibiki comes in last. It took a little while for the summons to get to her through the grapevine.
[15-Feb-2014 21:30:21]  <IllFlower> "I take it you have news for me," Shii says, when all of the girls are present. She raises an eyebrow at Hibiki's presence, but otherwise lets it go unremarked.
[15-Feb-2014 21:30:55]  <Barcodrawing> this cat has eyebrows, huh
[15-Feb-2014 21:31:18]  <Barcodrawing> well, it is an alien, i guess.
[15-Feb-2014 21:32:20]  <IllFlower> I've never made any definitive statement about Shii's appearance, so by the end of this campaign the only conclusion will be that she's an amorphous blob with twelve faces.
[15-Feb-2014 21:32:27]  <Rig> Jun speaks up, "We found the initiate responsible for the murder of Sanae and possibly the attacks on Aki."
[15-Feb-2014 21:32:45]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Shii: actually the Dodecahedron from the Phantom Tollbooth
[15-Feb-2014 21:32:46]  <Rig> "Ayako and I tried to capture her, but failed."
[15-Feb-2014 21:33:41]  <ponicalica> "However, I was able to silently track her when she ran away to safety...here."  She points to a position on a map(probably Google's, really).
[15-Feb-2014 21:33:44]  <IllFlower> "Who's the initiate?" Shii asks. "I need to make sure the relevant parties are informed.
[15-Feb-2014 21:33:50]  <IllFlower> "And how did you find out so quickly?"
[15-Feb-2014 21:33:53]  <Alicia> "Do you still know where she is?" Hikari asks, worry in her voice.
[15-Feb-2014 21:35:38]  <Rig> "We followed the lead you gave us about Mizu-chin. Mizu-chin pointed us to Minami. Minami pretty much confessed to murder to Ayako and myself."
[15-Feb-2014 21:37:01]  <IllFlower> Shii nods. "It's not exactly subtle of her.
[15-Feb-2014 21:37:13]  <IllFlower> "You say she's already tried to go into hiding? That would make sense.
[15-Feb-2014 21:37:15]  <Rig> "Murder is hardly subtle either."

[15-Feb-2014 21:37:46]  <IllFlower> "No, I suppose not, but she at least had a chance at not being found out."
[15-Feb-2014 21:38:26]  <Rig> "Maybe it's a trap. She confesses and lures us into her 'hiding place' for an ambush."
[15-Feb-2014 21:39:13]  <IllFlower> "She did manage to overpower two of you. I'm surprised she didn't make an attempt on your lives."
[15-Feb-2014 21:39:48]  <Alicia> (You have such faith in your Conservators.)
[15-Feb-2014 21:40:09]  <Rig> "A moment of mercy doesn't make her a saint suddenly."
[15-Feb-2014 21:40:39]  <IllFlower> Rig: She's saying that preparation is of the essence.
[15-Feb-2014 21:40:44]  <ponicalica> "I think it's the opposite.  She was vicious with you.  I was afraid."
[15-Feb-2014 21:42:10]  *** SpruceZeus|away is now known as SpruceZeus
[15-Feb-2014 21:42:28]  <ponicalica> "It's also why I didn't even get a good look at her hideout.  I'd be at a disadvantage in a regular battle with her, much less if I turned out to be outnumbered.  At least now there's the four of us."
[15-Feb-2014 21:42:42]  <IllFlower> "Speaking of which..."
[15-Feb-2014 21:42:47]  <IllFlower> Shii turns to look at Hibiki.
[15-Feb-2014 21:42:53]  <IllFlower> "Who is this?"
[15-Feb-2014 21:43:11]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: I think it's your turn to introduce yourself.
[15-Feb-2014 21:43:44]  <Saladofstones> I'm alive
[15-Feb-2014 21:44:03]  <Barcodrawing> "my name is hov"
[15-Feb-2014 21:44:39]  <IllFlower> Jay-Z as a magical girl? Perish the thought.
[15-Feb-2014 21:45:05]  <BGTB2005> probably been done
[15-Feb-2014 21:45:20]  <ponicalica> didn't we have a rapper emgirl discussion during emburst too?
[15-Feb-2014 21:45:26]  <ponicalica> was that Kanye or Jay-Z?
[15-Feb-2014 21:45:35]  <IllFlower> "I got 99 problems but a witch ain't one" has probably been done to death.
[15-Feb-2014 21:45:46]  <ponicalica> probably

[15-Feb-2014 21:47:05]  <Saladofstones> *covers her mouth with her hand* Iihave some histroy with people like minami, so I am here to help. Iim just uh in shock
[15-Feb-2014 21:47:20]  <Saladofstones> (I have 4 free hours and in that time, everything happens)
[15-Feb-2014 21:47:24]  <Saladofstones> brb
[15-Feb-2014 21:48:10]  <IllFlower> Shii gives Hibiki a confused look, then turns to the other girls for an explanation.
[15-Feb-2014 21:48:34]  <ponicalica> "She showed up at the scene of Sanae's murder."
[15-Feb-2014 21:48:52]  <Rig> "Claimed to be sent there to investigate."
[15-Feb-2014 21:49:42]  <IllFlower> Shii runs through the possibilities in her mind.
[15-Feb-2014 21:49:53]  <IllFlower> "She does have the crest, so I assume this was just a miscommunication.
[15-Feb-2014 21:50:11]  <IllFlower> "Did she have anything to say about the scene?"
[15-Feb-2014 21:50:55]  <Rig> "She seemed insistent on us not being there, but that was about it."
[15-Feb-2014 21:51:38]  <IllFlower> "That's not particularly helpful." Shii frowns.
[15-Feb-2014 21:52:15]  <IllFlower> "Well, knowing what we know, are you going to go after Minami again?
[15-Feb-2014 21:52:28]  <ponicalica> "We should, but even with the four of us, it seems dangerous."
[15-Feb-2014 21:52:35]  <IllFlower> "You know where she is, but the likelihood of an ambush isn't negligible."
[15-Feb-2014 21:53:57]  <Rig> "We can't really risk her trying to kill another initiate."
[15-Feb-2014 21:54:01]  <Rig> Jun pauses for a moment.
[15-Feb-2014 21:54:15]  <Rig> "She said something when she confessed."
[15-Feb-2014 21:54:25]  <ponicalica> "Something about a reward, yes?"
[15-Feb-2014 21:54:40]  <Rig> "Yeah, two more and she'd get a reward."
[15-Feb-2014 21:54:40]  <IllFlower> "A reward?"
[15-Feb-2014 21:54:50]  <IllFlower> "Two more bodies."
[15-Feb-2014 21:54:54]  <Rig> "Must have been specific targets, if she didn't just kill us."
[15-Feb-2014 21:56:07]  <Rig> "But Sanae and Aki don't really have anything in common besides the symbol."
[15-Feb-2014 21:56:30]  <ponicalica> "They each had a boyfriend.  Or is that not special?"
[15-Feb-2014 21:57:03]  <BGTB2005> 14does the boyfriend need to be alive?
[15-Feb-2014 21:57:24]  <IllFlower> "I know you all talked to Akiko Yanase, but how much do you know of Sanae's situation?"
[15-Feb-2014 21:58:40]  <ponicalica> "Not much.  Just his existence, really."
[15-Feb-2014 21:59:14]  <IllFlower> "You didn't follow up with him like you did Akiko's boyfriend?"
[15-Feb-2014 21:59:35]  *** SF_Sorrow <~SF_Sorrow@college8-34-159.resnet.ucsc.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[15-Feb-2014 22:00:02]  <ponicalica> "Considering that Toshi was something of a dead end..."
[15-Feb-2014 22:00:37]  <IllFlower> "I see. That's understandable.
[15-Feb-2014 22:00:54]  <IllFlower> "I'm just hoping there exists a better option than just sending the four of you back after Tsuchida."
[15-Feb-2014 22:00:54]  <Alicia> "Yeah, he was... evasive. No help there."
[15-Feb-2014 22:02:29]  <Rig> "We could always attempt to wait her out," Jun suggests.
[15-Feb-2014 22:02:41]  <Rig> "Of course, if she slips by us people could die."
[15-Feb-2014 22:03:25]  <Barcodrawing> unfortunately, splitting between monitoring the hideout and more investigation would probably be ab ad idea, given her strength...
[15-Feb-2014 22:05:42]  <ponicalica> I almost want to suggest bribery since Minami's doing this for a reward, but 1) I don't think Conservators would be up for it 2) it's the least Ayako suggestion, really
[15-Feb-2014 22:05:55]  <IllFlower> "And what's the likelihood she actually needs to be physically present to conduct these attacks?
[15-Feb-2014 22:06:12]  <Rig> "We don't know how she's manipulating the witch."
[15-Feb-2014 22:06:24]  <Rig> "We also don't know who her next target would be."
[15-Feb-2014 22:06:35]  <IllFlower> "Then if she doesn't, people could die in either case."
[15-Feb-2014 22:07:07]  <IllFlower> Shii shakes her head as an awkward silence pervades the room.
[15-Feb-2014 22:07:24]  <Rig> Jun sighs, "Then we either charge in and try to stop her, find the witch and takes her down, or find what connects the targets and protect them."
[15-Feb-2014 22:07:45]  <Rig> "I don't... I can't make the decision this time though."
[15-Feb-2014 22:08:22]  <Alicia> "It seems like we'd be delaying the inevitable if we tried to protect the targets, if we could even find them. Sooner or later, we'd probably slip up..."
[15-Feb-2014 22:08:54]  <ponicalica> "If she's using a long-range magic to control a witch, would we be able to block it off and pen her in?  It might just draw her out and make her angrier, but at least we'd be on neutral turf rather than hers..."
[15-Feb-2014 22:09:01]  <ponicalica> Ayako flips through her notebook.
[15-Feb-2014 22:09:56]  <IllFlower> That's an interesting idea, but conflict-wise it feels odd.
[15-Feb-2014 22:10:10]  <ponicalica> true
[15-Feb-2014 22:10:17]  <IllFlower> I've got something, actually. A rather boring something, but something.
[15-Feb-2014 22:11:13]  <Rig> I think we could make something interesting out of the other conflict.
[15-Feb-2014 22:11:18]  <Rig> But let's hear your idea.
[15-Feb-2014 22:12:21]  <IllFlower> Oh, it basically involves just giving you guys more information instead of beating it out of Minami.
[15-Feb-2014 22:13:01]  <Alicia> I'm not necessarily opposed to that.
[15-Feb-2014 22:13:22]  <IllFlower> If you know how to turn ponicalica's idea into a viable conflict, though, I'd be all for that.
[15-Feb-2014 22:14:09]  <Alicia> We could try to lure her out while doing that. Use someone as bait, keep the others nearby.
[15-Feb-2014 22:14:13]  <Alicia> "Bait**
[15-Feb-2014 22:14:14]  <Barcodrawing> well, if it were true that she were doing this, which ayako would probably know, then you'd need to cut the connection somehow
[15-Feb-2014 22:14:15]  <Alicia> "**
[15-Feb-2014 22:14:36]  <Barcodrawing> which would need someone to come up with the connection first.

[15-Feb-2014 22:15:16]  <Rig> Okay, my idea was that Ayako would set up some big circle to cut off Minami's long-range magic, but this would draw out the witch's minions (what are those things called in madoka?) and we'd have to hold them off while Ayako raises the shield spell.
[15-Feb-2014 22:15:29]  <ponicalica> the minions are called "familiars" in PMMM
[15-Feb-2014 22:15:44]  <Rig> PMMMS.
[15-Feb-2014 22:15:59]  <Barcodrawing> heh.
[15-Feb-2014 22:16:17]  <Barcodrawing> Change: puella magica menstrual syndrome
[15-Feb-2014 22:16:19]  <IllFlower> The big problem is that I can't think of a way to fit this in the conflict mechanics. The obvious answer sounds like "Demonic Influence" but 4d6+5d10 is entirely too weak for it to be worthwhile.
[15-Feb-2014 22:16:33]  <Rig> Yeah, that's true.
[15-Feb-2014 22:16:52]  <Barcodrawing> IllFlower: if the witch Gives, could minami use the witch's follow-up dice to engage?
[15-Feb-2014 22:16:53]  <Rig> We could modify the mechanics a little.
[15-Feb-2014 22:17:04]  <Barcodrawing> witch --> demonic influence opponent, wahtever.
[15-Feb-2014 22:17:16]  <Barcodrawing> not that minami needs any more dice, but lol
[15-Feb-2014 22:17:18]  <IllFlower> Alternatively, you could stage this as a conflict against Minami...
[15-Feb-2014 22:17:24]  <Rig> Also a possible one.
[15-Feb-2014 22:17:49]  <Rig> And since we're down another player like always....
[15-Feb-2014 22:18:53]  <IllFlower> I'm hoping that sentence isn't meant to end with "we're all gonna die."
[15-Feb-2014 22:19:28]  <Rig> No. More just frustration.
[15-Feb-2014 22:20:08]  <IllFlower> Okay, I think we can try running with this idea of an "area conflict."
[15-Feb-2014 22:20:46]  <Rig> Is that okay with everyone?
[15-Feb-2014 22:21:15]  <ponicalica> This is Rig's idea?
[15-Feb-2014 22:21:29]  <Alicia> Totally fine with me.
[15-Feb-2014 22:21:35]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Your idea too. :p
[15-Feb-2014 22:22:02]  <ponicalica> I mean Rig's version of the conflict. :P
[15-Feb-2014 22:22:36]  <IllFlower> We rollin', then?
[15-Feb-2014 22:22:45]  <Rig> Sure.
[15-Feb-2014 22:22:56]  <ponicalica> Sure.
[15-Feb-2014 22:22:57]  <Rig> Who's setting up the scene?
[15-Feb-2014 22:23:25]  <IllFlower> The girls settle on their attack plan with Shii, then head off to the area where they suspect Minami is hiding.
[15-Feb-2014 22:23:49]  <IllFlower> It's well dark by now. Jun's parents aren't going to be happy about this.
[15-Feb-2014 22:24:26]  <Rig> ;-;
[15-Feb-2014 22:24:40]  <Alicia> Blame bus routes.
[15-Feb-2014 22:24:52]  <ponicalica> Didn't bus routes come up in MB, too, lol
[15-Feb-2014 22:24:52]  <IllFlower> The place appears to be a railyard. The tracks are filled with boxcars and shipping containers, but not a single human soul appears to be in sight.
[15-Feb-2014 22:25:37]  <IllFlower> By the looks of it, it wouldn't be surprising if Minami's holed up in one of those cars.
[15-Feb-2014 22:25:55]  <Alicia> Hell yes, railyards.
[15-Feb-2014 22:26:11]  <IllFlower> One of you should raise here. We'll start at magic.
[15-Feb-2014 22:26:13]  <Barcodrawing> covering arcs, people. can easily be caught out of cover between boxcars.
[15-Feb-2014 22:26:23]  <Rig> ponicalica: You should start the conflict.
[15-Feb-2014 22:26:40]  <ponicalica> Okay.  Which level does this start on again?
[15-Feb-2014 22:26:47]  <Barcodrawing> " We'll start at magic."

[15-Feb-2014 22:29:33]  <Rig> I think the stakes for this one is something like "Minami can't control the witch without leaving this area."
[15-Feb-2014 22:29:37]  <Rig> Yeah.
[15-Feb-2014 22:29:54]  <IllFlower> She'll... probably notice.

[15-Feb-2014 22:32:06]  <Alicia> Oh yes.
[15-Feb-2014 22:32:19]  <ponicalica> Are we assuming Hibiki's currently being interrogated by Shii or
[15-Feb-2014 22:32:21]  <Alicia> I'm just not sure what she should do. Ayako's got the magic...
[15-Feb-2014 22:32:28]  <ponicalica> Alicia: Run defense, basically.
[15-Feb-2014 22:32:31]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Seeing as how Saladofstones isn't here I don't think there's much we can do.
[15-Feb-2014 22:32:49]  <Alicia> Like, make sure Ayako is well ponicalica?
[15-Feb-2014 22:33:36]  <IllFlower> Keep the enraged witchkind from descending upon and consuming Ayako.
[15-Feb-2014 22:33:47]  <Alicia> Happily.

[15-Feb-2014 22:34:09]  <Alicia> Hikari cracks her knuckles and looks at Ayako.
[15-Feb-2014 22:34:10]  <ponicalica> lol
[15-Feb-2014 22:34:23]  <Barcodrawing> wouldn't the stakes be "complete the bubble"?
[15-Feb-2014 22:34:30]  <Alicia> to make sure she's ready*
[15-Feb-2014 22:34:38]  <Barcodrawing> "stop them from killing ayako" means ayako just takes the blow amap.
[15-Feb-2014 22:34:50]  <ponicalica> Barcodrawing: the stakes are "block off long-range magic"
[15-Feb-2014 22:34:58]  <IllFlower> Barcodrawing: I was kidding. Mostly.
[15-Feb-2014 22:35:05]  <Saladofstones> Illflower, rig, ponicalica: I apologize, I'm going to miss this time. I'll figure out a new time, if any
[15-Feb-2014 22:35:10]  <Barcodrawing> okay i'm getting severe fucking deja-vu
[15-Feb-2014 22:35:14]  <IllFlower> Considering the setup seems to be that Ayako's the tech, though, you get the idea.
[15-Feb-2014 22:35:33]  <Alicia> So what do I roll for this
[15-Feb-2014 22:35:34]  <Alicia> .
[15-Feb-2014 22:35:43]  <ponicalica> Alicia: Ac+Wl I think.
[15-Feb-2014 22:35:45]  <Rig> Ac+Wl and any relationships for now.
[15-Feb-2014 22:35:48]  <IllFlower> Alicia: It's a magical conflict, so roll Ac+Wl.
[15-Feb-2014 22:36:01]  <Barcodrawing> we can take cover in these bunkers if things get too dicey.
[15-Feb-2014 22:36:13]  <Barcodrawing> (are wimiliars magical zerglings?)
[15-Feb-2014 22:36:15]  <Alicia> I... forget how to roll. Just @roll XdX?

[15-Feb-2014 22:36:39]  <Alicia> Ac and Wl are 3 and 4.
[15-Feb-2014 22:36:47]  <IllFlower> Alicia: "@dice clear" then "@dice add 7d6"

[15-Feb-2014 22:45:36]  <IllFlower> Spotting the Conservators, who aren't yet protected by Ayako's magical circle, the mist descends on each of them with a grave keening sound.
[15-Feb-2014 22:46:04]  <Alicia> So Jun raises then me?

[15-Feb-2014 22:54:03]  <IllFlower> You need to see 10, not 9.
[15-Feb-2014 22:54:31]  <Alicia> Oh derp. How do I redo.
[15-Feb-2014 22:54:44]  <ponicalica> you add 4 and 5 back in
[15-Feb-2014 22:54:44]  <IllFlower> Add 4 5 back and use the new dice.
[15-Feb-2014 22:54:51]  <Alicia> @dice add 4 5

[15-Feb-2014 22:55:28]  <Rig> My turn to raise?
[15-Feb-2014 22:55:30]  <IllFlower> Okay, I think Jun's up next.
[15-Feb-2014 22:56:55]  <ponicalica> You know, considering how this is the second time Ayako's transformed after setting up the magical situation, she'd be kind of screwed in a series with more elaborate transformation sequences
[15-Feb-2014 22:57:26]  <Rig> Jun rushes up to the nearest sigil and leaps into the middle, scattering the offending phantoms with a burst of magic light. 
[15-Feb-2014 22:57:49]  <Rig> @dice use 3 6
[15-Feb-2014 22:57:50]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Used 3 6 = 9. Bank now has 2 3 3 6 6 = 20.

[15-Feb-2014 22:58:59]  <Rig> Picturing the part in ICO where you get the flail.
[15-Feb-2014 22:59:10]  <IllFlower> The phantoms caught in the light twist into ribbons and evaporate, but soon enough more emerge from the ground to take their place, resuming their assault on the runes.

[15-Feb-2014 22:59:33]  <IllFlower> Alicia: You don't have to
[15-Feb-2014 22:59:34]  <Rig> It's not a raise against you.
[15-Feb-2014 22:59:35]  <ponicalica> Alicia: good thing that was a see then
[15-Feb-2014 22:59:40]  <IllFlower> since this isn't a raise against you.
[15-Feb-2014 22:59:42]  <Alicia> Right.
[15-Feb-2014 22:59:47]  <IllFlower> It's your turn to raise, though.
[15-Feb-2014 22:59:50]  <Rig> IllFlower: This is against Minami, right?
[15-Feb-2014 22:59:54]  <Rig> Did you include her kept dice?
[15-Feb-2014 23:00:05]  <IllFlower> Oh, no, I didn't. Thanks for reminding me.

[15-Feb-2014 23:00:34]  <IllFlower> Well, that makes this conflict marginally less lopsided.
[15-Feb-2014 23:00:54]  <Rig> This is a game about challenge.
[15-Feb-2014 23:00:56]  <Barcodrawing> the ghost zerglings evaporate with repeated magical siege tank shelling.
[15-Feb-2014 23:01:33]  <IllFlower> A game about challenge and not having 3-on-1 conflicts be total routs.

[15-Feb-2014 23:12:34]  <ponicalica> Nah, it's thematically appropriate though.
[15-Feb-2014 23:13:07]  <ponicalica> I couldn't think of an appropriate raise not using the wand.
[15-Feb-2014 23:13:17]  <IllFlower> Fair enough.
[15-Feb-2014 23:16:56]  <IllFlower> ponicalica?
[15-Feb-2014 23:17:22]  <ponicalica> Ayako pulls out her wand and aims toward the edge of the runes she had completed; she wants those clear enough to continue them unbroken.  Even the sun seems to slightly dim for a second as she charges.  With her chant "CONVENI LUX" and a crack, a beam of light smashes into the phantoms blocking that edge of the runes.

[15-Feb-2014 23:22:42]  <ponicalica> Ayako blocks off her witch magic, accidentally kills her.
[15-Feb-2014 23:24:54]  <IllFlower> With a screech, the phantoms evaporate, and the large magical dome encloses the railyard.
[15-Feb-2014 23:25:01]  <IllFlower> It immediately fills with black smoke.

[15-Feb-2014 23:29:08]  <IllFlower> Given that Minami can't escape the seals without one of the Conservators noticing, perhaps now is a good time to storm the circle and take her down.
[15-Feb-2014 23:29:46]  <Rig> "Let's see if we can take her this time."
[15-Feb-2014 23:29:54]  <Rig> So, another conflict?

[15-Feb-2014 23:31:44]  <IllFlower> "Looks like you got me," Minami's voice calls out from inside the dark haze.
[15-Feb-2014 23:33:10]  <IllFlower> "I suppose this is where you walk in and take me away."
[15-Feb-2014 23:33:33]  <Rig> "Does that mean you're surrendering?"
[15-Feb-2014 23:34:05]  <IllFlower> "What does it sound like to you?"
[15-Feb-2014 23:35:22]  <ponicalica> ("It sounds kind of like sarcasm, to be honest.")

[15-Feb-2014 23:37:58]  <Rig> "Ayako, you should hold back and keep the circle up. Hikari and I will take her."
[15-Feb-2014 23:38:09]  <ponicalica> Rig: always for splitting the party.
[15-Feb-2014 23:38:24]  <Rig> It's worked well in the past.
[15-Feb-2014 23:38:31]  <Rig> (No, it hasn't.)

[15-Feb-2014 23:39:27]  <Alicia> Oh yeah.
[15-Feb-2014 23:39:28]  <Rig> I don't think sex works that way.

[15-Feb-2014 23:39:36]  <Alicia> ... pfffft.
[15-Feb-2014 23:39:46]  <IllFlower> For some reason I added Ayako in the middle of that sentence.
[15-Feb-2014 23:39:49]  <ponicalica> Ayako nods.  "Hikari, Jun, are you sure you don't want me?"

[15-Feb-2014 23:45:15]  <IllFlower> Jun calls out to Minami to establish her target's position, as she and Hikari press further into the circle.

[15-Feb-2014 23:59:10]  <Rig> You should add any relationships now. Like the d10 with Conservator
[15-Feb-2014 23:59:22]  <ponicalica> or she detransformed after I formed the bubble.  whoops

[16-Feb-2014 00:01:11]  <Barcode> man! fistfights in costume!
[16-Feb-2014 00:01:34]  <ponicalica> we had 'em on from when we were fighting phantoms to set up a magical barrier
[16-Feb-2014 00:02:07]  <IllFlower> I was hoping to inflict some good old-fashioned fallout with that attack, but I have to obey the dice.
[16-Feb-2014 00:02:16]  <IllFlower> Alicia: You have to see the 12 from earlier.
[16-Feb-2014 00:02:41]  <Alicia> Oh, my bad. Thinking.
[16-Feb-2014 00:04:17]  <IllFlower> If you see 6 6 then rewrite what happened to Hikari.
[16-Feb-2014 00:04:37]  <Alicia> She got punched in the gut and then fell down, yes?
[16-Feb-2014 00:04:51]  <IllFlower> No, you can change that according to your see.
[16-Feb-2014 00:04:57]  <Alicia> Ah.
[16-Feb-2014 00:05:04]  <Alicia> @dice use 6 6

[16-Feb-2014 00:05:08]  <IllFlower> It was a nice way to introduce the conflict, but again the dice take precedence.
[16-Feb-2014 00:05:26]  <IllFlower> So she notices something's amiss and ducks to the side at the last moment or something.
[16-Feb-2014 00:05:44]  <Alicia> She'll instead only get grazed/harmed a bit, then. I mean, it was a surprise attack.
[16-Feb-2014 00:06:00]  <ponicalica> It'll be cosmetic at worst, since you're seeing with two dice.
[16-Feb-2014 00:06:02]  <IllFlower> Taking damage like that would be equivalent to taking fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 00:06:15]  <Alicia> Oh, whoops. Okay.
[16-Feb-2014 00:06:18]  <IllFlower> So nothing serious, maybe a nick or something.
[16-Feb-2014 00:06:45]  <Barcode> you can b e worn down by fighting, just, actual damage is Fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 00:06:55]  <Barcode> but being worn down is basically just using dice.
[16-Feb-2014 00:06:57]  <Alicia> Hikari feels a brush past her hair, startling her into action, and resuming the same stance sans staff.
[16-Feb-2014 00:07:04]  <Alicia> (Alliteration accidental.)
[16-Feb-2014 00:07:33]  <IllFlower> The stranger stumbles as Hikari dodges out of the way, but quickly reasserts her footing.
[16-Feb-2014 00:07:39]  <IllFlower> Okay, who goes next?
[16-Feb-2014 00:07:45]  <IllFlower> We all have the same best two dice. -_-
[16-Feb-2014 00:08:00]  <ponicalica> go down to third? :P

[16-Feb-2014 00:08:05]  <Alicia> as she resumes*
[16-Feb-2014 00:08:22]  <Rig> I think Alicia should raise next
[16-Feb-2014 00:08:30]  <IllFlower> Rig: You have the most 6s.
[16-Feb-2014 00:08:34]  <Rig> Or I can.
[16-Feb-2014 00:09:16]  <IllFlower> I think it would make more sense for Jun to step in while Hikari gets her bearings.
[16-Feb-2014 00:09:50]  <IllFlower> Alicia has three 6s and I have two as Minami.
[16-Feb-2014 00:10:03]  <IllFlower> So Minami will get in there last, I suppose.
[16-Feb-2014 00:10:07]  <Rig> Jun is only caught off guard for a moment, but (as usual) her reflexes kick in. In a movement born from years of martial arts training she spins past Hikari and throws out a sweeping kick at the new attacker.

[16-Feb-2014 00:36:24]  <Rig> You could certainly roll for cracks under conflict, but that won't help.
[16-Feb-2014 00:36:25]  <Barcode> well, minami and co would have "possession" over her life, at least.
[16-Feb-2014 00:36:30]  <Alicia> Barcode: Crap, so I was right.
[16-Feb-2014 00:36:39]  <Alicia> Well, had the right idea for most.
[16-Feb-2014 00:36:53]  <Barcode> Alicia: that being said ponicalica probably can help you out so long as you don't get unlucky enough to roll instadeath
[16-Feb-2014 00:37:02]  <Alicia> ;_;
[16-Feb-2014 00:37:02]  <Barcode> post-fight (since you can help injured persons)
[16-Feb-2014 00:37:03]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: She'd have a chance to get medical attention first.
[16-Feb-2014 00:37:23]  <IllFlower> Ayako's basically the medic, huh.
[16-Feb-2014 00:37:27]  <Rig> You could call in your big scene trait.
[16-Feb-2014 00:37:37]  <Barcode> is it d8?
[16-Feb-2014 00:37:41]  <Alicia> Yes.
[16-Feb-2014 00:37:43]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Well, I'm the only one with good Acuity, so it falls under that position by default.
[16-Feb-2014 00:37:45]  <Rig> And then make a see where you basically bluff your way into doing the right thing.
[16-Feb-2014 00:37:55]  <Barcode> you have a 2 in 8 chance of that working, heh
[16-Feb-2014 00:38:02]  <Alicia> That's if I roll - yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 00:38:10]  <ponicalica> it's worth a shot
[16-Feb-2014 00:38:14]  <Alicia> But it's. Ninja.
[16-Feb-2014 00:38:16]  <Barcode> it's true, you don't have anything to losel;
[16-Feb-2014 00:38:20]  <Barcode> lose.*
[16-Feb-2014 00:38:25]  <Rig> You'd have to make a rather compelling see to make it make sense.
[16-Feb-2014 00:38:25]  <Alicia> @dice add 1d8

[16-Feb-2014 00:39:12]  <IllFlower> She tries to make a big scene and gets gashed across the forehead.
[16-Feb-2014 00:39:20]  <Alicia> Kiss my ring for good luck and hope I don't die, hah.
[16-Feb-2014 00:39:26]  <Alicia> ahah*
[16-Feb-2014 00:39:28]  <Barcode> i don't wanna encourage you or anything, heh. but either you run and he probably dies or you stick around and risk dying.
[16-Feb-2014 00:39:29]  <Rig> Yeah, even if I help you're still taking 3d10
[16-Feb-2014 00:39:39]  <Barcode> gl, miss
[16-Feb-2014 00:39:43]  <Rig> Actually, hang on.
[16-Feb-2014 00:39:45]  <Alicia> Either way it's bad, yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 00:39:48]  <Barcode> ?
[16-Feb-2014 00:40:08]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Also, if she gives, she doesn't necessarily die unless Jun loses. Though at that point Jun losing is basically inevitable.
[16-Feb-2014 00:40:28]  <Rig> IllFlower: Could I roll a trait to give help?
[16-Feb-2014 00:40:28]  <Barcode> oh, is it a 2 on 1 life stakes
[16-Feb-2014 00:40:49]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 00:41:14]  <Rig> Okay, well, this will either work and you'll be able to block or you'll still have to take fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 00:41:16]  <IllFlower> Barcode: They don't get the stakes at all until they've won the conflict.
[16-Feb-2014 00:41:30]  <IllFlower> Rig: You only need to lend her 1, I think.
[16-Feb-2014 00:41:38]  <Barcode> IllFlower: oh i know i meant like, your stakes are "jun AND hiiragi AND minami's lives"
[16-Feb-2014 00:41:45]  <Rig> I'd have to lend her enough to be able to see with two dice.
[16-Feb-2014 00:41:59]  <IllFlower> Rig: No, your help doesn't count against her for fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 00:42:03]  <Rig> Really?
[16-Feb-2014 00:42:11]  <Barcode> well, that'd explain why you would help at all, heh
[16-Feb-2014 00:42:15]  <Barcode> other than to force a blow i guess
[16-Feb-2014 00:42:32]  <IllFlower> "[I]f your friend is able to See with one die plus yours, that's a Reversal; with two dice plus yours, that's a Block or Dodge; with three dice plus yours, that's Taking the Blow for three dice of Fallout."
[16-Feb-2014 00:42:37]  <IllFlower> Page 73.
[16-Feb-2014 00:42:51]  <Barcode> (scene idea, in brown pose, if you do that: jun dodges the knife, but sees it heading towards hiiragi. flings out spell to smash it before it hits hiiragi, but that leaves her open TO....[next move])
[16-Feb-2014 00:43:13]  <Rig> Jun sees Hikari panicking and throws a shield out for her, exposing herself to backlash from the two initiates.
[16-Feb-2014 00:43:17]  <IllFlower> Hikari rolled for making a scene so her failure to do so should probably still figure into the see.

[16-Feb-2014 00:44:50]  <IllFlower> Yeah, something like that.
[16-Feb-2014 00:44:51]  <Rig> Yeah.

[16-Feb-2014 00:45:12]  <Barcode> ("also hiiragi is now glowing")
[16-Feb-2014 00:45:24]  <IllFlower> Okay, new round.
[16-Feb-2014 00:45:27]  <IllFlower> Rig has the most 6s, so Jun goes first now.
[16-Feb-2014 00:45:32]  <ponicalica> lol
[16-Feb-2014 00:45:43]  <IllFlower> Then Minami, then Hikari, then the new girl.
[16-Feb-2014 00:47:24]  <Alicia> Hikari attempts to make a spell in the heat of the moment, before failing and losing focus. Panicking, she keeps to the train car while holding the staff to her person.
[16-Feb-2014 00:47:44]  <Rig> "Hikari, find Minami. You can take her. Let me handle our new friend," Jun calls out as she attempts to turn her disadvantaged position into a sloppy judo throw.
[16-Feb-2014 00:48:04]  <Rig> Does that count as showing care enough to roll for my 3d6 trait?
[16-Feb-2014 00:48:42]  <IllFlower> I thought that was more for talking suicidal folks back from the brink.

[16-Feb-2014 00:49:00]  <Rig> That's my raise.
[16-Feb-2014 00:49:08]  <IllFlower> 4.
[16-Feb-2014 00:49:11]  <Alicia> 4?
[16-Feb-2014 00:49:14]  <Rig> It's a shit throw.
[16-Feb-2014 00:49:20]  <IllFlower> Who against?
[16-Feb-2014 00:49:23]  <Rig> New girl.
[16-Feb-2014 00:50:04]  <Rig> Alicia: I used one of my dice to help you. So I can only raise with one.
[16-Feb-2014 00:50:12]  <Rig> Which sucks because everything will be reversed.
[16-Feb-2014 00:50:14]  <ponicalica> Which dice are IllFlower's and which ones are the ones he has written down
[16-Feb-2014 00:50:17]  <Alicia> Aah, right. Ack.
[16-Feb-2014 00:50:21]  <IllFlower> New girl is the bank.
[16-Feb-2014 00:50:30]  <IllFlower> Minami has 11112233445666.
[16-Feb-2014 00:50:38]  <Alicia> So sorry, Jun.
[16-Feb-2014 00:51:03]  <ponicalica> Jun and Hikari are kind of screwed, aren't they
[16-Feb-2014 00:51:18]  <IllFlower> The new girl easily sidesteps Jun's grasp, and flips backward into the air over her.
[16-Feb-2014 00:51:23]  <IllFlower> @dice use 4

[16-Feb-2014 00:52:29]  <IllFlower> I'll break order if that's all right. I figure the new girl should go next.
[16-Feb-2014 00:52:52]  <Rig> Yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 00:53:13]  <Alicia> The girls, being magical, can have some vague idea of where the two are hiding right? Right now I'm just imagining Hikari going blindly (well, yeah) in whatever direction.
[16-Feb-2014 00:53:16]  <Alicia> And yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 00:53:29]  <IllFlower> Alicia: You can play that as part of the conflict.
[16-Feb-2014 00:54:10]  <Alicia> Mhm.
[16-Feb-2014 00:54:52]  <IllFlower> The stranger lands solidly on her feet behind Jun.
[16-Feb-2014 00:55:11]  <IllFlower> Jun hears a cracking sound around her. Her chest suddenly feels quite tight...
[16-Feb-2014 00:55:22]  <IllFlower> I'm going to assign the 1d10 to space manipulation.
[16-Feb-2014 00:55:38]  <IllFlower> @dice add 1d10

[16-Feb-2014 00:55:55]  <Barcode> "it was because one of her kendo pads was too tight!" raise 3.
[16-Feb-2014 00:55:56]  <ponicalica> they're both possessed, actually

[16-Feb-2014 00:56:18]  <ponicalica> Ayako really probably should have protested more when Jun split up the gang.

[16-Feb-2014 00:57:17]  <Barcode> he's fine, he'll just have to overdo it on the see
[16-Feb-2014 00:57:24]  <Barcode> or at least, he's fine in a "this roll" sense `-`
[16-Feb-2014 00:57:34]  <Alicia> Is the demon comfortably at bay? Like, can Ayako jump in.
[16-Feb-2014 00:57:44]  <ponicalica> Alicia: Ayako can't jump into a running conflict, I think
[16-Feb-2014 00:57:46]  <Alicia> Or, not demon, I forget.
[16-Feb-2014 00:57:49]  <Alicia> Ah.
[16-Feb-2014 00:57:52]  <IllFlower> Ayako can't be anything more than her relationship dice at this point.
[16-Feb-2014 00:57:53]  <ponicalica> except as, like, 1d8
[16-Feb-2014 00:58:40]  <Alicia> Mm.
[16-Feb-2014 00:59:09]  <Rig> Not sure what's a good see against some invisible space magic.
[16-Feb-2014 00:59:24]  <Rig> Breaking the girl's concentration?
[16-Feb-2014 00:59:27]  <IllFlower> Rig: Just dodge out of the way. She's basically trying to crush your torso.
[16-Feb-2014 00:59:41]  <IllFlower> Well, Jun's torso.
[16-Feb-2014 00:59:55]  <IllFlower> It's point magic so if you're not in the radius it doesn't do much.
[16-Feb-2014 01:01:13]  <Rig> Jun feels the pulse of magic again, this time from the new girl and rolls backward. A sharp cracking noise rings out as the air is displaced by sudden compression.

[16-Feb-2014 01:04:13]  <Barcode> does someone have a relationship with ayako or whatever? you could have her use some spare energy to artillery into the bubble, maybe?
[16-Feb-2014 01:04:28]  <Alicia> Jun does.
[16-Feb-2014 01:04:30]  <IllFlower> Minami takes another knife and throws it directly at Hikari's chest.

[16-Feb-2014 01:05:03]  <ponicalica> Alicia: have you used your staff yet in this battle?
[16-Feb-2014 01:05:20]  <Rig> She rolled it a while back I think.
[16-Feb-2014 01:05:26]  <IllFlower> She did.
[16-Feb-2014 01:05:27]  <Alicia> I know I've held it, but uh. I forget if I've added it. I think?
[16-Feb-2014 01:05:31]  <Alicia> Okay, yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 01:06:25]  <IllFlower> Okay, I changed the character sheet to strike out stuff we've already used in the current battle.
[16-Feb-2014 01:06:30]  <IllFlower> We can reset that later.
[16-Feb-2014 01:06:40]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 01:08:05]  <Alicia> Well, uhm.
[16-Feb-2014 01:09:19]  <Alicia> Best is 65, which means I'm still getting hit. I think?
[16-Feb-2014 01:09:39]  <Alicia> After that I've got one 5, but I mean, I don't think dying to that is a good idea.
[16-Feb-2014 01:09:40]  <IllFlower> Jun may be able to help Hikari again. Jun's raise will be weak, but at least with the number of 6s she has I don't think she'll take fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 01:10:05]  <Rig> Is this second knife magical too?
[16-Feb-2014 01:10:25]  <Rig> Doesn't matter, weapons from Minami are d10 fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 01:10:28]  <IllFlower> I'm just assuming everything is magical now.
[16-Feb-2014 01:10:57]  <Rig> I can help with another 1 and you can still see?
[16-Feb-2014 01:11:03]  <Barcode> tracer knives.
[16-Feb-2014 01:11:14]  <Barcode> ("that's what the flint was for")
[16-Feb-2014 01:11:46]  <Alicia> I stand for justice. Roll a -1.
[16-Feb-2014 01:12:08]  <Rig> Jun's magical senses are getting a workout as yet another burst of magic comes from Minami's direction. She shoves out a shield and get's lucky enough to deflect the knife a little.

[16-Feb-2014 01:13:34]  <Rig> I would put in a higher help, but it's hard to block a knife based on magical senses in all this smoke.
[16-Feb-2014 01:13:36]  <ponicalica> 53 isn't a bad raise though, unless Minami or the other girl have 8s
[16-Feb-2014 01:13:48]  <Barcode> oh, yeah, i don't mean "do differently"
[16-Feb-2014 01:13:57]  <Barcode> if anything just "lol alicia's getting bailed out a lot"
[16-Feb-2014 01:14:04]  <Alicia> Sorry. ;_;
[16-Feb-2014 01:14:10]  <Barcode> it ain't your fault or anything.
[16-Feb-2014 01:14:10]  <Rig> It fits Jun's character.
[16-Feb-2014 01:14:30]  <ponicalica> bad luck is bad luck

[16-Feb-2014 01:16:22]  <IllFlower> What's she do?
[16-Feb-2014 01:16:48]  <Rig> You could also make a speech about justice.
[16-Feb-2014 01:17:01]  <IllFlower> What is this, a sentai show?
[16-Feb-2014 01:17:03]  <ponicalica> Minami is so moved she moves
[16-Feb-2014 01:17:14]  <Alicia> It sucks. I roll a -69.
[16-Feb-2014 01:17:45]  <IllFlower> I'm just wondering, it seems like you're raising 3 5 here.
[16-Feb-2014 01:17:56]  <Barcode> Alicia: be loud, get mad about knives! swing your damn polearm thing
[16-Feb-2014 01:17:58]  <Alicia> That's as high as I can go, isn't it?
[16-Feb-2014 01:18:00]  <Barcode> yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 01:18:07]  <Barcode> you dont' have to be not out of breath but just make it big.
[16-Feb-2014 01:18:08]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but you have to describe what's going on.
[16-Feb-2014 01:18:16]  <Barcode> and yeah describing what happens is important.
[16-Feb-2014 01:18:16]  <IllFlower> Or at least say who the raise is against.
[16-Feb-2014 01:18:24]  <Barcode> that too
[16-Feb-2014 01:18:35]  <Alicia> Well she was going Minami's way, presumably she's nearly there.
[16-Feb-2014 01:18:41]  <Alicia> Or. Something.
[16-Feb-2014 01:19:05]  <Barcode> okay! so what does she do to[wards] minami

[16-Feb-2014 01:19:26]  <IllFlower> She could trace the trajectory of the knife and direct some kind of blast of magic in that direction.
[16-Feb-2014 01:19:33]  <Rig> Turns the staff into a magical beam rifle.
[16-Feb-2014 01:19:41]  <IllFlower> Always a good option.
[16-Feb-2014 01:19:49]  <Alicia> I could also roll 1d6 for believing that she's still under there somehow.
[16-Feb-2014 01:19:58]  <Alicia> But, 1d6...
[16-Feb-2014 01:20:15]  <IllFlower> Again I think it's a bit late to be trying emotional appeals. :p
[16-Feb-2014 01:20:27]  <Barcode> yeah those were some killing blows.
[16-Feb-2014 01:20:40]  <Alicia> Good point, I was just thinking internally or something. But no yeah, killing blows.
[16-Feb-2014 01:20:50]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: going full anime
[16-Feb-2014 01:21:04]  <IllFlower> You never go full anime!
[16-Feb-2014 01:21:26]  <Barcode> hiiragi gets a super gritty closeup
[16-Feb-2014 01:21:37]  <Barcode> seriously, do something cool with the staff.
[16-Feb-2014 01:21:38]  <Rig> Technically, you could call out to Ayako for help.
[16-Feb-2014 01:21:53]  <Barcode> like, to raise stronger?
[16-Feb-2014 01:22:00]  <Rig> Yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 01:22:06]  <Rig> "Ayako, help me find Minami"
[16-Feb-2014 01:22:13]  <Barcode> you know you want that magical killsat - oh.
[16-Feb-2014 01:22:21]  <Rig> I do want magical killsats.
[16-Feb-2014 01:22:32]  <IllFlower> Or just some kind of area bombardment.
[16-Feb-2014 01:22:41]  <Rig> I think Ayako counts as a 1d8 being an emgirl.
[16-Feb-2014 01:22:48]  <Alicia> Yeah, I wa thinking ask for Ayako, hope it pans out, and then do a thing with the staff.
[16-Feb-2014 01:22:50]  <ponicalica> I thought 1d8 was for "big"
[16-Feb-2014 01:22:52]  <Barcode> IllFlower:  well, killsats have to do that cool laser-triangulation thing, if this is gears of war
[16-Feb-2014 01:22:55]  <ponicalica> and 2d6 for "awesome"
[16-Feb-2014 01:23:02]  <Rig> Do you think Ayako is awesome?
[16-Feb-2014 01:23:10]  <Barcode> so she'd have time to dodge.
[16-Feb-2014 01:23:11]  <Nitya> 14killsats? clearly i should pay more attention to this mgirls game

[16-Feb-2014 01:23:22]  <Rig> I wanted to orbit drop.
[16-Feb-2014 01:23:27]  <ponicalica> Rig: I think the question is "does Hikari think Ayako is awesome"
[16-Feb-2014 01:23:37]  <Alicia> Well duh.
[16-Feb-2014 01:24:03]  <Rig> We should probably mov along though.
[16-Feb-2014 01:24:12]  <Rig> It is now an hour and a half since I said I would eat dinner.
[16-Feb-2014 01:24:19]  <IllFlower> So Hikari raises 3 5?
[16-Feb-2014 01:24:23]  <Alicia> Yes.
[16-Feb-2014 01:24:43]  <Rig> Fires an embeam along the path of the knife, still visible in the smoke.
[16-Feb-2014 01:24:48]  <IllFlower> That's what I said!
[16-Feb-2014 01:24:53]  <IllFlower> I'll pretend that's what happened.
[16-Feb-2014 01:25:13]  <Alicia> Hikari edges out of the way, drawing in on Minami. Clutching her staff, she launches alaser towards where the knife came from.
[16-Feb-2014 01:25:23]  <IllFlower> Minami spots the light of the charging beam and realizes that she's been spotted. She jumps out of the train car where she's been hiding right before it explodes into smithereens.

[16-Feb-2014 01:26:26]  <Rig> Does using a train car as a bludgeon count as dumb, dangerous, or desperate?
[16-Feb-2014 01:26:26]  <IllFlower> Rig has a lot of 6s, so he has a chance to do some damage.

[16-Feb-2014 01:29:19]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 01:29:27]  <Barcode> you have a 1 in 4 chance (like the 2 in 8 chance).
[16-Feb-2014 01:29:38]  <Barcode> at any rate i think IF is attacking/seeing now?
[16-Feb-2014 01:29:54]  <IllFlower> No, Rig is.
[16-Feb-2014 01:30:00]  <IllFlower> Raising.
[16-Feb-2014 01:30:33]  <Rig> "Ayako, can you do something about this smoke? Purify it or something?" Jun calls out as she jumps on to of the nearest train car. Ayako flips through her notebook rapidly coming up with a single spell for exorcism scrawled hastily in the margins. "Conflare Lustravi," she intones. For a brief moment the air around Jun clears and she has a line of sight on the new girl.
[16-Feb-2014 01:30:47]  <Rig> (Do I throw out a cheesy one-liner before I wreck this shit?)

[16-Feb-2014 01:31:34]  <Barcode> worth a shot.
[16-Feb-2014 01:32:32]  <Rig> "The train is now departing." Jun pools her magic around the train car she's on top of. "Watch your step." She blasts the boxcar towards the girl while she backflips away.

[16-Feb-2014 01:33:36]  <ponicalica> Nah, if you have a relationship it automatically uses those dice.
[16-Feb-2014 01:33:43]  <Rig> And the relationship is 1d6.
[16-Feb-2014 01:34:07]  <ponicalica> oh right I'm thinking the other way around :V

[16-Feb-2014 01:41:23]  <Alicia> We gonna die.
[16-Feb-2014 01:41:28]  <IllFlower> The new girl uses Minami's cover to dodge around to the side.
[16-Feb-2014 01:41:29]  <BGTB2005> good luck
[16-Feb-2014 01:41:30]  <Rig> I really want her to launch it back at Jun.
[16-Feb-2014 01:41:35]  <IllFlower> Raise 6 6 as earlier.
[16-Feb-2014 01:41:39]  <IllFlower> Er, sorry, see 6 6.
[16-Feb-2014 01:41:43]  <IllFlower> Now I have to raise.
[16-Feb-2014 01:41:48]  <Rig> 6 4?
[16-Feb-2014 01:42:26]  <IllFlower> There's another cracking sound as the space between the train car and Jun begins to compress to a point. Better get out of the way...
[16-Feb-2014 01:42:30]  <IllFlower> @dice use 4

[16-Feb-2014 01:45:15]  <Alicia> It was nice playing Hikari.
[16-Feb-2014 01:45:20]  <IllFlower> I've said this before, but the Guilty Crown soundtrack really does go great with these battles.
[16-Feb-2014 01:47:02]  <Rig> Jun claps her hands in front of her and crushes the train car into a ball with a sphere of magical energy. The sphere fades and Jun spreads her arms wide as another sphere rapidly expands from the center of the ball. The stressed metal explodes into shards. The compression pulls them towards Jun still, but now she can move through the maelstrom of metal. She deflects the larger chunks and ignores the pain of the smaller sliv
[16-Feb-2014 01:47:02]  <Rig> slashing ribbons into her armor and skin. Finally, the metal settles and the black fog begins to creep back in around Jun and the new girl. "I'm going to kill you," Jun says, staring down the possessed girl as blood drips down her fingers.
[16-Feb-2014 01:47:07]  <Rig> Hope that all went through.

[16-Feb-2014 01:48:24]  <IllFlower> It's Minami's raise now.
[16-Feb-2014 01:48:36]  <Rig> Jun's probably going to die or get taken hostage by the bad girls.
[16-Feb-2014 01:48:49]  <IllFlower> Nah, I decided against hostage-taking.
[16-Feb-2014 01:48:53]  <Rig> Nice.
[16-Feb-2014 01:48:57]  <IllFlower> Splits up the group, you see.
[16-Feb-2014 01:49:01]  <Alicia> So we're just going to die.
[16-Feb-2014 01:49:05]  <IllFlower> Also they don't have much of a reason to do so.
[16-Feb-2014 01:50:14]  <Barcode> gotta go. gl
[16-Feb-2014 01:50:16]  <IllFlower> Minami, having used up most of her magic just to protect her companion, goes for brute force instead. She comes up behind Hikari and levels off a strong kick.

[16-Feb-2014 01:52:00]  <Alicia> those*
[16-Feb-2014 01:52:00]  <Rig> You can handle a 5.
[16-Feb-2014 01:52:22]  <Alicia> Yeah. So I raise 23?
[16-Feb-2014 01:52:26]  <IllFlower> See 23.
[16-Feb-2014 01:52:27]  <Rig> See 2 3, yes.
[16-Feb-2014 01:52:31]  <Alicia> See*. >_<

[16-Feb-2014 01:52:39]  <Rig> Or you could give and beg IllFlower to let you escape.
[16-Feb-2014 01:53:30]  <Saladofstones> once the omnidice train starts
[16-Feb-2014 01:53:32]  <IllFlower> Okay, Rig, you've still got the most 6s, so you're up.
[16-Feb-2014 01:53:34]  <Saladofstones> it don't stop until it hits the end
[16-Feb-2014 01:53:51]  <Rig> Did everyone raise?
[16-Feb-2014 01:53:56]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:00]  <IllFlower> You, me, me again, Alicia.
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:12]  <Alicia> Can I roll a 2d6 (diamond ring) to, well, use in combat. For pain.
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:13]  *** MobileAvenue <~CentralAv@cpe-65-24-227-116.insight.res.rr.com> has joined #madokamadness
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:16]  <Rig> I don't remember Alica going?
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:29]  <IllFlower> Oh, right, she hasn't raised yet. My mistake.
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:38]  <Alicia> @dice use 2 3
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:39]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Used 2 3 = 5. Bank now has 2 2 = 4.
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:42]  <IllFlower> In that case, Alicia, your raise.
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:46]  <Rig> "Punches Minami right in the face with a diamond ring!"
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:53]  <ponicalica> sounds like a good plan to me
[16-Feb-2014 01:54:53]  <IllFlower> Alicia: 2 3 for the raise as well?
[16-Feb-2014 01:55:02]  <Alicia> Oh, wait, can I roll the 2d6?
[16-Feb-2014 01:55:15]  <IllFlower> If you can justify it.
[16-Feb-2014 01:55:59]  <Alicia> Well we're in hand-to-hand combat and Hikari is desperate, so I think anything that can hurt makes sense.
[16-Feb-2014 01:56:27]  <IllFlower> Put the ring on and try to leave a ring-shaped imprint on Minami's face?
[16-Feb-2014 01:56:32]  <Alicia> Yes.
[16-Feb-2014 01:56:41]  <IllFlower> Diamond brass knuckles.
[16-Feb-2014 01:56:52]  <Alicia> @dice add 2d6
[16-Feb-2014 01:56:52]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Rolled 1 4 = 5. Bank now has 1 2 2 4 = 9.
[16-Feb-2014 01:57:02]  <ponicalica> if you want to use either of those add your 2 3 back
[16-Feb-2014 01:57:21]  <Alicia> 14... Eesh.
[16-Feb-2014 01:57:45]  <Alicia> @dice add 2 3
[16-Feb-2014 01:57:45]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Rolled 2 3 = 5. Bank now has 1 2 2 2 3 4 = 14.
[16-Feb-2014 01:57:52]  <Rig> IllFlower: I've actually been listening to various Daft Punk for the last couple conflicts.
[16-Feb-2014 01:58:02]  <IllFlower> You can at least raise 7, which prevents Minami from reversing your blow with a 6.
[16-Feb-2014 01:58:10]  <IllFlower> She has 111122336, as a reminder.
[16-Feb-2014 01:58:29]  <Alicia> @dice use 4 3
[16-Feb-2014 01:58:29]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Used 3 4 = 7. Bank now has 1 2 2 2 = 7.
[16-Feb-2014 01:58:38]  <Rig> So, Minami's turn to see.
[16-Feb-2014 01:58:40]  <IllFlower> Rig: "around the world... of death"
[16-Feb-2014 01:58:47]  <Rig> Pretty much.
[16-Feb-2014 01:59:47]  <Alicia> Gasping for air, Hikari promptly turns around and punches Minami in the mouth with her ring.
[16-Feb-2014 02:00:36]  <Alicia> I'm trying. ._.
[16-Feb-2014 02:01:10]  <IllFlower> The punch catches Minami, who is still recovering from her missed jump, off guard. The ring leaves a sharp cut on her face. See 322, leave 1111336, 3d8 fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 02:01:33]  <Rig> Jun's raise?
[16-Feb-2014 02:01:38]  <Rig> @dice
[16-Feb-2014 02:01:38]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Bank has 1 6 6 = 13.
[16-Feb-2014 02:01:41]  <IllFlower> Yeah, now it's Jun's go.

[16-Feb-2014 02:01:48]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Bank has 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 = 27.
[16-Feb-2014 02:03:03]  <Alicia> Is 3d8 fallout serious.
[16-Feb-2014 02:03:05]  <IllFlower> This conflict would essentially be over were it not for that second 6, haha.
[16-Feb-2014 02:03:12]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Possibility of death.
[16-Feb-2014 02:03:22]  <Alicia> Oh.
[16-Feb-2014 02:03:28]  <Alicia> Least I did something...
[16-Feb-2014 02:04:02]  <ponicalica> Are we going to end up having the new girl do medic for Minami while Ayako does it for either Jun or Hikari?
[16-Feb-2014 02:04:19]  <IllFlower> Depends on whom the dice hate.
[16-Feb-2014 02:04:31]  <Rig> IllFlower: Can I add two relationships?
[16-Feb-2014 02:04:41]  <IllFlower> With?
[16-Feb-2014 02:04:56]  <Rig> One with the new girl and one with Aki.
[16-Feb-2014 02:05:21]  <Alicia> With the newbie?
[16-Feb-2014 02:05:31]  <Rig> Yeah. I can justify it.
[16-Feb-2014 02:05:49]  <IllFlower> The former's okay. The latter you can technically do but I question its relevance to the immediate conflict.
[16-Feb-2014 02:05:49]  <Alicia> Mm.
[16-Feb-2014 02:06:02]  <Rig> Okay, just gonna do the new girl.
[16-Feb-2014 02:06:29]  <Rig> "You are a monster. You and that other girl. You attacked Aki. You killed Sanae." Jun says as she approaches with slow, methodical steps. The gravel crunches beneath her feet. "I am going to kill you. Then I'm going to kill Minami. And then I'm going to hunt down Kotomi and kill her too." Jun stretches out one arm; her hand open like a claw pointed at the new girl.
[16-Feb-2014 02:06:37]  <Rig> @dice add d10
[16-Feb-2014 02:06:37]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Rolled 3 = 3. Bank now has 1 3 6 6 = 16.

[16-Feb-2014 02:06:43]  <IllFlower> Eh.
[16-Feb-2014 02:06:44]  <ponicalica> ...ouch
[16-Feb-2014 02:06:58]  <Alicia> OWW.
[16-Feb-2014 02:07:01]  <Alicia> Oww*
[16-Feb-2014 02:07:22]  <Rig> Jun growls, "I want to thank you though. Know I know you can't be saved." She closed her hand and a band of purple light wraps around the girl's neck and tightens.
[16-Feb-2014 02:07:27]  <Rig> @dice use 6 6
[16-Feb-2014 02:07:27]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Used 6 6 = 12. Bank now has 1 3 = 4.

[16-Feb-2014 02:07:44]  <Rig> Fuck my typing
[16-Feb-2014 02:07:52]  <ponicalica> and Jun's letting her aggression out.
[16-Feb-2014 02:08:01]  <Alicia> Just realized we don't even know the newbie's name. Ouch.
[16-Feb-2014 02:08:06]  <IllFlower> I never rolled Minami's 3d8 for her relationship with the witches.
[16-Feb-2014 02:08:11]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[16-Feb-2014 02:08:13]  <Alicia> ._.

[16-Feb-2014 02:08:28]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Bank has 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 = 27.
[16-Feb-2014 02:08:30]  <Alicia> She. She forgot.
[16-Feb-2014 02:08:54]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: The witches were clearly on the other side of the barrier
[16-Feb-2014 02:08:58]  <ponicalica> didn't even know what was going on
[16-Feb-2014 02:09:02]  <IllFlower> I was thinking "it's not at stake" but I just remembered she has Viciousness.
[16-Feb-2014 02:09:12]  <Alicia> Viciousness?
[16-Feb-2014 02:09:53]  <IllFlower> Blood begins to appear around the new girl's neck as the light cuts ever further into her skin.
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:02]  <IllFlower> @dice use 3 3 3 3
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:02]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 3 3 3 3 = 12. Bank now has 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 = 15.
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:06]  <IllFlower> Take 4d8 fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:11]  <Rig> d10 for magic?
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:14]  <ponicalica> d8?  Is this not magical fallout?
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:22]  <Alicia> How does this rank compared to the 3d8 fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:34]  <Alicia> "Really bad" to "Super really bad"?
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:36]  <IllFlower> She has Preservation.
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:41]  <Rig> Ah, right.
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:53]  <ponicalica> Preservation reduces dice count
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:54]  <ponicalica> not size
[16-Feb-2014 02:10:55]  <IllFlower> Oh, sorry, should be 3d10, not 4d8.
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:06]  <IllFlower> All these inconsistent rules!
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:07]  <Alicia> Ah. Question stands.
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:13]  <IllFlower> Worse.
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:18]  <Alicia> Mm.
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:21]  <IllFlower> Possibility of dying without any recourse.
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:32]  <IllFlower> I do believe it's Minami's turn, though.
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:32]  <Rig> Though Jun took 4d10 fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:38]  <IllFlower> Time to roll that 3d8.
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:41]  <Rig> Jun is almost certainly dead.
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:43]  <IllFlower> @dice add 3d8
[16-Feb-2014 02:11:43]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 2 2 4 = 8. Bank now has 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 4 = 23.

[16-Feb-2014 02:12:04]  <ponicalica> small comfort
[16-Feb-2014 02:12:14]  <IllFlower> Add 224 yielding 1111223346.
[16-Feb-2014 02:13:44]  <IllFlower> Minami sees her comrade begin to yield to the effects of Jun's lethal magic, and decides it's time to abandon finesse now that her only ally is likely a goner.
[16-Feb-2014 02:13:56]  <Alicia> Oh no.
[16-Feb-2014 02:15:47]  <IllFlower> "Tempestas cultrorum," she shouts, and a hail of knives appears in the air, dropping down to cut anyone and everyone in its way.
[16-Feb-2014 02:15:47]  <Alicia> Bye Hikari. ;_;
[16-Feb-2014 02:16:05]  <IllFlower> Raise 46 leaving 11112233.

[16-Feb-2014 02:17:34]  <Alicia> We all gon die.
[16-Feb-2014 02:17:59]  <Rig> Jun's magic fades and her costume falls apart. She falls to her knees as the knives rain down around her. "Sorry, mom. I won't be making it home tonight."
[16-Feb-2014 02:18:01]  <Rig> Jun gives.
[16-Feb-2014 02:18:05]  <ponicalica> ;_;

[16-Feb-2014 02:18:37]  <Alicia> :(
[16-Feb-2014 02:19:08]  <IllFlower> I'm going to take fallout before deciding whether the antagonists are actually going to go through with killing Jun and Hikari.
[16-Feb-2014 02:19:21]  <Rig> @dice roll 4d10
[16-Feb-2014 02:19:21]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Rolled 3 8 10 10 = 31.

[16-Feb-2014 02:19:41]  <IllFlower> Hikari can't see, so I assume she gives.
[16-Feb-2014 02:19:42]  <ponicalica> it's the top 2
[16-Feb-2014 02:19:49]  <IllFlower> She has no fallout, though.
[16-Feb-2014 02:19:52]  <ponicalica> which are 20.  the maximum.

[16-Feb-2014 02:21:37]  <IllFlower> Okay, I'm going to call them both dead. Hikari makes it.
[16-Feb-2014 02:21:40]  <Rig> Hikari and Ayako live.
[16-Feb-2014 02:21:58]  <Rig> I'm satisfied with Jun's death scene. ^_^
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:03]  <IllFlower> And we never even learned the new girl's name.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:04]  <ponicalica> Ayako's going to be very sad when she hears the news
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:11]  <Alicia> Wait, which dice roll is Hikari's?
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:17]  <ponicalica> Alicia: None of them.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:18]  <Rig> Damn, IllFlower. This was excellent.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:20]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Hikari didn't take any fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:21]  <Alicia> .... oh.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:29]  <Rig> Jun always saved her from taking fallout.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:31]  <IllFlower> This was a lot of fun.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:36]  <Rig> So much fun.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:37]  <Alicia> Sheet.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:39]  <ponicalica> It was.  Even though Ayako was on the sidelines.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:39]  <Alicia> ;_;
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:44]  <IllFlower> Well, you can have some dying words.
[16-Feb-2014 02:22:51]  <Rig> I liked the ones I used already.
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:07]  <Alicia> I think Hikari is, uh. Kinda traumatized.
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:16]  <Rig> Almost certainly.
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:22]  <Rig> But damn.
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:22]  <Alicia> Eeeeeyeaaah.
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:22]  <IllFlower> "Kinda."
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:24]  <Rig> That was fun.
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:38]  <BGTB2005> mission accomplished?
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:39]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Kinda is a personal tic, kind of.
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:41]  <Rig> That is the most fun losing a fight that I've ever had, IllFlower.
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:42]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: well, they died
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:44]  <ponicalica> Alicia: litotes
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:53]  <IllFlower> Rig: Glad you enjoyed it.
[16-Feb-2014 02:23:59]  <Alicia> Yeah that's basically me at times ponicalica.

[16-Feb-2014 02:24:04]  <Rig> Are we calling it the end of a session here?
[16-Feb-2014 02:24:12]  <SpruceZeus> hello friends i am here
[16-Feb-2014 02:24:19]  <IllFlower> Anything for Hikari to say to Ayako?
[16-Feb-2014 02:24:28]  <ponicalica> SpruceZeus: still megucing
[16-Feb-2014 02:24:30]  <IllFlower> We can clean up the debris and finish.
[16-Feb-2014 02:24:33]  <Rig> SpruceZeus: Yo, just wrapping up a session where everyone died.
[16-Feb-2014 02:24:43]  <Alicia> IllFlower: The two witches are dead, right?
[16-Feb-2014 02:24:45]  <ponicalica> Rig: I'm thinking about a eulogy-type thing, maybe

[16-Feb-2014 02:24:49]  <ponicalica> Alicia: the two possessed girls are
[16-Feb-2014 02:24:51]  <Alicia> Er, not witches, but.
[16-Feb-2014 02:24:53]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 02:24:54]  <IllFlower> Alicia: The two other girls are dead, yes.
[16-Feb-2014 02:25:04]  <Rig> SpruceZeus: Pretty accurate.
[16-Feb-2014 02:25:51]  <Rig> SpruceZeus: http://pastebin.com/xBqpK5dF If you're interested.

[16-Feb-2014 02:25:53]  <IllFlower> Minami and the girl you never even learned the name of before she died.
[16-Feb-2014 02:26:06]  <Rig> We have no leads.
[16-Feb-2014 02:26:17]  <Alicia> Hikari scans the area of destruction, body cold and numb, as she walks over to Jun. She falls to her knees, mouth gaping open for words that won't come, before breaking down over the deceased girl.
[16-Feb-2014 02:26:45]  <SpruceZeus> Rig: rip in peace
[16-Feb-2014 02:26:53]  <IllFlower> The black fog dispels from inside the dome, giving Ayako a clear view, for the first time, of the utter devastation.
[16-Feb-2014 02:26:56]  <SpruceZeus> Rig: jun was your character, yeah?
[16-Feb-2014 02:26:59]  <Rig> Yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 02:27:00]  <ponicalica> SpruceZeus: yes
[16-Feb-2014 02:27:13]  <SpruceZeus> <SpruceZeus>	Rig: rip in peace
[16-Feb-2014 02:27:43]  <SpruceZeus> may flights of tiny chibi madokamis sing you to your rest
[16-Feb-2014 02:27:48]  <Rig> Heheh.
[16-Feb-2014 02:27:57]  <IllFlower> Shredded train cars are strewn around the outside of small craters. Fires burn beneath some of their skeletons. Knives litter the ground.
[16-Feb-2014 02:28:31]  <IllFlower> Ayako sees Hikari slumped in tears over Jun's dead body. Her mind goes blank.
[16-Feb-2014 02:29:21]  *** CentralAve <~CentralAv@cpe-65-24-227-116.insight.res.rr.com> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 201 seconds)
[16-Feb-2014 02:29:48]  <IllFlower> Do you guys just want me to narrate this to the end?
[16-Feb-2014 02:30:06]  <Rig> Yeah.
[16-Feb-2014 02:30:07]  <ponicalica> I want to say a thing or two, at least
[16-Feb-2014 02:30:15]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Shoot.
[16-Feb-2014 02:31:55]  <Alicia> (And yeah, IllFlower, Hikari's not really even able to speak right now, sooo yeah.)
[16-Feb-2014 02:33:12]  <IllFlower> Yeah, I'll let ponicalica play Ayako's reaction, and then we should be finished.
[16-Feb-2014 02:33:43]  <ponicalica> it actually goes right before the last line: Ayako scans the wreckage and sees the dying, beyond saving, bodies of the assailants.  Even then she begins the Conservator funerary chants: "Ceteris nescientibus in memoriam perpetuam; malo animo bonam vid--" She cuts herself short unconsciously when she sees Hikari slumped in tears over Jun's dead body.
[16-Feb-2014 02:34:24]  <IllFlower> Nice touch.
[16-Feb-2014 02:34:31]  <IllFlower> Anything after that?
[16-Feb-2014 02:35:40]  <ponicalica> Nah.
[16-Feb-2014 02:36:13]  <ponicalica> I think both Ayako and Hikari are gonna need some reassuring words from Shii though, haha.
[16-Feb-2014 02:37:10]  <ponicalica> Therapy, maybe.
[16-Feb-2014 02:37:37]  <Alicia> Both.
[16-Feb-2014 02:39:13]  <IllFlower> The sound of sirens seems to creep above the horizon together with the morning sun, laying bare the wasteland that this place has become.
[16-Feb-2014 02:39:30]  <IllFlower> That's all for today. Thanks for sticking around for another long session, everyone.
[16-Feb-2014 02:39:33]  * IllFlower salutes
[16-Feb-2014 02:39:36]  <Alicia> ;_;
