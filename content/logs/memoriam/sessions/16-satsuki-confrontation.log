@time=2014-03-29T20:46:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She twists the key counterclockwise, at which the mechanism pops open with a snapping sound.

@time=2014-03-30T02:11:34.000Z :Omnipresence PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14IllFlower: Bank cleared.
@time=2014-03-30T02:12:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari looks at the Ayako's unconscious body, then at the satisfied smile on Osada's face, anger pulsing through her veins. "I can't believe you, you..." Hikari clears the path to Osada, slamming her staff down on top of her.
@time=2014-03-30T02:13:38.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So Hikari avoided fallout, right?
@time=2014-03-30T02:14:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Satsuki rolls out of the way, I guess. There go my last dice.
@time=2014-03-30T02:14:49.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And now let's see how bad Ayako's gonna end up?
@time=2014-03-30T02:14:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She raises her hands in the air. "I know when I've been outmatched."
@time=2014-03-30T02:14:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Roll fallout.
@time=2014-03-30T02:15:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :@dice roll 3d8

@time=2014-03-30T02:15:51.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So is that one long-term item?
@time=2014-03-30T02:15:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Here's a 10, there's a 10, everywhere a 10, 10.

@time=2014-03-30T02:16:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's one long-term item.
@time=2014-03-30T02:17:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Gonna knock down Satsuki's Bd stat, not that it's likely to ever be relevant again...
@time=2014-03-30T02:18:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I could see Ayako having some issues with taking charge in the future. Got her pretty beat up here.
@time=2014-03-30T02:18:50.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari swallows, looking daggers down at Osada. She searches for what to say to her, though nothing comes to mind.
@time=2014-03-30T02:19:19.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That makes sense.  Either that or bump her "doesn't run from violence" from a d6 to a d4, considering its effects on her this time around.  But I think I'm going to give myself a little time to think about it, at least
@time=2014-03-30T02:19:28.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :s/foo/bar/ means "replace foo with bar in this text" <~~~ Thanks, Nitya.

@time=2014-03-30T02:24:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I underestimated you," Satsuki says through bloodied lips.
@time=2014-03-30T02:25:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She smiles that same enigmatic smile.
@time=2014-03-30T02:26:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The worst part is that I can tell I was only a hair's breadth away from victory."
@time=2014-03-30T02:27:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Satsuki sighs. "Let your justice have its way with me. There's nothing else I can do."
@time=2014-03-30T02:30:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Any parting shots?
@time=2014-03-30T02:30:55.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not from this direction.
@time=2014-03-30T02:30:57.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari sighs, the energy leaving her system. "We will." She mutters quietly, before knocking her out with the staff. 
@time=2014-03-30T02:31:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You might not want to do that. Ayako's injured and Satsuki's not exactly portable...
@time=2014-03-30T02:32:10.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm imagining, like, Hikari dragging a pair of girls out of the place
@time=2014-03-30T02:32:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, admittedly, it does fit Hikari's character.
@time=2014-03-30T02:32:37.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I figured, like, she's out of action until Hikari knows Ayako can at least function after passing out.
@time=2014-03-30T02:32:54.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Although that too. ;p
@time=2014-03-30T02:32:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was thinking Ayako might even have to hold her back from just killing Satsuki.
@time=2014-03-30T02:33:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But just knocking her unconscious seems like a bad idea. It's not like she has the strength to put up much of a struggle anyway.
@time=2014-03-30T02:33:44.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari wants to, but has principles. These principles are being strained as it is, granted.
@time=2014-03-30T02:33:47.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Point.
@time=2014-03-30T02:34:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And remember how you got in here? By ladder!
@time=2014-03-30T02:34:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, anyway, I think this is a nice place to close.
@time=2014-03-30T02:35:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shall we consider this branch's problems solved for now?
@time=2014-03-30T02:35:05.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah. Details will be dealt with after.
@time=2014-03-30T02:35:17.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Either way, a certain someone is getting cuffed just in case. `-`
@time=2014-03-30T02:35:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What is it with you and your handcuffs?
@time=2014-03-30T02:35:39.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Angrily cuffed, because she can't killllll blargh.
@time=2014-03-30T02:35:46.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I HAVE NO SUCH THING, DARN IT.
@time=2014-03-30T02:35:49.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she keeps 'em just in case of a bondage emergency, I thought we already went over this
@time=2014-03-30T02:36:11.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's proper procedure with criminals!
@time=2014-03-30T02:36:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You don't have to keep talking about it, though. It's like you're trying to show off.

@time=2014-03-30T02:36:35.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But yeah I think this branch is pretty much over.  Maybe some other conservator team will have to deal with Emi Fukuda but...
@time=2014-03-30T02:36:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Implying is dumb. I'd rather [action] just be done, even if repetitive, etc.
