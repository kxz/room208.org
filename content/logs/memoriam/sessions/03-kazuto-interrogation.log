@time=2013-08-21T03:37:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It was her idea to steal the books. I just happened to agree it was a good one." **
@time=2013-08-21T03:37:27.000Z :Iverjun PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It clearly wasn't," Jun snaps.
@time=2013-08-21T03:38:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You wouldn't say that if you knew why she was doing it. But maybe you ought to hear that from the girl herself." **
@time=2013-08-21T03:39:43.000Z :Barcode[YANO_Hitomi] PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Alright." Hitomi tosses down the cigarette and stomps it flat with more force than necessary. "That's good enough for me."
@time=2013-08-21T03:40:07.000Z :Iverjun PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Jun clenches her hand into a fist again and her knuckles whiten. For a moment she honestly considers smashing the punk's face in, but then she catches herself. "Yeah, fine, let's turn him over and find this girl."
@time=2013-08-21T03:41:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So much violence from the girl who's supposed to be there to take the blows. My word. ;)
@time=2013-08-21T03:42:30.000Z :Iverjun PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I've decided to play a character that's struggling with a violent tendency. I should finish up the backstory I was writing so you can see.

@time=2013-08-21T03:44:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuto clambers up to his feet. His face is bloodied, but still recognizable. "Wonderful. I look forward to a less violent relationship between us." **

@time=2013-08-21T03:47:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Do you guys have a plan? :p
@time=2013-08-21T03:47:46.000Z :Iverjun PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I believe the plan is to turn him over to the Kyubics and ask about where we can find the rest of his team.
