@time=2015-01-24T22:09:41.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki realizes how crazy that sounds as he says it.
@time=2015-01-24T22:10:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And apparently, you have some quality that makes you worthy of that duty."
@time=2015-01-24T22:10:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I think I heard that in a movie once," Chiaki says.
@time=2015-01-24T22:10:30.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It's an important duty.  It can be difficult, but it's worthwhile."
@time=2015-01-24T22:10:34.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki smiles and shrugs.
@time=2015-01-24T22:10:52.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("This isn't a movie." "I heard that in a movie once too!")
@time=2015-01-24T22:11:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And in return, I get a wish. I remember that."
@time=2015-01-24T22:11:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Oh, right, the wish thing."
@time=2015-01-24T22:12:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Such nonchalance.
@time=2015-01-24T22:12:35.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :we're all veteran magical girls here, the wish is but a distant memory
@time=2015-01-24T22:12:37.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki's wish wasn't important to him. It couldn't affect most the things he wantd.
@time=2015-01-24T22:12:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I know.
@time=2015-01-24T22:13:01.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It'd be better for someone else to talk about that.
@time=2015-01-24T22:13:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :tl;dr Kazuki's a magical trust fund kid.
@time=2015-01-24T22:13:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Like Hikari or Rin.
@time=2015-01-24T22:13:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Rin: "I wished to save your life." Chiaki J. Fox: "This is heavy.")
@time=2015-01-24T22:14:08.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :i don't even remember hikari or rin's wish
@time=2015-01-24T22:14:15.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Is there something wrong with gravity in the future?"
@time=2015-01-24T22:15:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: I don't think that was ever actually explained, lol.
@time=2015-01-24T22:15:47.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I've gotta go.
@time=2015-01-24T22:15:51.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sorry.
@time=2015-01-24T22:16:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Right, we'll call it here and pick up next time, then.
@time=2015-01-24T22:16:07.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :there was the thing you had us all write
@time=2015-01-24T22:16:18.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I need to finish that...
@time=2015-01-24T22:16:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for running the session.
@time=2015-01-24T22:16:21.000Z :Rig QUIT :Remote host closed the connection
@time=2015-01-24T22:16:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for playing, folks. See you same time next week, unless Rig wants it.
@time=2015-01-24T22:16:44.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yes, a wish... like Kazuki said, you're able to become a magical girl if you seem to have potential, in exchange for a wish, and" Hikari has a bit of trouble with the words, "protecting the non-magical people. Conservators like us keep an eye on Conservatorship as well"
@time=2015-01-24T22:16:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Ack, sorry, wanted to at least get that -_-)
@time=2015-01-24T22:17:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Next time we'll have an actual plot going, maybe. :p
