@time=2014-05-16T22:05:30.000Z :Barcode PART #madokamadness
@time=2014-05-16T22:05:41.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm not drunk or drunklike.
@time=2014-05-16T22:05:45.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't even absinthe.
@time=2014-05-16T22:05:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Last we left off, Michi had just prised Rin off of her roommate, Tsubaki.
@time=2014-05-16T22:06:01.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :for a second I read "Rin" as "Rig" and was very confused :V
@time=2014-05-16T22:06:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako and Hikari have found themselves in the awkward position of trying to investigate Michi while simultaneously distancing themselves from Rin's actions.
@time=2014-05-16T22:07:05.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :good job Rin
@time=2014-05-16T22:07:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't think we agreed on what's getting done here. I could see Ayako and Hikari trying to butter up Michi while they're at the hospital.
@time=2014-05-16T22:07:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or, failing that, we can smash cut to the girls returning to report to Shii.
@time=2014-05-16T22:08:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Your call.
@time=2014-05-16T22:08:14.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: what do you think
@time=2014-05-16T22:08:28.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think maybe Rin needs to, I dunno, wait in the lounge while Ayako and Hikari chat with Michi.
@time=2014-05-16T22:08:36.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("Grab us some tea will you, please?")
@time=2014-05-16T22:08:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or, like, not be anywhere near the proceedings.
@time=2014-05-16T22:08:46.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Basically.
@time=2014-05-16T22:09:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You sure you want to put Rin in charge of hot beverages?
@time=2014-05-16T22:09:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Oops, my hand slipped. I hope you didn't get severe burns from my excessively hot tea."
@time=2014-05-16T22:09:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Good point.
@time=2014-05-16T22:10:19.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: How are you with that.
@time=2014-05-16T22:10:32.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm okay with that.
@time=2014-05-16T22:10:49.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Though with different stuff. Maybe just some cold tea.
@time=2014-05-16T22:11:05.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, maybe sending Rin off to go buy some tea and cookies
@time=2014-05-16T22:11:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, then. Action!
@time=2014-05-16T22:11:47.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :is cold tea even a thing in Japan
@time=2014-05-16T22:12:34.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :vaguely remember having some several years ago
@time=2014-05-16T22:12:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes, it is. You can get it quite conveniently out of vending machines.
@time=2014-05-16T22:13:12.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's pretty good.
@time=2014-05-16T22:13:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, *waves hands to indicate the cameras are rolling*
@time=2014-05-16T22:13:22.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Heh.
@time=2014-05-16T22:13:35.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: So we're in the hospital waiting room or something with Michi?
@time=2014-05-16T22:14:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, presumably first the other two try to handle Rin.
@time=2014-05-16T22:14:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Then once she's accounted for, they can talk to Michi.
@time=2014-05-16T22:17:27.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari peeks into where Michi is with Tsubaki, before returning to Rin and Ayako. "Rin, if I may, I'd rather you let Ayako and I handle the girls in there. Still, just... what caused the outburst? What did she do that was so bad?"
@time=2014-05-16T22:17:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Feel free to improvise the answer to that question.
@time=2014-05-16T22:18:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Don't need to run it by me or anything.
@time=2014-05-16T22:18:20.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I believe Rin's participation in the last session ended with her leaving via the stairs
@time=2014-05-16T22:18:32.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Also, visualize Hikari sighing right there. Forgot.)
@time=2014-05-16T22:18:43.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: I think we've moved onto the hospital now, in between scenes.
@time=2014-05-16T22:18:49.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ah
@time=2014-05-16T22:22:12.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005?
@time=2014-05-16T22:22:44.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :still here
@time=2014-05-16T22:22:55.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I believe that Hikari asked Rin a question.
@time=2014-05-16T22:22:59.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-05-16T22:23:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Don't worry about improvisations and such.
@time=2014-05-16T22:23:31.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin's probably too pissed off even thinking about it to be eloquent anyways
@time=2014-05-16T22:25:31.000Z :SpruceZeus PART #madokamadness
@time=2014-05-16T22:26:22.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005?
@time=2014-05-16T22:26:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ACTION continues waving hands
@time=2014-05-16T22:27:12.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe we should just suppose Rin says something.  I was never sure how to explain Sumire's bullying either.
@time=2014-05-16T22:28:18.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She and her friends..." Rin clenches her fists as she tries to stay calm
@time=2014-05-16T22:28:42.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Just ask Ayako"
@time=2014-05-16T22:29:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahahaha.
@time=2014-05-16T22:30:23.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :of course Rin didn't tell Ayako anything either.
@time=2014-05-16T22:31:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :No, that just means it's your chance to make things up. :D
@time=2014-05-16T22:31:09.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :there is the sorta-non-answer Rin gave as justification in the last session
@time=2014-05-16T22:33:38.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"All she told me was that they made her life hell.  I know that before Saki took me in there were a few kids who liked to make me feel bad for having my head in a book all the time, but nothing that would make me want to punch them now..."
@time=2014-05-16T22:36:41.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Taking in what Ayako has to say, Hikari briefly goes silent. "Well, thank you." She turns to Rin. "I think it's best that you stay this one out. We are here to find out information for Yumiko, and need to handle Michi carefully. Could you maybe go grab us some snacks, please?"
@time=2014-05-16T22:37:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari shuffles around, trying to not be tactless. "At least, you will be away from Tsubaki."
@time=2014-05-16T22:37:14.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah, sure."
@time=2014-05-16T22:37:23.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Thank you."
@time=2014-05-16T22:38:21.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :and now I guess we walk to wherever Michi is?
@time=2014-05-16T22:38:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She's in a waiting room.
@time=2014-05-16T22:39:02.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or then I guess walk over to Michi?
@time=2014-05-16T22:39:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, whatever works.
@time=2014-05-16T22:40:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Michi's alone, poking at her cell phone. The hospital isn't that busy, so there are conveniently a large number of empty seats near her.
@time=2014-05-16T22:41:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako walks towards Michi's seat, taking one almost adjacent.
@time=2014-05-16T22:42:36.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Uh...Michi, right?"
@time=2014-05-16T22:43:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hm?" Michi turns to look at Ayako. "Oh, it's you."
@time=2014-05-16T22:43:51.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What's the tone of that supposed to be? >_>
@time=2014-05-16T22:44:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It's good to see you're not hurt too badly." Michi puts away her phone.
@time=2014-05-16T22:44:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Did you know that girl?" she asks Ayako.
@time=2014-05-16T22:44:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("HOW ARE YOU GENTLEMEN")
@time=2014-05-16T22:45:35.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :( :? )
@time=2014-05-16T22:45:53.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You mean Rin?  I know her, though not too well."
@time=2014-05-16T22:47:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Is she a classmate of yours or something?"
@time=2014-05-16T22:49:32.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"...Sort of.  She seemed to really have it out for your friend for some reason.  I got in the middle.  It was a bad idea."
@time=2014-05-16T22:50:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Either way, I appreciate it."
@time=2014-05-16T22:50:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Michi changes tack. "So what brought you to my building? Bad luck?" she asks in a lighthearted tone.
@time=2014-05-16T22:51:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari sits down across from Ayako, next to Michi. "Excuse me, I'm with Ayako here. Pleased to-" she stops, answering instead. "We were following along, not really going anywhere with Rin, until... that happened."
@time=2014-05-16T22:54:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"So bad luck." Michi laughs.
@time=2014-05-16T22:55:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You have some interesting friends," she says, looking at Ayako in particular.
@time=2014-05-16T22:57:38.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hm?"
@time=2014-05-16T22:58:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It's nothing. Just... a little unexpected.
@time=2014-05-16T22:59:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"How do I say it? If I had to guess, you're kind of a straight arrow.
@time=2014-05-16T23:00:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"No offense to you," she says to Hikari. "But you don't seem the type. And definitely not your friend," she says, jerking her head back towards the exit.
@time=2014-05-16T23:01:28.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Er, sorry. Seem the type to get into trouble?)
@time=2014-05-16T23:01:42.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She's saying that Hikari and Rin clearly aren't straight-arrow types
@time=2014-05-16T23:01:47.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, ooh.
@time=2014-05-16T23:02:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Oh I see it now. Sorry.)
@time=2014-05-16T23:06:11.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hikari, what was the name of that girl you were talking to us about earlier?  Yumiko?"
@time=2014-05-16T23:06:19.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari forces herself to hold her smile. "Well, I guess it fits, haha." she responds, not really sure what to say. "And Rin definitely has surprises in her." She tries to laugh, failing."
@time=2014-05-16T23:06:53.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The goal, after all, was to figure out more about Yumiko, and there was little space for a good opening.
@time=2014-05-16T23:07:04.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She looks over. "Yes, Yumiko was her name. She's not doing too well, unfortunately."
@time=2014-05-16T23:07:04.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :also I think Hikari's line should come before Ayako's.  :V
@time=2014-05-16T23:07:17.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Yeah, bad timing. Sorry.)
@time=2014-05-16T23:07:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Is this within earshot of Michi?
@time=2014-05-16T23:08:26.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Given that I think Michi's now between Ayako and Hikari, the answer's yes.
@time=2014-05-16T23:08:31.000Z :jseblan QUIT :Ping timeout: 186 seconds
@time=2014-05-16T23:09:04.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I believe ponner's going for bringing her up to Hikari, so as to ask Michi, somehow.
@time=2014-05-16T23:09:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Michi's visibly taken aback by the shift in the conversation.
@time=2014-05-16T23:09:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yumiko? You don't mean Kayano, do you?"
@time=2014-05-16T23:10:45.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I think so.  You know her?"
@time=2014-05-16T23:11:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You think so? lol
@time=2014-05-16T23:12:48.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah that was poorly phrased.  Whatever.  Ayako's not the greatest at this "talking about magical things without letting on that they're magical" thing, I guess
@time=2014-05-16T23:13:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Are you...? Wait, hold on a second."
@time=2014-05-16T23:13:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Michi looks up at the ceiling and calls a single name. "Nyoma?"
@time=2014-05-16T23:14:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sure enough, with a flash, the familiar appears on her lap.
@time=2014-05-16T23:17:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :**
@time=2014-05-16T23:19:22.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(I'm not sure what to sya. >_<)
@time=2014-05-16T23:19:43.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(same >_< I guess probably we should just admit to being conservators, since Nyoma would know for sure anyways)
@time=2014-05-16T23:20:17.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Should Rin return with cookies now?)
@time=2014-05-16T23:21:40.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Will she want to punch Michi for associating with her? :P)
@time=2014-05-16T23:21:45.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Also I dunno.)
@time=2014-05-16T23:22:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noticing the lack of reaction from the two girls, Michi deduces what's going on.
@time=2014-05-16T23:23:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You're initiates, aren't you?"
@time=2014-05-16T23:25:35.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yes, we are. And you are as well, naturally."
@time=2014-05-16T23:27:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Of course.
@time=2014-05-16T23:27:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What about your friend Rin?"
@time=2014-05-16T23:28:10.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She is as well."
@time=2014-05-16T23:28:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"So I take it you all were looking for me, then."
@time=2014-05-16T23:28:59.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That...that would be right."
@time=2014-05-16T23:29:28.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako looked at Hikari, with a bit of concern.  Michi definitely had a talent for reading people.
@time=2014-05-16T23:30:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, I mean, she's probably the only initiate in that dorm block...
@time=2014-05-16T23:30:30.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was also thinking of the straight-shooter thing was probably supposed to imply that.  Maybe I'm being dumb.
@time=2014-05-16T23:30:44.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(I was too.)
@time=2014-05-16T23:30:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, yeah, maybe.
@time=2014-05-16T23:31:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It was more of an oblique reference to Ayako being rather more bookish than the other two.
@time=2014-05-16T23:31:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway --
@time=2014-05-16T23:32:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Nyoma, who up until this point doesn't seem to have realized where he is, slides off of Michi's lap and onto the ground, looking at the three girls.
@time=2014-05-16T23:33:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Michi?" He scans his eyes across the group. "And you two were... the ones I just saw a little while ago?"
@time=2014-05-16T23:33:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He returns his eyes to Michi. "Did you need me for something?"
@time=2014-05-16T23:34:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I was just testing these two," Michi says. "Sorry. I didn't know they were initiates."
@time=2014-05-16T23:35:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Nyoma corrects her. "They're not just initiates. They're Conservators. If I remember right, I sent them to talk to you about Kayano..."
@time=2014-05-16T23:35:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Not pictured: Ayako and Hikari making D: faces.)
@time=2014-05-16T23:36:03.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :basically
@time=2014-05-16T23:36:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Ah, that would explain it..." Michi says.
@time=2014-05-16T23:36:41.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Hikari would never do that in this situation.)
@time=2014-05-16T23:37:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Where's the other girl that was with you two?" Nyoma asks.
@time=2014-05-16T23:37:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Other girl?" Michi repeats. "You don't mean..."
@time=2014-05-16T23:41:23.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Nyoma means Rin."
@time=2014-05-16T23:42:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She's a Conservator?"

If the elders trust her judgment, so should I, but how do I trust someone when I look at her face and see the person who punched me to get to her...what was the word she used...retribution?"
