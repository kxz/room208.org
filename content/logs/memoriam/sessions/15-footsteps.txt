[21-Mar-2014 20:13:57]  <IllFlower> Last we left off, Ayako and Hikari had just intervened against Mai's would-be assailants.
[21-Mar-2014 20:14:30]  <ponicalica> Buttercupistiny: yes yes I am
[21-Mar-2014 20:14:48]  <IllFlower> The Conservators were debating whether to take all of them in for swift magical justice.
[21-Mar-2014 20:15:56]  <ponicalica> Over the last like two weeks I questioned to myself what actual cops would do in a situation like this.  But I think the answer is "They'd call for reinforcements".
[21-Mar-2014 20:16:11]  <IllFlower> According to the attackers, they went after Mai for being a potential threat to Satsuki's life and limb.
[21-Mar-2014 20:16:17]  <IllFlower> Is that actually the case? Who knows.
[21-Mar-2014 20:17:21]  <IllFlower> What I do know is, damn, are these cookies ever tasty.
[21-Mar-2014 20:17:41]  <Alicia> What flavor.
[21-Mar-2014 20:18:21]  <IllFlower> Tasty flavor.
[21-Mar-2014 20:18:29]  <ponicalica> how specific
[21-Mar-2014 20:18:59]  <BGTB2005> best cookies ever tasty?
[21-Mar-2014 20:19:46]  <IllFlower> No, otherwise I'd blow this joint and just eat cookies all day.
[21-Mar-2014 20:20:04]  <ponicalica> How much would we risk releasing Mai if we engaged the attackers
[21-Mar-2014 20:20:27]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Well, calling for reinforcements is an option. Dunno if it'd be that effective, but it's there!

[21-Mar-2014 20:21:13]  <IllFlower> I dunno if Mai cares to run away all that much. She'll be displeased if you go back on her immunity, but will she fight you? Eh.
[21-Mar-2014 20:22:08]  <IllFlower> I mean, she made Ayako tea and everything. Have you already forgotten her kindness? /dramatic sob

[21-Mar-2014 20:24:52]  <Alicia> Call for reninforcements *and* take her in? No.
[21-Mar-2014 20:25:22]  <ponicalica> call for reinforcements, engage the attackers, and then take four people in
[21-Mar-2014 20:26:20]  <ponicalica> of course unless the reinforcements include BGTB2005 rolling up a character I think the mechanics would make them useless so
[21-Mar-2014 20:26:48]  <ponicalica> or they'd be, like, an improvised weapon
[21-Mar-2014 20:26:55]  <Alicia> BGTB summons Okuu.
[21-Mar-2014 20:27:12]  <Alicia> But yeah, dunno about reinforcements.

[21-Mar-2014 20:29:15]  <IllFlower> The mechanics don't prevent me from rolling up an entire NPC to help you guys, but my laziness does.
[21-Mar-2014 20:29:47]  <ponicalica> right, right
[21-Mar-2014 20:30:02]  <IllFlower> You get 2d6 plus a trait otherwise.
[21-Mar-2014 20:30:15]  <IllFlower> A 2d6 stat boost, I should say.
[21-Mar-2014 20:32:04]  <ponicalica> what'd you think, Alicia
[21-Mar-2014 20:33:07]  <Alicia> Well, I'd be fine with that, ponicalica.
[21-Mar-2014 20:33:15]  <IllFlower> Satsuki's followers exchange uneasy glances with each other, occasionally looking sidelong at the Conservators present. It's safe to say that they weren't expecting so much deliberation about their fate.
[21-Mar-2014 20:33:21]  <ponicalica> hahaha
[21-Mar-2014 20:33:37]  <IllFlower> "Do you think they have something... 'special' in mind for us?" one of the girls whispers nervously.
[21-Mar-2014 20:33:47]  <Alicia> (Oh yes. :D)
[21-Mar-2014 20:34:10]  <IllFlower> The other girl simply shakes her head, apparently trying her hardest not to think about it too much.
[21-Mar-2014 20:35:37]  <ponicalica> "You're under arrest for involement in the cult of Satsuki Osada, responsible for the deaths of Sanae Tanimura and the Conservator Jun Takanashi!"

[21-Mar-2014 20:43:04]  <Alicia> Yeah actually no.
[21-Mar-2014 20:44:03]  <ponicalica> hm?
[21-Mar-2014 20:44:43]  <Alicia> I was implying just knocking them out. But. >_>
[21-Mar-2014 20:46:28]  <ponicalica> you mean just start the conflict?
[21-Mar-2014 20:47:46]  <IllFlower> You guys did just try to beat them into submission.
[21-Mar-2014 20:47:50]  <Alicia> Oh, hm. Nah, but they really aren't listening to the fact that they should be in cuffs (magicuffs?) by now.
[21-Mar-2014 20:48:56]  <IllFlower> Although things may not go so well for you this time. There's no assurances that my dice will be as poor as they were in the last conflict.
[21-Mar-2014 20:49:32]  <Alicia> Yes. `-`
[21-Mar-2014 20:51:35]  <Alicia> ponicalica, any ideas to make them shush and follow along?
[21-Mar-2014 20:51:42]  <Alicia> (>Implying they'd follow along.)
[21-Mar-2014 20:52:06]  <ponicalica> Alicia: Not really.  Our choice is probably to beat them into submission again or walk away with just Mai and go after the cult later
[21-Mar-2014 20:53:00]  <Alicia> I... don't think I want to risk beating them into submission? You? Just taking Mai is fine.
[21-Mar-2014 20:53:24]  <IllFlower> Mai would probably be incredibly unhappy, just saying.
[21-Mar-2014 20:53:57]  <ponicalica> IllFlower clearly has a very particular priority with regards to this :P
[21-Mar-2014 20:54:00]  <Alicia> I think someone is going to be unhappy no matter what we decide.
[21-Mar-2014 20:54:04]  <Alicia> >_>
[21-Mar-2014 20:54:10]  <Alicia> at least one person*
[21-Mar-2014 20:54:43]  <IllFlower> I'm just playing devil's advocate.
[21-Mar-2014 20:54:51]  <IllFlower> That's my responsibility, isn't it? :D
[21-Mar-2014 20:56:32]  <ponicalica> Part of me thinks that we should go after 'em again anyways but from a more meta perspective doing something other than another fight with the same characters would probably be more fun.
[21-Mar-2014 20:58:23]  <Alicia> Oh yeah.
[21-Mar-2014 20:59:13]  <IllFlower> The girls, standing a couple of meters behind their male comrade, look tensely at each other.
[21-Mar-2014 20:59:17]  <ponicalica> Though I get the feeling that it would be hard to de-escalate in a non-awkward way.
[21-Mar-2014 20:59:36]  <ponicalica> ("Shit, our reinforcements are stuck in traffic.  Oh well, see y'all later.")
[21-Mar-2014 20:59:37]  <IllFlower> It doesn't look like they care as much for open defiance.
[21-Mar-2014 21:00:06]  <IllFlower> Perhaps there might be a way to ply them away from the boy...
[21-Mar-2014 21:00:50]  <ponicalica> ("Too bad both Hikari and Ayako are basically social incompetents.")
[21-Mar-2014 21:03:30]  <ponicalica> "If you come quietly, it will be taken into account during sentencing."
[21-Mar-2014 21:04:15]  <IllFlower> I think that might just have scared them.
[21-Mar-2014 21:04:20]  <ponicalica> oh
[21-Mar-2014 21:04:26]  <ponicalica> yeah clearly Ayako shouldn't be talking.
[21-Mar-2014 21:04:59]  <Alicia> And the boy isn't having any of Hikari's crap. The girls are different, I think.
[21-Mar-2014 21:05:14]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[21-Mar-2014 21:08:31]  <IllFlower> You can push on one corner of the edifice and watch it fall down.

[21-Mar-2014 21:17:44]  <Alicia> Dunno, depends on how close these three are, too.

[21-Mar-2014 21:19:11]  <ponicalica> Well, IllFlower suggests splitting the girls from the boy but I have no idea how to even start at that and Ayako has even less of one, lol
[21-Mar-2014 21:19:28]  <Alicia> Ayako can blind them. B-)
[21-Mar-2014 21:19:35]  <Alicia> (No, that's escalating.)
[21-Mar-2014 21:22:04]  <IllFlower> "I hope you're not planning on just letting them go," Mai says, glaring at Ayako and Hikari.
[21-Mar-2014 21:22:25]  <Alicia> No ideas are coming to mind that don't involve at least one person with two others, since we can't reaaally have *Mai* watch over someone. Well we could I guess, and make the judgment less something for her.
[21-Mar-2014 21:22:49]  <Alicia> After all, she's at least not with a cult.
[21-Mar-2014 21:23:17]  <ponicalica> "We wouldn't like to, Mai, but two conservators against three assailants isn't good odds, especially with a fourth culprit we have to keep from escaping..."
[21-Mar-2014 21:24:55]  <IllFlower> "So that's all I am to you, after all." Mai sighs. "Well, I wasn't looking for reasons to make a break for it, but if that's how you see things..."

[21-Mar-2014 21:33:15]  <IllFlower> Mai smiles.
[21-Mar-2014 21:33:41]  <IllFlower> "You're Conservators, right?" she says, loudly enough that everyone can hear.
[21-Mar-2014 21:33:58]  <IllFlower> "I know there are rules you have to play by when it comes to these three.

[21-Mar-2014 21:35:55]  <IllFlower> Maybe he does have a point. Mai's not exactly tall.
[21-Mar-2014 21:37:17]  <Alicia> No, but she setup that barrier. I don't imagine Ayako's the tallest either, but she's good with magic. :p
[21-Mar-2014 21:37:38]  <IllFlower> But she doesn't flinch. "And what about it? I've run into the Conservators before," she says, indicating Ayako and Hikari, "and yet here I am. Do I look like I've been locked up?"

[21-Mar-2014 21:39:34]  <IllFlower> She looks the boy directly in the eye. "Even if they don't want you, I do. And I have a lot less in the way of moral compunction. So would you care to try your luck?"

[21-Mar-2014 21:41:11]  <IllFlower> She seems to lose her confidence halfway through, though, and her arm falls back to her side.

[21-Mar-2014 21:49:19]  <IllFlower> The boy looks at the three girls opposite him, his lips still fixed in a flat line.
[21-Mar-2014 21:52:16]  <IllFlower> "Fine, then so be it," he says, putting his hands up in the air. "Figures you'd let her do the dirty work."
[21-Mar-2014 21:55:33]  <Alicia> "It's good that you're finally being cooperative." Hikari says, handcuffing him, before checking on the other two.

[21-Mar-2014 22:02:29]  <Alicia> Walk in a single file line to the nearest Conservator Suspect Transportation Center. Follow orders and all should go fine.
[21-Mar-2014 22:03:08]  <Alicia> Or, I guess we could make it go fine.
[21-Mar-2014 22:03:22]  <Alicia> (well*, whatevs.)
[21-Mar-2014 22:04:01]  <IllFlower> So that happens.
[21-Mar-2014 22:04:26]  <IllFlower> What of Mai's case?
[21-Mar-2014 22:05:38]  <ponicalica> I think Ayako's not really a huge fan of just letting Mai go on her merry way but that probably is the best idea, unless Hikari has other ideas
[21-Mar-2014 22:07:06]  <IllFlower> She does know things about Satsuki that the Conservators don't.
[21-Mar-2014 22:07:26]  <Alicia> Hikari'd be appreciating her making them go away peacably, but rules are rules... so she could come under our wing, or something.
[21-Mar-2014 22:07:31]  <Alicia> Well "under," see

[21-Mar-2014 22:08:15]  <BGTB2005> maybe leave her in protective custody where she can answer questions over tea and cookies?
[21-Mar-2014 22:08:22]  <Alicia> ponicalica: No no.
[21-Mar-2014 22:08:56]  <ponicalica> and yeah, maybe just throw her in protective custody and have her dictate everything to a familiar or whatever

[21-Mar-2014 22:32:40]  <ponicalica> "So Mai...where exactly would we be able to find Emi or Satsuki?"
[21-Mar-2014 22:35:18]  <IllFlower> The sun filters through the dust-covered windows in Shii's base of operations.
[21-Mar-2014 22:35:37]  <IllFlower> Mai answers almost reflexively.
[21-Mar-2014 22:36:16]  <IllFlower> "Emi Fukuda's gone into hiding. Given the number of people who seem to be after her, I don't think she really has any other choice.
[21-Mar-2014 22:37:31]  <IllFlower> "Satsuki Osada... after what happened with Tsuchida and your friend, they've been trying to stay out of sight as well. But they can't very well sate their bloodlust living underneath a rock.
[21-Mar-2014 22:39:16]  <IllFlower> "If I had to pick," she finally says, "I'd go back west. All of the deaths related to this mess have been centered around..."
[21-Mar-2014 22:39:58]  <IllFlower> A map sits on the table in front of her. Mai pulls out a red marker and draws a wide, sloppy circle around a few neighborhoods in the suburbs.
[21-Mar-2014 22:40:22]  <IllFlower> "It's an obvious guess, but you have to start somewhere."
[21-Mar-2014 22:41:30]  <ponicalica> "Do you know why they targeted those neighborhoods?"
[21-Mar-2014 22:44:13]  <IllFlower> "Emi lives there. Well, lived, I suppose. That's where everything got started..."

[21-Mar-2014 22:51:30]  <Alicia> Or wait.
[21-Mar-2014 22:51:58]  <Alicia> When I mean deserted, I meant Emi's housing in particular. Obviously it's not totally silent given, well, all the deaths there.
[21-Mar-2014 22:52:18]  <ponicalica> well she probably has a family, they might still live there
[21-Mar-2014 22:52:35]  <ponicalica> "Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Fukuda.  We're, uh, magical girls."
[21-Mar-2014 22:53:17]  <Alicia> Point. >_>;
[21-Mar-2014 22:54:20]  <ponicalica> then again, she's from means, maybe we could pose as maids and sneak in

[21-Mar-2014 22:55:26]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: yeah that's probably more straightforward
[21-Mar-2014 22:55:27]  <Alicia> )
[21-Mar-2014 22:55:35]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[21-Mar-2014 22:55:49]  <ponicalica> ("We let her move in with her aunt and her uncle.  They live in a rich neighborhood in America...")
[21-Mar-2014 22:56:10]  <Fiora> ("So this is the story all about how...")
[21-Mar-2014 22:56:21]  <Alicia> (Oh my God. I didn't even mean it like that.)
[21-Mar-2014 22:56:34]  <Alicia> (But. Sure. xD)
[21-Mar-2014 22:57:21]  <IllFlower> So what's the plan?
[21-Mar-2014 22:57:58]  <Alicia> Head on over there posing as concerned friends, ponicalica?
[21-Mar-2014 22:58:03]  <Alicia> Or something similar.
[21-Mar-2014 22:58:10]  <ponicalica> Alicia: yeah that might work, if Mai gives a location, lol
[21-Mar-2014 22:58:58]  <IllFlower> Assume she does.
[21-Mar-2014 23:04:48]  <IllFlower> Someone might want to take us there...
[21-Mar-2014 23:07:39]  <ponicalica> do you mean Mai or one of us
[21-Mar-2014 23:10:17]  <IllFlower> One of you, I'm guessing.
[21-Mar-2014 23:10:22]  <IllFlower> Unless you want Mai to tag along.
[21-Mar-2014 23:11:10]  <Alicia> Well, they're after her, so maybe not?
[21-Mar-2014 23:11:24]  <Alicia> Though she doesn't seem, well, weak. >_>;
[21-Mar-2014 23:11:29]  <Alicia> ponicalica: I'm fine either way.
[21-Mar-2014 23:11:49]  <ponicalica> Ayako and Hikari set off towards the appropriately large building Mai identified as belonging to the Fukuda family

[21-Mar-2014 23:19:03]  <ponicalica> They quickly mention themselves as Emi's friends who were asked to bring her some personal belonging.
[21-Mar-2014 23:20:45]  <IllFlower> Emi's mother, who is at the door, looks at Ayako and Hikari skeptically.
[21-Mar-2014 23:21:24]  <IllFlower> "Emi hasn't been home for a few days," she says, with a mix of concern and annoyance.
[21-Mar-2014 23:22:46]  <ponicalica> "She's hiding for a while.  She sent us over to bring her her...uh..." Ayako tries to think of something she might have left
[21-Mar-2014 23:24:15]  <IllFlower> On hearing "she's hiding for a while," Emi's mother's face slackens, as if she's trying to make sense of someone's fevered rambling.
[21-Mar-2014 23:24:48]  <IllFlower> "Hiding? She's been missing. What do you mean by hiding?"
[21-Mar-2014 23:26:07]  <ponicalica> Ayako suddenly realizes she said something she probably shouldn't've.  She whispers to Hikari: "Hmm, maybe you will be able to explain it better?"
[21-Mar-2014 23:28:28]  <IllFlower> What, you thought the investigations would be as easy as they are in anime? Ohohoho.

[21-Mar-2014 23:30:18]  <Alicia> "Well, every person we've talked to that is on familiar terms with her believes she's out there, and considering the searches for her haven't helped any... that's our best guess, anyway."
[21-Mar-2014 23:30:53]  <IllFlower> Didn't you say you were her friends?
[21-Mar-2014 23:31:18]  <Alicia> Friends talk, yeah. I meant like talking to other friends, etc., but that came out weirder than intended.
[21-Mar-2014 23:31:31]  <ponicalica> this is the danger of only having low-Ht characters on your team I guess
[21-Mar-2014 23:31:56]  <IllFlower> "We're friends, but not familiar ones. You know, it's complicated."
[21-Mar-2014 23:32:04]  <Alicia> Snerk. >_>;
[21-Mar-2014 23:32:49]  <Alicia> I dunno, did say everyone, not just friends. Even this person we just made up, huh Ayako.
[21-Mar-2014 23:32:56]  <Alicia> (But really, sorry for the bad wording.)
[21-Mar-2014 23:33:22]  <IllFlower> I'm not really sure what you're trying to get at with this conversation...
[21-Mar-2014 23:33:39]  <ponicalica> trying to get into Emi's room
[21-Mar-2014 23:34:45]  <IllFlower> To what end?
[21-Mar-2014 23:35:31]  <ponicalica> She might have something in there that suggests something about her organization maybe?
[21-Mar-2014 23:36:42]  <IllFlower> Hm, okay.
[21-Mar-2014 23:37:06]  <IllFlower> You'll have to salvage this current exchange, though.
[21-Mar-2014 23:37:52]  <Alicia> ponicalica?
[21-Mar-2014 23:38:21]  <ponicalica> Well Alicia said something and it wasn't responded to I think?
[21-Mar-2014 23:38:30]  <IllFlower> Maybe you can invent another missing friend, claim a connection, and ask about investigating for clues.
[21-Mar-2014 23:38:40]  <IllFlower> It worked for Kaiki!

[21-Mar-2014 23:41:30]  <ponicalica> "We think there's a connection to another girl who has disappeared recently, Mai Shirakawa, and that there might be clues in her notebooks."
[21-Mar-2014 23:42:04]  <IllFlower> "Another one?" Mrs. Fukuda's eyes widen.
[21-Mar-2014 23:42:19]  <IllFlower> "I hadn't heard..."
[21-Mar-2014 23:44:37]  <ponicalica> "Yeah.  She also went into hiding, and she contacted us about Emi.  She doesn't know exactly where she is but gave hints..."
[21-Mar-2014 23:45:11]  <IllFlower> Gotta nix the whole "hiding" thing, man.
[21-Mar-2014 23:45:23]  <IllFlower> Emi's mother obviously doesn't know the story, hence.
[21-Mar-2014 23:49:36]  <Alicia> "Others beside Shirakawa have disappeared too, but she provides the strongest possible link to finding Mai."

[21-Mar-2014 23:52:14]  <IllFlower> She vanishes behind the door for a moment or two before returning.
[21-Mar-2014 23:52:29]  <IllFlower> "Come in," she says cordially.
[21-Mar-2014 23:52:40]  <ponicalica> Ayako steps in
[21-Mar-2014 23:52:57]  <IllFlower> "If there's anything I can do... if we can find your friend, or Emi..."
[21-Mar-2014 23:53:40]  <ponicalica> "We'll find Emi for you."
[21-Mar-2014 23:54:13]  <IllFlower> "Thank you. I hope you do."
[21-Mar-2014 23:55:30]  <ponicalica> "So which of these rooms is hers?"
[21-Mar-2014 23:55:52]  <IllFlower> Direct, aren't we? :p
[21-Mar-2014 23:56:47]  <IllFlower> Mrs. Fukuda walks the girls up the house's central stairwell, leading to a hallway that runs along the outside of the Y-shaped home.
[21-Mar-2014 23:57:22]  <IllFlower> Light pours in from full-height windows providing a panoramic view of the cityscape.
[21-Mar-2014 23:57:44]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Ayako is not exactly good at conversation, as has been aptly demonstrated this entire campaign
[21-Mar-2014 23:57:47]  <IllFlower> "Here it is," she says, opening the door. "Take your time."
[21-Mar-2014 23:58:21]  <IllFlower> It looks exactly like what you'd have expected Emi's room to look like.
[21-Mar-2014 23:58:47]  <IllFlower> The bedsheets probably cost more by themselves than Ayako's house.
[21-Mar-2014 23:59:00]  <Alicia> "Thank you, we appreciate it Mrs. Fukuda." Hikari says before stepping inside.
[21-Mar-2014 23:59:19]  <ponicalica> "You look through her possessions, Hikari.  I'll do a trace for magical energies first."  Ayako draws a circle similar to the one she drew at Sanae's crime scene
[21-Mar-2014 23:59:33]  <IllFlower> It's a bit of a mess. There are some clothes strewn in a corner around a laundry basket, like evidence of missed basketball shots.
[22-Mar-2014 00:00:01]  <IllFlower> The blinds are drawn, giving the entire place a bit of a melancholy hue.
[22-Mar-2014 00:00:39]  <IllFlower> The enigmatic faces of the popular male idols on the wall posters seem a bit sad in this light.
[22-Mar-2014 00:01:50]  <IllFlower> As Ayako draws the spell circle, a brilliant beam of light begins to emanate from the magical portal at its center.
[22-Mar-2014 00:02:01]  <IllFlower> There's the sound of rattling, like a minor earthquake.
[22-Mar-2014 00:02:43]  <ponicalica> I was about to ask the dumbest question: "Does Japan get earthquakes?"
[22-Mar-2014 00:02:59]  <Buttercupistiny> ...
[22-Mar-2014 00:03:15]  <IllFlower> Suddenly, the entire room goes dark, as if someone had sealed it inside a cardboard box.
[22-Mar-2014 00:03:49]  <IllFlower> "Who goes there?" a female voice intones.
[22-Mar-2014 00:03:54]  <ponicalica> Buttercupistiny: I immediately remembered the Tohoku earthquake.
[22-Mar-2014 00:05:49]  <Alicia> "Ayako." Hikari stops, closing the drawers she was rummaging through. "Do you think something was triggered, or do you always turn out the lights when doing that?"
[22-Mar-2014 00:06:22]  <ponicalica> "I don't turn out the lights.  And I definitely don't turn out the windows.  Something was triggered."
[22-Mar-2014 00:07:55]  <ponicalica> Ayako turns to face the voice.  "This is Ayako Minakami and Hikari Hiiragi.  Conservators."

[22-Mar-2014 00:29:25]  <ponicalica> Ayako uses her wand as a flashlight and begins to assist Hikari in searching the room.
[22-Mar-2014 00:29:56]  <IllFlower> There's nothing there. The room's vanished, and in its place is an endless black void.
[22-Mar-2014 00:30:10]  <Alicia> Oh dear.
[22-Mar-2014 00:31:04]  <ponicalica> someone clearly didn't want us to search her room
[22-Mar-2014 00:31:29]  <Alicia> Hmm, yeah, I'm getting that idea.
[22-Mar-2014 00:33:14]  <IllFlower> Well, unless you leave or do something to dispel the enchantment, you're going to be in here for a while.
[22-Mar-2014 00:33:30]  <IllFlower> Maybe you'll run into one of Motoko's pillow forts!
[22-Mar-2014 00:34:32]  <ponicalica> "And there's something in here, or else you wouldn't be blocking us off."  Ayako transforms.  "Hikari, help me dispel this."
[22-Mar-2014 00:35:09]  <Alicia> Hikari nods, transforming as well.
[22-Mar-2014 00:35:35]  <IllFlower> Shall we begin conflict?
[22-Mar-2014 00:35:49]  <Alicia> Yep.
[22-Mar-2014 00:35:57]  <Alicia> I mean, what else is there to do, heh.
[22-Mar-2014 00:36:07]  <IllFlower> I suppose I'll have to draft some stats. Give me a moment.

[22-Mar-2014 00:49:42]  <IllFlower> The runes Ayako draws in the air seem to fade as soon as they appear, however. It's as if the darkness isn't content to merely be the absence of light - it wants to consume the light.

[22-Mar-2014 00:55:14]  <Alicia> Hikari looks around at the formless void surrounding her, and draws out her staff while taking a defensive stance next to Ayako.

[22-Mar-2014 00:56:37]  <Alicia> Oh, right. Answer to that and then respond.
[22-Mar-2014 00:57:40]  <ponicalica> what he's saying is that that's not really a raise
[22-Mar-2014 00:59:05]  <Alicia> Yeah, need to say something else then use two other...
[22-Mar-2014 00:59:37]  <ponicalica> nah, there was nothing you needed to See
[22-Mar-2014 01:00:05]  <Alicia> .. oh. Gah. Okay then just continuing with what I thought you say.
[22-Mar-2014 01:00:51]  <IllFlower> There's not really anything in that raise that threatens the darkness.
[22-Mar-2014 01:01:40]  <Alicia> Yeah. Uh, I wasn't sure of being vocally combative in response would really count... because darkness.
[22-Mar-2014 01:01:48]  <Alicia> It's not like a person you can punch or whack. :v
[22-Mar-2014 01:02:10]  <IllFlower> It's magic, make something up.
[22-Mar-2014 01:02:13]  <ponicalica> I think yelling things at the darkness would work, as well as maybe whacking the "walls" or "floor" or whatever
[22-Mar-2014 01:03:47]  <Alicia> "You have our word, we will find the meaning behind this, and stop it." Hikari manages through gritted teeth, slamming her staff at the shadows.
[22-Mar-2014 01:07:11]  <IllFlower> A shaft of light appears in the ground where Hikari strikes it with her staff. There's another loud rumbling, accompanied by what sounds like a loud, distorted scream.

[22-Mar-2014 01:07:49]  <ponicalica> oh shit
[22-Mar-2014 01:08:30]  <IllFlower> A fierce gust of warm, damp air rushes past the girls.
[22-Mar-2014 01:09:45]  <IllFlower> The atmosphere suddenly seems to turn to water, and Ayako and Hikari, unable to breathe, lose sight of each other although they're within arm's reach of each other.
[22-Mar-2014 01:10:01]  <IllFlower> "of each other... of each other..." etc.

[22-Mar-2014 01:17:55]  <ponicalica> Ayako struggles in the water, pushing out, but she manages to choke out two syllables that produce an air bubble protecting her from drowning.

[22-Mar-2014 01:23:06]  <Alicia> Hikari clutches onto her staff, tightening her concentration. "You're not going to stop us, damn it." she mutters before pushing the water away from her with a gust of wind, settling over her as a protective barrier.
[22-Mar-2014 01:23:56]  <Alicia> (Yeah, I could only come up with some elemental whatever to get it away, I'll... I dunno, trying to find some way to work with that. Something more than "force of will.")
[22-Mar-2014 01:24:30]  <ponicalica> you can just fold

[22-Mar-2014 01:28:13]  <IllFlower> Ayako, unable to find Hikari, makes up her mind to press on.
[22-Mar-2014 01:28:17]  <IllFlower> It's not like she has another option.

[22-Mar-2014 01:39:24]  <BGTB2005> didn't you fold?

[22-Mar-2014 01:39:48]  <Alicia> Never mind.
[22-Mar-2014 01:40:36]  <ponicalica> you only take fallout when you take the blow
[22-Mar-2014 01:40:48]  <ponicalica> I think the demonic influence also took fallout, can't remember how that works
[22-Mar-2014 01:41:09]  <IllFlower> It doesn't really.

[22-Mar-2014 01:42:10]  <ponicalica> so let's see, uh, 9, what does 9 mean again?
[22-Mar-2014 01:42:42]  <IllFlower> Single long-term fallout item
[22-Mar-2014 01:43:50]  <IllFlower> At this point Ayako basically dispels the charm in as dramatic a fashion as you see fit.

[22-Mar-2014 01:46:36]  <ponicalica> Ayako pulls out her wand again.  With the final line "CONVENI LUX!" she aims at a point in the distance and with a flash of light the darkness shatters.
[22-Mar-2014 01:47:57]  <IllFlower> Just a moment.
[22-Mar-2014 01:54:52]  <IllFlower> The room reasserts its usual form around the two girls.
[22-Mar-2014 01:55:51]  <IllFlower> Hikari falls to the ground as if she'd been suspended unconscious in the air. She coughs, then draws in a sharp breath as she realizes everything has returned to normal.
[22-Mar-2014 01:56:30]  <IllFlower> Ayako, despite being in some discomfort of her own, rushes over to check on Hikari.
[22-Mar-2014 02:00:22]  <ponicalica> "Hikari, are you okay?"
[22-Mar-2014 02:02:04]  <Alicia> Hikari struggles onto her knees, slowly breathing in and out. "I'm... fine, Ayako. I'm fine. Thank you."
[22-Mar-2014 02:02:32]  <Alicia> Hikari stands up, looking around. "But I'm not even sure what to say about *that*."
[22-Mar-2014 02:02:46]  <IllFlower> Let me borrow that for a second.
[22-Mar-2014 02:03:37]  <ponicalica> hm?
[22-Mar-2014 02:03:56]  <IllFlower> Hikari points at a sparkling mass of tendril-like paths running from the center of the spell circle that Ayako crafted, before Emi's counter-charm kicked in.
[22-Mar-2014 02:05:03]  <IllFlower> The vines soon resolve themselves into what appears to be... a very complicated tangle of footprints, with names on top of each of the tracks.
[22-Mar-2014 02:05:47]  <IllFlower> Ayako immediately recognizes some of the names. Emi's, of course, and presumably those of her parents - but also Akiko's, Sanae's, and, most tellingly, Satsuki's...
[22-Mar-2014 02:08:09]  <IllFlower> This must be why Emi set up the counter-charm. Anyone who knew the right incantation would be able to trivially trace her whereabouts otherwise.
[22-Mar-2014 02:11:59]  <ponicalica> "Hmm.  Looks like this would allow us to trace both Emi and Satsuki."
[22-Mar-2014 02:14:18]  <ponicalica> "I guess the question is, who should we track down first?"
[22-Mar-2014 02:14:57]  <Alicia> "Sounds like we found what we needed. Emi, perhaps?"
[22-Mar-2014 02:16:55]  <IllFlower> Not Satsuki?
[22-Mar-2014 02:17:50]  <ponicalica> "Hmm, maybe, but what would we do?  It's hard to tell from one initiate's words but I don't think Emi's hands are entirely clean either.  But who's more dangerous, her or Satsuki?"
[22-Mar-2014 02:18:21]  <IllFlower> Well, we can go by the number of dead people they're each responsible for...
[22-Mar-2014 02:19:27]  <ponicalica> "...probably Satsuki."
[22-Mar-2014 02:19:29]  <IllFlower> You could justify going after Emi if you wanted to be ruthlessly pragmatic about it.
[22-Mar-2014 02:19:39]  <IllFlower> It's killing two birds with one stone!
[22-Mar-2014 02:19:57]  <IllFlower> Probably not the most morally justifiable thing to do, but hey, you are the law.
[22-Mar-2014 02:20:49]  <IllFlower> Not like anyone's going to call you on it if you get the job done.
[22-Mar-2014 02:23:19]  <Alicia> I have no issue with going after Emi.
[22-Mar-2014 02:23:28]  <Alicia> .... well, that is "if you get the job done." >_>;
[22-Mar-2014 02:23:32]  <Alicia> Hm.
[22-Mar-2014 02:25:12]  <Alicia> Though neither is a cakewalk, really.
[22-Mar-2014 02:25:37]  <IllFlower> Although that is kinda operating under the assumption that Satsuki's faction just tosses their hands up in the air, goes "oh, looks like she's dead," and renounce their violent ways.
[22-Mar-2014 02:26:06]  <Alicia> Yeah, lol, yeah right.
[22-Mar-2014 02:26:52]  <IllFlower> I mean, there's no reason not to believe that's the case.
[22-Mar-2014 02:27:02]  <IllFlower> Thought there's no reason to believe that it *is*.
