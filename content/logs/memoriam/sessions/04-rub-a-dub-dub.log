[01-Sep-2013 20:14:31]  <Ayako> launch?  But this is magical girls, not mecha!
[01-Sep-2013 20:14:42]  * Rig plugs in the launch key.
[01-Sep-2013 20:15:36]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> now i wonder what kinna security features jet fighters have.
[01-Sep-2013 20:15:41]  <IllFlower> Okay, where did we leave off last time...?
[01-Sep-2013 20:15:46]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> `-`
[01-Sep-2013 20:15:52]  <Rig> It's generally called being surrounded by guys with guns, Barcode[YANO_Hitomi].
[01-Sep-2013 20:15:53]  <Nitya> Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]: being surrounded by a military base
[01-Sep-2013 20:15:57]  <Ayako> IllFlower: we had just turned in Kazuto to whoever, I think
[01-Sep-2013 20:16:02]  * Nitya sliced into pieces, falls to ground
[01-Sep-2013 20:16:15]  <IllFlower> Ah, right, with Kazuto getting the stuffing beat out of him, and the name Kotomi Taniguchi.
[01-Sep-2013 20:16:16]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> oh yeah, and we were looking for The Lead.
[01-Sep-2013 20:16:19]  <Ayako> Nitya: not true.  sometimes it's surrounded by an aircraft carrier and a shitload of water
[01-Sep-2013 20:17:15]  <IllFlower> I imagine your characters would report in to their familiar at this point, but I just realized that means I'd have to name said familiar.
[01-Sep-2013 20:17:32]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Shizuko.
[01-Sep-2013 20:17:47]  <IllFlower> That's an abnormally normal name for a familiar...
[01-Sep-2013 20:17:57]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Schwarzbald.
[01-Sep-2013 20:18:12]  <Ayako> isn't "schwarzwald" the name for the black forest
[01-Sep-2013 20:18:35]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> also that one big o character. anyway it doesn't matter, if you'd prefer to get to the looking for her we can, unless we feel the familiar might have something interesting to say/do?

[01-Sep-2013 20:19:50]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> i think it sounds like 4 which sounds like death.

[01-Sep-2013 20:21:51]  <IllFlower> Anyway, given that the girls have no leads on exactly how to get to Kotomi, the familiar's as good a place as any, right?
[01-Sep-2013 20:22:07]  <Rig> I figure we could just keep punching Kazoo.
[01-Sep-2013 20:22:07]  <Ayako> yeah
[01-Sep-2013 20:22:21]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> unless you wanted to skip to finding her, yeah, that makes sense. it'd know where all the emgirls are at.

[01-Sep-2013 20:24:03]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ^
[01-Sep-2013 20:24:38]  <IllFlower> The girls report back to their familiar, somewhere deep inside the Conservators' lair.
[01-Sep-2013 20:25:00]  <IllFlower> By which I mean a room stacked full of papers and boxes in a disused downtown office building.
[01-Sep-2013 20:25:30]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> quite a step down from our library fortress.
[01-Sep-2013 20:25:48]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> A good thing, really. the conservators have their sense of value in the right place.

[01-Sep-2013 20:31:26]  <Ayako> "I suppose, but unfortunately the books are still stolen."
[01-Sep-2013 20:32:02]  <IllFlower> The familiar looks with concern at Jun and Hitomi, before turning to answer Ayako.
[01-Sep-2013 20:32:47]  <IllFlower> "Yes, that is true. There's no reason not to savor the small victories, though." **

[01-Sep-2013 20:36:51]  <IllFlower> The familiar makes an uneasy face.
[01-Sep-2013 20:37:10]  <IllFlower> "Two things," she says.

[01-Sep-2013 20:54:52]  <IllFlower> Okay, then let us teleport off to Typical Suburban High School #MC2857CL/A, where Kotomi Taniguchi's younger brother, Yuzuru, spends his weekdays.
[01-Sep-2013 20:55:15]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((Hitomi telefrags shub-niggurath.))
[01-Sep-2013 20:55:21]  <IllFlower> Let's say it's after school a day or so later. Even magical girls have to work with schedules.
[01-Sep-2013 20:55:34]  <Rig> How old is her brother?
[01-Sep-2013 20:55:43]  <IllFlower> Sixteen.
[01-Sep-2013 20:55:51]  <Ayako> so Ayako's age.
[01-Sep-2013 20:56:18]  <IllFlower> Indeed.
[01-Sep-2013 20:56:34]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Would we be, say, standing at the bus terminal? Or sneaking into the school before he leaves? (actually how do we know what he looks like)

[01-Sep-2013 20:56:57]  <Ayako> presumably the familiars have his picture
[01-Sep-2013 20:56:59]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[01-Sep-2013 20:57:46]  <IllFlower> I wouldn't object to just waltzing in the front gate. Imagine you've been helpfully provided with matching uniforms.
[01-Sep-2013 20:58:05]  <Rig> I think waltzing in the front gate sounds pretty damn subtle.
[01-Sep-2013 20:58:09]  <Rig> So, let's do that.
[01-Sep-2013 20:58:50]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> surely clothingmancy is within a familiar's powers. Hitomi tries to do her best awkward tall teenager impression.
[01-Sep-2013 20:59:19]  <Ayako> Ayako does her best awkward teenager impression, by which the narrator means that she is acting completely like herself.
[01-Sep-2013 20:59:56]  <IllFlower> There are, as always, a fair number of students and teachers milling about after classes.
[01-Sep-2013 20:59:57]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> (more seriously, yeah, hitomi just looks slightly uneasy, for disguise-related reasons.)
[01-Sep-2013 21:01:03]  <IllFlower> Most of them are engaged in the usual chit-chat. "Want to go to the cake shop?" "Did you see last night's episode?" "My sister just won't quit nagging me..."

[01-Sep-2013 21:18:03]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> "We could -" Hitomi gives up on disguising her voice and just decides whispering is easier. Does she even sound much different from the students...? "We could go investigate the shed, I guess. But we aught to let Jun know first..." Hitomi whispers to Ayako. Luckily, Jun seems to have arrived on time.
[01-Sep-2013 21:18:07]  <Rig> "Not used to being at school after hours, Hitomi?"

[01-Sep-2013 21:32:31]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi blinks, frozen. After a moment she looks behind her at the school again.
[01-Sep-2013 21:32:36]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> herself*
[01-Sep-2013 21:32:44]  <Rig> "Ugh, this isn't good."
[01-Sep-2013 21:33:07]  <Ayako> (fuck, where have I heard the name "Shirakawa")
[01-Sep-2013 21:33:17]  <Rig> Jun looks around to see if anyone else is around before stepping inside. "Help me get her down."
[01-Sep-2013 21:33:24]  <Ayako> (oh, it was the bank of japan guy :V)
[01-Sep-2013 21:34:24]  <IllFlower> There's no one else present, not for at least a hundred yards around in either direction.
[01-Sep-2013 21:35:03]  <IllFlower> Is anyone going to help Jun? :p
[01-Sep-2013 21:35:05]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi obliges, her normal dismissive calm coming over her again for the first time since they approached the high school. "What I'd do for a knife. What kinda kid comes up with knots like these?"
[01-Sep-2013 21:35:33]  <Ayako> Ayako, still a bit shaken, walks up to Jun to assist him in untying the unconscious girl.
[01-Sep-2013 21:35:37]  <Rig> Jun begins a conflict with the knots.
[01-Sep-2013 21:35:56]  * Barcode[YANO_Hitomi] scans for seriousness
[01-Sep-2013 21:35:58]  <IllFlower> Indeed, the knots are entirely too complicated for their own good, like a topology student's fever dream.
[01-Sep-2013 21:36:27]  <Rig> So, we get the girl down, and then try to wake her up.
[01-Sep-2013 21:36:34]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> yeh.
[01-Sep-2013 21:36:35]  <IllFlower> Just a moment.

[01-Sep-2013 21:38:12]  <Ayako> (the knots are complicated enough that they actually provide a counter-example to a well-known conjecture in knot theory
[01-Sep-2013 21:38:14]  <IllFlower> Shirakawa's eyes and mouth fly open, and an unearthly scream that sounds more bat than human rattles the shed. **

[01-Sep-2013 21:40:38]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi backs off, cursing, almost trapping Jun's wrist in the middle of a random noose. She looks the kid in the eyes, startled. "Hey! Easy! We're here to help..."
[01-Sep-2013 21:41:17]  <Ayako> Ayako stumbles away, looking to her fellow Conservators to see if they understand this situation any more than she does
[01-Sep-2013 21:41:32]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> For that matter. Anything weird with her eyes?
[01-Sep-2013 21:41:59]  <Rig> Jun falls backward into a stack of mats.
[01-Sep-2013 21:42:59]  <IllFlower> Flares of black and purple seem to emanate from Shirakawa's eyes for a moment, before whatever has gotten a hold of her releases her. She stops screaming as her body goes slack.
[01-Sep-2013 21:43:04]  *** Zia <~Zia@ip-64-134-142-143.public.wayport.net> has joined #madokamadness
[01-Sep-2013 21:43:21]  <IllFlower> She pants heavily, straining to get oxygen into her body while suspended upside-down. **
[01-Sep-2013 21:44:40]  <Rig> Jun reaches out into the magical energy around them and tries to trace the source of the possession quickly while trying to keep her eyes on the girl.
[01-Sep-2013 21:45:49]  <Ayako> Ayako slowly walks back to the girl, in an attempt to finish untying the convoluted set of knots still holding Shirakawa up.  "What was that?"
[01-Sep-2013 21:46:55]  <IllFlower> Jun's eyes trace back to a stack of plastic storage tubs in the corner of the shed. **
[01-Sep-2013 21:47:40]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi moves to try to calm the girl down in the meantime. Careful not to touch her again. "Hold on. We'll get you down in a second." Indeed, there aren't /too/ many knots left. Seems like Hitomi'll have to catch her, unfortunately.
[01-Sep-2013 21:48:03]  <Rig> "Looks like we've got company," Jun says. She approaches the plastic tubs cautiously.
[01-Sep-2013 21:49:09]  <IllFlower> Hitomi and Ayako manage to lower Shirakawa onto the mats, where the girl promptly collapses.
[01-Sep-2013 21:49:29]  <IllFlower> Rig: The tubs, being tubs, do not react. **
[01-Sep-2013 21:49:30]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((hard to stand on one's head, after all.))
[01-Sep-2013 21:49:59]  <Rig> Rig opens the tub on top, expecting a familiar to jump out.
[01-Sep-2013 21:50:14]  <Rig> *Jun
[01-Sep-2013 21:50:17]  <IllFlower> lol.
[01-Sep-2013 21:50:17]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> lol.
[01-Sep-2013 21:50:18]  <Rig> Brain skipped.
[01-Sep-2013 21:50:38]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi tries to analyze what the girl's condition exactly is. Having some experience in the field she should at least be able to recognise any remotely typical arcane influence.
[01-Sep-2013 21:51:04]  <Ayako> lol, at least it's not as bad as Fiora and Yuna, where I'm pretty sure everyone wrote Yuna's name "Fiora" at least once.
[01-Sep-2013 21:51:44]  <IllFlower> Something like an electrical spark courses through Jun as she tries to open the tub, knocking her back a fair distance. The lid seems to snap back shut on its own. **
[01-Sep-2013 21:52:06]  <Fiora> hi
[01-Sep-2013 21:52:45]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Nothing about Shirakawa's condition?
[01-Sep-2013 21:52:57]  <IllFlower> Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]: Shirakawa seems pretty normal. Aside from the part where she's out from having just screamed like the gates of hell had opened in her throat.
[01-Sep-2013 21:53:06]  <Rig> Jun ends up back on the mats and tries to shake off the stun. "Think I found something."
[01-Sep-2013 21:53:34]  <Ayako> "What did you find?"
[01-Sep-2013 21:53:46]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> So nothing easy to detect remaining in her, I guess.
[01-Sep-2013 21:53:52]  <IllFlower> Not at the moment.
[01-Sep-2013 21:54:07]  <Rig> "Dunno, it shocked me when I tried to open the tub over there."
[01-Sep-2013 21:55:51]  <Ayako> "Sounds like a magical protection spell to me.  I think I read about those; my notebook probably has something that would reverse it..."
[01-Sep-2013 21:56:16]  <IllFlower> Not a bad deduction.
[01-Sep-2013 21:56:22]  <Ayako> (as opposed to all those non-magical protection spells)
[01-Sep-2013 21:56:42]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi looks up as Jun lands, though her analysis of the girl thankfully finished just beforehand. Listening to the conversation, she nods. ((sorry, dunno, lol))
[01-Sep-2013 21:57:04]  <IllFlower> Combination locks are pretty mysterious things.
[01-Sep-2013 21:57:20]  <IllFlower> Be back in a second.
[01-Sep-2013 21:57:48]  <Rig> "You should do something about it, Ayako."
[01-Sep-2013 21:57:56]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((for the first time I'm kinda stumped. mostly because i don't want shirakawa here to do some zombie goast shit, though I'd like to hope Hitomi's experience has at least guaranteed that a "Nothing here, boss" deduction will keep the four of them safe.))
[01-Sep-2013 21:59:20]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((that and tubvestigation doesn't really necessitate three pairs of eyes))
[01-Sep-2013 21:59:48]  <Rig> You can always just stand on top of her.
[01-Sep-2013 21:59:55]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> that won't help with the breathing!
[01-Sep-2013 22:00:08]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> though yeah, could just keep an eye on her during this scene.
[01-Sep-2013 22:06:15]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> caution, I'll have to leave for dinner in like, ten minutes max.
[01-Sep-2013 22:06:19]  <IllFlower> You have my assurances that Shirakawa will remain incapacitated for the time being.
[01-Sep-2013 22:06:35]  <IllFlower> In fact, she seems entirely harmless.
[01-Sep-2013 22:07:41]  <Ayako> Ayako flips through the notebook, and finds what she believes to be a suitable counterspell.  (Now let's hope I haven't derailed anything)
[01-Sep-2013 22:07:44]  <IllFlower> (As for the past ten minutes, in the immortal words of Dr. Ian Malcolm, "When you gotta go, you gotta go.")
[01-Sep-2013 22:07:58]  <Ayako> (actually wait no, there was no **, so nevermind :V)
[01-Sep-2013 22:08:37]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> well, as far as derailing goes, again, dogs is supposed to be a fairly player-invovled game story-wise. but yeah, suppose we wait for the asterisksksks.
[01-Sep-2013 22:08:42]  <IllFlower> Ayako reads the spell, causing the tub to only throw off more sparks. **
[01-Sep-2013 22:09:54]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi looks flatly. "Wonder what'll happen if we try to whack them open." She peers at the tubs. Are they see-through?
[01-Sep-2013 22:10:09]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> looks on unimpressedly* whatever.

[01-Sep-2013 22:11:32]  <IllFlower> They're pretty opaque.
[01-Sep-2013 22:11:58]  <IllFlower> I guess there's no reason you can't try hitting them.
[01-Sep-2013 22:12:43]  <Rig> Couldn't Ayako start a conflict to dispel the protection?
[01-Sep-2013 22:12:47]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ^
[01-Sep-2013 22:12:54]  <IllFlower> Indeed she could.
[01-Sep-2013 22:13:01]  <IllFlower> Just waiting for the signal.
[01-Sep-2013 22:13:11]  * Rig fires a flare gun.
[01-Sep-2013 22:13:18]  <Ayako> What level would said conflict start at?
[01-Sep-2013 22:13:32]  <IllFlower> Since tubs don't make very good NPCs, this'll be a Demonic Influence conflict, at 4d6+4d10.
[01-Sep-2013 22:13:38]  * Barcode[YANO_Hitomi] looks at flare gun line, thinks of AoT
[01-Sep-2013 22:13:47]  <IllFlower> Level... well, you can't really talk to tubs, so we'll start at physical.
[01-Sep-2013 22:14:01]  <IllFlower> Bd+Ht, in other words.
[01-Sep-2013 22:14:09]  * Barcode[YANO_Hitomi] checks manual. forgets how demonic influence works
[01-Sep-2013 22:14:12]  <IllFlower> The stakes will be dispelling the enchantment.
[01-Sep-2013 22:14:19]  <IllFlower> Any objections?
[01-Sep-2013 22:14:27]  <Rig> Well, if Ayako is dispelling magic with magic shouldn't it start at magic?
[01-Sep-2013 22:14:32]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Don't think so, though I'd like to throw in the Rule of Three thing. presumably we could link up and all that.
[01-Sep-2013 22:14:48]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> it's like unreal tournament, but with teenagers.
[01-Sep-2013 22:15:24]  <Ayako> Rig: Well, magic I think means magical weapons, as in the equivalent of guns.
[01-Sep-2013 22:15:29]  <IllFlower> Rig: I was thinking I'd reserve that for actual magical opponents, as opposed to ordinarily non-magical things that have been enchanted.
[01-Sep-2013 22:15:35]  <Rig> No problem.
[01-Sep-2013 22:15:49]  <IllFlower> It seems bizarre to open up the possibility of d10 fallout trying to open a storage bucket.
[01-Sep-2013 22:16:02]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> heheh.
[01-Sep-2013 22:16:04]  <Rig> It sounds fun.
[01-Sep-2013 22:16:10]  <Rig> "You die to a bucket."
[01-Sep-2013 22:16:18]  <IllFlower> "The bucket eats you."
[01-Sep-2013 22:16:22]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Rig: think there's already a TF2 achievement called The Bucket Kicks You or whatever.
[01-Sep-2013 22:16:32]  <Rig> It's like a Mimic.
[01-Sep-2013 22:16:36]  <IllFlower> Perhaps.
[01-Sep-2013 22:16:54]  <IllFlower> Ayako: What say you?
[01-Sep-2013 22:17:07]  <Ayako> I'm mildly distracted, but it all sounds good.
[01-Sep-2013 22:17:43]  <Ayako> alright, my sister's family finally cleared the room
[01-Sep-2013 22:17:46]  <Ayako> so I'm ready
[01-Sep-2013 22:18:15]  <IllFlower> Well, I'll leave the opening venue at physical. If you feel the need to escalate to potentially lethal magic against a box, be my guest!
[01-Sep-2013 22:18:19]  * Barcode[YANO_Hitomi] flips through manual, frustratedly has no idea how this could work.

[01-Sep-2013 22:18:48]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Well yeah, but like, would this count as Ceremony, or?
[01-Sep-2013 22:18:59]  <IllFlower> No, you just See and Raise like normal.
[01-Sep-2013 22:19:06]  <IllFlower> I'd say Ayako ought to Raise first.

[01-Sep-2013 22:19:27]  <Ayako> Right, just collecting which dice to use.
[01-Sep-2013 22:19:47]  <IllFlower> Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]: It'll be a little more interesting than that, one hopes.

[01-Sep-2013 22:20:25]  <Ayako> Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]: I meant in terms of possessions and traits and such.
[01-Sep-2013 22:20:35]  <IllFlower> Ayako: 1223666.
[01-Sep-2013 22:23:11]  <Ayako> Since the simple counterspell failed to work, Ayako decides to open up her more complex magical toolbox.  She begins a soft chant, designed to weaken demonic influences.  Raise 36, leave 12266.
[01-Sep-2013 22:24:04]  <IllFlower> I'm going to pretend she lays hands on it in the process.
[01-Sep-2013 22:24:30]  <Ayako> That's an element of ceremony, yes?
[01-Sep-2013 22:24:51]  <IllFlower> Oh, I don't mean ceremonially, specifically.
[01-Sep-2013 22:24:55]  <IllFlower> Just that she touches it somehow.
[01-Sep-2013 22:25:14]  <IllFlower> The only real effect ceremony has is on fallout, and I doubt anyone cares if this box takes fallout.
[01-Sep-2013 22:25:30]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> aight.
[01-Sep-2013 22:25:44]  <Ayako> ah, okay, yeah
[01-Sep-2013 22:25:51]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> oh, i thought ceremony was "you add dice as you do things" too, isn't it?
[01-Sep-2013 22:26:02]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> oh, isn't ceremony also*
[01-Sep-2013 22:26:26]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> not that it applies here. this can wait
[01-Sep-2013 22:27:26]  <IllFlower> The crate's surface warps away from Ayako's hands, as if trying to avoid the effects of her spell. See 18. The plastic begins to froth and bubble, and a boiling heat rises underneath Ayako's palms. Raise 28, leave 2233.
[01-Sep-2013 22:27:49]  <IllFlower> Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]: No, the only dice that change are the fallout dice the opponent has to take for taking the blow, if that applies.
[01-Sep-2013 22:27:57]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> i see.
[01-Sep-2013 22:28:13]  <Ayako> Just to be clear, bringing in a costume and transforming is separate from escalating the conflict?
[01-Sep-2013 22:28:32]  <IllFlower> I don't see why not.
[01-Sep-2013 22:28:43]  <IllFlower> I assume you're going to use it to summon some kind of protection?
[01-Sep-2013 22:28:58]  <Ayako> Yeah.
[01-Sep-2013 22:29:05]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Costumes as a sort of protection layer's what i thought they'd be, at any rate.
[01-Sep-2013 22:29:07]  <IllFlower> No objections here.
[01-Sep-2013 22:29:08]  <Ayako> +roll 2d6
[01-Sep-2013 22:29:08]  <rollermine> Ayako: (1+3)=4

[01-Sep-2013 22:29:11]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ow.
[01-Sep-2013 22:29:16]  <Ayako> not that it actually helped.
[01-Sep-2013 22:29:24]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> well, 3's okay. just not super fancy.
[01-Sep-2013 22:29:41]  <Ayako> well actually
[01-Sep-2013 22:29:48]  <Ayako> 1122366
[01-Sep-2013 22:30:18]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> You'll need 3 dice anyway, but  the box won't have much left after that.
[01-Sep-2013 22:30:29]  <IllFlower> No, he can see 66.
[01-Sep-2013 22:30:32]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> oh right.
[01-Sep-2013 22:31:17]  * Barcode[YANO_Hitomi] stares at 2233. shonen stare panel
[01-Sep-2013 22:32:38]  <IllFlower> Ayako?
[01-Sep-2013 22:32:40]  <Ayako> Ayako, sensing danger, instinctively forms her magical costume...unfortunately for her, while it comes with a default layer of magical protection, it does not actually come with gloves.  See 136, leave 1226, take 3d6 fallout.
[01-Sep-2013 22:32:57]  <IllFlower> Works for me.
[01-Sep-2013 22:33:25]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Works for me, though I would imagine exposed skin in a costume wouldn't necessarily be your "weak points". (iunno, iwas thinking more "it scalds at you before you get to your costume)
[01-Sep-2013 22:33:47]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> or the heat gets through aethereally, of course.
[01-Sep-2013 22:33:56]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> complications. ignore me
[01-Sep-2013 22:34:08]  <Ayako> well, there's the magical protection still, so it's not full effects :p
[01-Sep-2013 22:34:21]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> true true.
[01-Sep-2013 22:35:32]  <IllFlower> Raise?
[01-Sep-2013 22:35:43]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> oh yeah >_<
[01-Sep-2013 22:35:53]  <Ayako> Yeah, was just pulling up a Latin dictionary for a word. :P
[01-Sep-2013 22:36:42]  <IllFlower> Taking this seriously, I see.
[01-Sep-2013 22:38:30]  <Ayako> She then, her hands pulled away from the now burning tub, moves into a forward pose.  "Gelum fac!" she shouts, her hand pointing towards the tub but not actually touching it this time.  Raise 16, leave 22.
[01-Sep-2013 22:38:55]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Alright, guest's over. getting a chair, should be able to run up and chekc results sporadically for the next 3 minutes or something
[01-Sep-2013 22:39:05]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> then i'll be back after eating.
[01-Sep-2013 22:39:19]  * IllFlower looks at dice
[01-Sep-2013 22:40:27]  <IllFlower> I give. The tub's lid pops off with a resounding crack, then promptly shatters into a million fragments upon hitting the ground.
[01-Sep-2013 22:40:36]  <IllFlower> Ayako: Roll your 3d6 fallout, then we'll continue.
[01-Sep-2013 22:40:43]  <Ayako> +roll 3d6
[01-Sep-2013 22:40:44]  <rollermine> Ayako: (1+6+3)=10
[01-Sep-2013 22:41:28]  <Ayako> is that...long-term fallout
[01-Sep-2013 22:41:30]  <Ayako> ?
[01-Sep-2013 22:41:37]  <IllFlower> 9. Long-term fallout.
[01-Sep-2013 22:41:47]  <IllFlower> Also one experience fallout item, for the 1 you rolled.
[01-Sep-2013 22:42:08]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> lol, you could add 1 and subtract 1 from one of your stats
[01-Sep-2013 22:42:34]  <Ayako> Well, for long-term fallout, I feel like the most thematically appropriate would be something with the costume, lol.
[01-Sep-2013 22:42:37]  <IllFlower> You can work out the details later - I imagine costume damage might be an appropriate fallout item.
[01-Sep-2013 22:43:03]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Oh! Your witch-y costume could have like ,scorch marks all along the bottom of the cloak part.
[01-Sep-2013 22:43:05]  <IllFlower> Meanwhile, Ayako peers into the tub to find... hm, I wonder.
[01-Sep-2013 22:43:31]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> as for experience you oughta do something like "I got into an hoenst-to-god somewhat-dangerous real-world magic situation or something, for improved confidence and what not.
[01-Sep-2013 22:43:35]  <Ayako> Yeah, I was figuring that it would have some scorching.
[01-Sep-2013 22:43:36]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> (do what you wnat in either case, of course.)
[01-Sep-2013 22:43:48]  <IllFlower> The answer is "books," by the way. Lots and lots of books.
[01-Sep-2013 22:44:16]  *** Saladofstones <~Saladofst@pool-70-104-149-221.lsanca.fios.verizon.net> has joined #madokamadness
[01-Sep-2013 22:44:49]  <Rig> "Looks like we found the books."
[01-Sep-2013 22:44:57]  <Rig> "But what do they have to do with this girl?"
[01-Sep-2013 22:45:27]  <IllFlower> Only some of them, it looks like. A few of the books on the list are missing.
[01-Sep-2013 22:45:49]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> Hitomi thinks. "Right now I"m wondering if we should take her to the nurse or take her somewhere till we can ask her about all this..."
[01-Sep-2013 22:46:06]  <IllFlower> Conveniently enough, Shirakawa begins to stir. Maybe the commotion awakened her.
[01-Sep-2013 22:46:09]  <IllFlower> **
[01-Sep-2013 22:46:18]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> "Oh! How convenient."
[01-Sep-2013 22:46:31]  <Ayako> "Perhaps we should send someone back with the books, at least.  Maybe Hitomi, since she seems rather nervous about being on school grounds..."
[01-Sep-2013 22:46:47]  <Ayako> (and needs to eat dinner, so here's an in-story excuse for her absence)
[01-Sep-2013 22:46:54]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((heheh.))
[01-Sep-2013 22:47:33]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> "...Reasonable." She starts stuffing them in her bag.
[01-Sep-2013 22:47:36]  <Ayako> (Shirakawa: "Ayako, are you a cosplayer?")
[01-Sep-2013 22:47:43]  <IllFlower> (Isn't it always the case that the unconscious hostage wakes up immediately after the action is over, though?)
[01-Sep-2013 22:48:09]  <Barcode[YANO_Hitomi]> ((alright yeah i'll be back. thereis the whole gameplay-without-someone thing but if yall are strsapped for time/don't feel like waiting 30-60 minutes for me to get back i won't take offense))
[01-Sep-2013 22:48:30]  <Rig> I'd appreciate it if we could wrap it up.
[01-Sep-2013 22:48:42]  <Rig> I need to go visit my grandmother and pick people up from the airport.
[01-Sep-2013 22:48:45]  <IllFlower> Yeah, we're going to run this to a close.
[01-Sep-2013 22:49:25]  <IllFlower> Shirakawa looks around the interior of the shed, wide-eyed.
[01-Sep-2013 22:50:16]  <IllFlower> Her eyes seem to skip right over Ayako's costumed figure, as if it's of no remark, but she seizes up when she sees the opened tub with what appears to be steam pouring out of the top. **
[01-Sep-2013 22:51:10]  <Rig> Jun follows Shirakawa's gaze. "Know something about that?"
[01-Sep-2013 22:51:52]  <IllFlower> Shirakawa struggles to put together a sentence. "What - what happened...? Why is there...?" **
[01-Sep-2013 22:53:33]  <Rig> Jun tries to tone down the accusations. The girl was just suspended upside down and doing her best impression of a bat. "Okay, it's okay. What's the last thing you remember?"
[01-Sep-2013 22:54:54]  <IllFlower> "I - I was leaving school, and then I... I don't remember much after that...
[01-Sep-2013 22:55:18]  <IllFlower> "Who are you? I've never seen you before, even though you're wearing our uniform..." **
[01-Sep-2013 22:57:50]  <Rig> "I'm, uh, new. A transfer…" Jun sort of trails off. "I was looking for Yuzuru. Do you know him?" Jun asks, trying to drive the conversation somewhere else.
[01-Sep-2013 22:57:51]  <Ayako> "We're here to help.  You were hanging upside down when we fonud you."
[01-Sep-2013 23:01:00]  <IllFlower> "Yuzuru...? Taniguchi? I know his sister, but -" Shirakawa abruptly stops short. **
[01-Sep-2013 23:01:29]  <Ayako> "Kotomi?"
[01-Sep-2013 23:02:04]  *** SpruceZeus is now known as SpruceZeus|away
[01-Sep-2013 23:02:05]  <IllFlower> "Kotomi... are you friends of hers?" **
[01-Sep-2013 23:02:27]  <Rig> Jun shrugs. "Kind of."
[01-Sep-2013 23:03:26]  <IllFlower> "K-kind of... I see." She fixes her gaze on the tub, which has by now stopped smoking. "H-have you seen her lately, or...?"
[01-Sep-2013 23:03:34]  <IllFlower> **
[01-Sep-2013 23:03:52]  <Rig> "We were looking for her actually."
[01-Sep-2013 23:04:55]  <IllFlower> Shirakawa looks at Jun with wide eyes for a second, then down at the mats below her.
[01-Sep-2013 23:05:47]  <IllFlower> "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't know, I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry -" she starts muttering tremulously. **
[01-Sep-2013 23:07:11]  <Ayako> "It's okay.  We're just worried."
[01-Sep-2013 23:08:38]  <IllFlower> The girl turns to look at Ayako. Maybe her fear response has finally kicked in, but one look and she begins backing away from the costumed figure.
[01-Sep-2013 23:08:51]  *** SpruceZeus|away is now known as SpruceZeus
[01-Sep-2013 23:08:56]  <IllFlower> "You're coming for - for me, aren't you? I don't know, I don't know..." **
[01-Sep-2013 23:10:47]  <Ayako> "I'm not sure how much we're going to get from her, Jun."
[01-Sep-2013 23:10:57]  <Saladofstones> ((its a trap))
[01-Sep-2013 23:11:31]  <Rig> Jun holds out her hands flat with the palms up. "We're not coming for anyone," she says. Ayako is probably right. This girl doesn't have any information that she can give them.
[01-Sep-2013 23:12:14]  <Rig> Something is definitely happening here, but the direct approach isn't solving things.
[01-Sep-2013 23:12:23]  <Rig> Jun wants to do a stakeout.
[01-Sep-2013 23:13:24]  <IllFlower> That would be an interesting conflict.
[01-Sep-2013 23:13:38]  <IllFlower> I think we'll have to wait to do anything like that until the next session, though.
[01-Sep-2013 23:13:46]  <IllFlower> Considering you do have to be on your way and everything.
[01-Sep-2013 23:13:54]  <Rig> Yeah.
[01-Sep-2013 23:14:06]  <Rig> But I think it may be time to be a bit sneaky and indirect.
[01-Sep-2013 23:14:20]  <IllFlower> Sounds like a plan.
[01-Sep-2013 23:14:24]  <Ayako> A stakeout could be fun, but yeah, this is probably a good stopping point.
[01-Sep-2013 23:14:45]  <IllFlower> All right. We'll wrap for today. Apologies for the slow pace.
[01-Sep-2013 23:15:01]  <IllFlower> I think I'll have time to continue next weekend. I'll keep you guys posted.
[01-Sep-2013 23:15:08]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, guys.
