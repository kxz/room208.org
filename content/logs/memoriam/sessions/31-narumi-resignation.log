@time=2014-08-10T20:08:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So what's the plan?

@time=2014-08-10T20:12:07.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We told the initiates we would do that.

@time=2014-08-10T20:12:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We never agreed on anything.
@time=2014-08-10T20:12:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I thought lying was supposed to be a last resort for Kazuki. ;)
@time=2014-08-10T20:13:01.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It was a last resort.
@time=2014-08-10T20:13:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Greater good and all that.
@time=2014-08-10T20:13:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We'll say that she left you a way to contact her. Simple enough.
@time=2014-08-10T20:13:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You can pick the place.
@time=2014-08-10T20:14:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let’s go with Shii’s office.
@time=2014-08-10T20:14:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Probably without Shii there.
@time=2014-08-10T20:14:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The pews again?
@time=2014-08-10T20:14:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She’s off doing familiar things.
@time=2014-08-10T20:14:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :lol.
@time=2014-08-10T20:14:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sure, why introduce new settings?
@time=2014-08-10T20:14:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :30 named settings!

@time=2014-08-10T20:15:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The office is empty when the Conservators arrive. Shii must have been called out on other business.
@time=2014-08-10T20:16:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Narumi shows up about fifteen minutes after she gets the call, in costume this time. She's either been on magical assignment, or picked up on the hint from last time.
@time=2014-08-10T20:17:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Is there news?" she asks.
@time=2014-08-10T20:17:21.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, who is here?
@time=2014-08-10T20:17:28.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari and Kazuki?
@time=2014-08-10T20:17:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako's gone.
@time=2014-08-10T20:17:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Is Rin off stewing in a corner?
@time=2014-08-10T20:18:03.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :or something
@time=2014-08-10T20:18:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe she and Ayako are stewing together, who knows.
@time=2014-08-10T20:18:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, yes, it looks like it's just Kazuki and Hikari in the office.
@time=2014-08-10T20:19:21.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki leans against Shii’s desk and puts on his best sympathetic face. “I’m sorry, Narumi. It’s not good news.”
@time=2014-08-10T20:20:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I thought as much," Narumi says with a resigned tone.
@time=2014-08-10T20:20:52.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin's probably off scouting for locations for a ceremony she thinks is going to happen
@time=2014-08-10T20:20:54.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“Pyunpyun is rather set on not allowing a ceremony. And in all honesty, he is in accordance with the Order’s wishes on this.”
@time=2014-08-10T20:21:14.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :there's no way this whole lying thing isn't going to blow up in our faces, is there
@time=2014-08-10T20:21:49.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki sighs. “You know that you can’t do anything magical for your sister’s memorial, but you’re allowed to participate in any other ways of remembering her, right?”
@time=2014-08-10T20:22:17.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(ponicalica: Smooth, Kazuki.)
@time=2014-08-10T20:23:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I do." Narumi looks straight at Kazuki for a moment or two, wordlessly stating the caveats.
@time=2014-08-10T20:24:41.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki meets her gaze. “If you go against the Order on this you understand what will happen, don’t you?”
@time=2014-08-10T20:25:54.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Perhaps another conflict is in order, Kazuki v Narumi: The Bout of the Century
@time=2014-08-10T20:26:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Narumi leaves room for a long silence.
@time=2014-08-10T20:27:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That won't be necessary," she finally says. "Sorry to have taken your time."
@time=2014-08-10T20:27:12.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Good job.)
@time=2014-08-10T20:27:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki nods. “Sorry we couldn’t be more help.”

@time=2014-08-10T20:29:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"No. I shouldn't have expected anything else," Narumi says. Her eyes are glassy, as if her mind has already left without her.
@time=2014-08-10T20:30:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Good-bye, then."
@time=2014-08-10T20:31:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki doesn’t say anything as the girl leaves. He waits until he’s sure she’s out of earshot and then turns to Hikari. “We should probably follow her, right?”
@time=2014-08-10T20:32:50.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yes, we should. She already seems unstable, and our attempts to help certainly haven't fostered any progress."
@time=2014-08-10T20:34:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“I swear we have more cultists in the Order than actual initiates,” Kazuki mutters under his breath. “Yeah, let’s go.”
@time=2014-08-10T20:35:04.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :kazuki decides the entire Order is corrupt, burns it all to the ground
@time=2014-08-10T20:35:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Their minds made up, the two Conservators trail out of Shii's office and down into the passageways along the side of the former church's main hall.
@time=2014-08-10T20:35:23.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Honestly, I'm mildly surprised Kazuki's speaking to her normally, instead of just being all "So, we're doing this, aight?" :p

@time=2014-08-10T20:47:58.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I have a ridiculous and hilarious idea.

@time=2014-08-10T20:49:34.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That is in Rin's character.
@time=2014-08-10T20:50:17.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, that's actually what I was thinking
@time=2014-08-10T20:50:26.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And I do like me some Conservator infighting.
@time=2014-08-10T20:50:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, it's up to Rin to make that phone call, isn't it?
@time=2014-08-10T20:50:55.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Er. Not fighting, mind.
@time=2014-08-10T20:51:36.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :When should Ayako show up, btw?
@time=2014-08-10T20:52:24.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe she's tailing Hikari and Kazuki, because she doubts Kazuki could be up to anything good.
@time=2014-08-10T20:52:30.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And she just shows up there.
@time=2014-08-10T20:52:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Whenever. I think we can safely call that enough scene time has passed.
@time=2014-08-10T20:53:30.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also, we sure do tail people a lot...
@time=2014-08-10T20:53:42.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alright.  So we basically just have to find a good way to fit her in?
@time=2014-08-10T20:53:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Either way, if anyone tails Narumi, she does actually just go straight home. So unless you guys want to try barging into her house, I think that line of inquiry has petered out.
@time=2014-08-10T20:54:32.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, what do we know about Hatsue’s cult?
@time=2014-08-10T20:54:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Like anything solid or just “she was a cult leader"

@time=2014-08-10T20:56:29.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think all that's known by anyone is that Hatsue was doing some sort of experiment and it backfired?
@time=2014-08-10T20:56:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: They got a little too curious and started using magic they were too inexperienced to handle. By the time witches got involved, they were in too deep to know how to back out. Nothing too complicated.
@time=2014-08-10T20:57:01.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And are any other members known?
@time=2014-08-10T20:57:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin flips the bird to Kazuki, walks off.
@time=2014-08-10T20:57:56.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :If the tailing petered out, then they should probably regroup, and then "Where's Rin?" etc
