[06-Sep-2014 19:04:41]  * BGTB2005 collects 5d8 from another room
[06-Sep-2014 19:04:55]  <IllFlower> So last time, Ayako was busy getting involved in a fistfight in the middle of a restaurant.
[06-Sep-2014 19:05:11]  <Rig> Yes, I remember that.
[06-Sep-2014 19:05:32]  <ponicalica> She punched Youichi, and then Ritsuko slapped her
[06-Sep-2014 19:05:59]  <Alicia> Meanwhile, Hikari and Kazuki were doing nothing.
[06-Sep-2014 19:06:05]  <IllFlower> Meanwhile, Kazuki and Hikari are outside on the curb, smoking cigarettes and exchanging humorous anecdotes.
[06-Sep-2014 19:06:33]  <Alicia> "Haha, man, I thought I really hated you. Nah, you're just a prat." "You too."
[06-Sep-2014 19:06:39]  <ponicalica> cigarettes?  I didn't know that Hitomi was back
[06-Sep-2014 19:06:51]  <Rig> Everyone smokes in Japan.
[06-Sep-2014 19:08:10]  <IllFlower> So what's the plan, smoking man in Japan?
[06-Sep-2014 19:08:41]  *** Saladofstones <~What@199.107.223.57> has joined #madokamadness
[06-Sep-2014 19:08:49]  <Rig> Lemme skim the last couple bits of the logs.
[06-Sep-2014 19:09:22]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: sorry for late response but glad to hear things went well
[06-Sep-2014 19:09:30]  <IllFlower> And both the smoking and non-smoking women, I suppose.
[06-Sep-2014 19:09:40]  <Rig> I don’t think there is much for Kazuki to do here.
[06-Sep-2014 19:09:49]  <Rig> Unless you want to throw a girl out a window.
[06-Sep-2014 19:09:51]  <ponicalica> I think I should give Kazuki/Hikari time to decide whether they heard anything and come in before jumping into conflict
[06-Sep-2014 19:09:57]  <IllFlower> Shouldn't have split up the group, man.
[06-Sep-2014 19:10:25]  <Alicia> I dunno, can't Kazuki, like, sense this stuff?
[06-Sep-2014 19:10:30]  <Rig> Why not have the two of us outside see the fight break out, stomp our cigs out and storm inside. Guns drawn.
[06-Sep-2014 19:10:45]  <Alicia> I'm down for us barging in, magics ablazing.
[06-Sep-2014 19:10:46]  <IllFlower> I figure Kazuki just gets impatient and storms in.
[06-Sep-2014 19:10:49]  <IllFlower> That's kind of his style.
[06-Sep-2014 19:10:50]  <Alicia> Except not actually blazing.
[06-Sep-2014 19:10:51]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[06-Sep-2014 19:10:52]  <Saladofstones> and this is when snezana makes a surprise appearence
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:07]  <ponicalica> Saladofstones: pyunpyun is involved, so it's not impossible
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:12]  <IllFlower> "YOU'RE FUCKING THINGS UP AGAIN AREN'T YOU GODDAMN IT"
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:14]  <Saladofstones> rule a d6 to see if a serbian randomly enters the fray
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:28]  <ponicalica> Yui and Yuna retired though
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:30]  <IllFlower> Okay, so let's do that.
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:30]  <BGTB2005> +roll d6
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:31]  <Rig> “This is talking too long, Hikari.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:31]  <rollermine> BGTB2005: 6=6
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:39]  <Saladofstones> welp time for serbia I guess
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:50]  <Rig> *takign
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:52]  <Rig> fuck
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:57]  <Saladofstones> takingg
[06-Sep-2014 19:11:58]  <Rig> I typed too much on my essay
[06-Sep-2014 19:12:04]  <Saladofstones> taking*

[06-Sep-2014 19:12:22]  <Rig> *nginx
[06-Sep-2014 19:12:31]  <IllFlower> *Apache
[06-Sep-2014 19:12:33]  <Saladofstones> query(help)
[06-Sep-2014 19:12:38]  <Alicia> "Very well, Kazuki. I'm rather concerned about Ayako, anyway, she hasn't been too well..."
[06-Sep-2014 19:12:41]  <Alicia> Alice*
[06-Sep-2014 19:13:58]  <Rig> “Let’s go make sure they’re not killing each other.” Kazuki says, stomping out his cigarette. “Again,” he mutters.
[06-Sep-2014 19:14:29]  <Alicia> (Freaking litterer.)
[06-Sep-2014 19:14:46]  <IllFlower> And then Kazuki was an embittered police inspector from some J-drama.
[06-Sep-2014 19:14:48]  <BGTB2005> so punish him
[06-Sep-2014 19:14:50]  <Rig> (Hikari tackles Kazuki for justice)
[06-Sep-2014 19:15:04]  <Rig> Like this wasn’t a J-drama.
[06-Sep-2014 19:15:06]  <Alicia> (Nah, just slap him later.)
[06-Sep-2014 19:15:08]  <Rig> From the start.
[06-Sep-2014 19:15:25]  <Saladofstones> roll d100, odd numbers are multipled by a hundred and you must pay that fine to the police or suffer consequences
[06-Sep-2014 19:15:37]  <BGTB2005> (So no tackling and handcuffing for improper disposal of cigarette butts?)
[06-Sep-2014 19:16:00]  <ponicalica> that's just secular law, not important magical law
[06-Sep-2014 19:16:19]  <Saladofstones> separation of meguca and state hasn't hit yet yo
[06-Sep-2014 19:16:29]  <Alicia> (Later, BGTB2005, later!)
[06-Sep-2014 19:16:39]  <IllFlower> Kazuki steps in to see the entire restaurant staring in Ayako and Rin's direction, thus basically confirming his initial fears. Oh, and Ayako's on the ground holding her cheek in pain. Wonderful.
[06-Sep-2014 19:17:01]  <Rig> This truly was handled in a subtle way.
[06-Sep-2014 19:17:15]  *** Saladofstones is now known as monthly
[06-Sep-2014 19:17:20]  <Rig> No one is at all suspicious about girls fighting in what appears to be a Japanese diner.
[06-Sep-2014 19:17:28]  <ponicalica> that's what happens when you bring in Rin and Ayako, and Ayako's all witchy
[06-Sep-2014 19:17:34]  *** monthly is now known as monthlysaladstonekun
[06-Sep-2014 19:18:55]  <Rig> So, should we ask to take it outside?
[06-Sep-2014 19:19:17]  <Rig> Or should Kazuki be demanding as hell and basically arrest all of you?
[06-Sep-2014 19:19:26]  <Rig> Cuff ‘em Hikari!
[06-Sep-2014 19:19:32]  <IllFlower> I want to see Kazuki physically drag Rin outside.
[06-Sep-2014 19:19:35]  <Alicia> We should take it outside for Kazuki to be demanding as hell.
[06-Sep-2014 19:19:47]  <Alicia> While Hikari wrangles out and berates the initiates.
[06-Sep-2014 19:20:33]  <ponicalica> Is Rin the problem here? I guess now that Ayako's on the ground, maybe
[06-Sep-2014 19:21:29]  <Rig> Yeah, Ayako is the one that threw a punch.
[06-Sep-2014 19:21:34]  <Rig> Anyway, might as well get something going.
[06-Sep-2014 19:21:34]  <IllFlower> Anyway, Kazuki's not yelling yet. Pick up the pace.
[06-Sep-2014 19:21:36]  <BGTB2005> Given her reputation, I don't think anyone would believe Rin when she says she didn't start this one
[06-Sep-2014 19:21:51]  <Alicia> Well isn't that just great.
[06-Sep-2014 19:22:33]  <Rig> Kazuki strides up to the group of very angry looking girls. “I’m glad that you can consistently prove me right. How about we take this outside?”
[06-Sep-2014 19:23:56]  <Alicia> Hikari follows, in just as much of a huff as Kazuki. "You all are coming out with us, right now."
[06-Sep-2014 19:24:48]  <Rig> Hikari and Kazuki: Magical Police People
[06-Sep-2014 19:26:07]  <ponicalica> Ayako slowly comes up to her feet.  "And are we going to drag the cultists outside too, or just ignore them?", she whispers to Hikari
[06-Sep-2014 19:27:03]  <Alicia> "They're coming with us, now." Hikari mutters back.
[06-Sep-2014 19:30:09]  <IllFlower> Oh, I thought you guys would be doing a little more.
[06-Sep-2014 19:30:27]  <Rig> Do you want us to physically drag them out?
[06-Sep-2014 19:30:32]  <IllFlower> Right now the other three are just kind of staring at the Conservators dumbfounded.
[06-Sep-2014 19:30:50]  <Rig> Lemme find the list of all the people we’re staring at right now.
[06-Sep-2014 19:30:53]  <IllFlower> I mean, nobody's actually said anything to them.
[06-Sep-2014 19:30:54]  * monthlysaladstonekun is a random bystander who walks through the door with cup in hand, sees the scene, then walks out quietly
[06-Sep-2014 19:31:12]  <IllFlower> That's Youichi Nagatsuka, Miu Kanda, and Ritsuko Yonezawa.
[06-Sep-2014 19:31:30]  <ponicalica> monthlysaladstonekun: Walking into a restaurant with cup in hand_
[06-Sep-2014 19:32:17]  <monthlysaladstonekun> ponicalica, a lot of places apparantely allow you to walk in with your own cup for water
[06-Sep-2014 19:32:19]  <monthlysaladstonekun> since reusable
[06-Sep-2014 19:32:38]  <Alicia> Hikari looks to the other initiates. "Well, Nagatsuka, Kanda, and Yonezawa? Are you three going to leave easily or not?" Hikari eyes Rin, making sure she's ready to force them out.
[06-Sep-2014 19:34:26]  <IllFlower> "Leave?" Youichi answers mockingly. "Do you want our table? I know it's a little full."
[06-Sep-2014 19:35:29]  <Rig> Kazuki grins at the boy. “Well, you should settle your bill first.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:36:08]  <Alicia> (I'm almost ready for Hikari to do something rash, and basically force him  and the others out, MAYBE at the risk of pissing off Kazuki, even though she wouldn't like try to kill them.)
[06-Sep-2014 19:36:10]  <Rig> “I know you have a habit of dining and dashing.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:36:19]  <Alicia> (I don't want to cause a fight here though.)
[06-Sep-2014 19:36:54]  <IllFlower> Rig: Is that supposed to be a reference to something?
[06-Sep-2014 19:37:13]  <Rig> Leaving the Order without their powers being revoked.
[06-Sep-2014 19:37:15]  <Rig> I guess.
[06-Sep-2014 19:37:41]  <Alicia> Hikari sighs, exasperated. She looks to Kazuki, to see how ready he is to force something.
[06-Sep-2014 19:37:47]  <IllFlower> Youichi hands Kazuki a few thousand-yen bills.
[06-Sep-2014 19:37:54]  <IllFlower> "That ought to be enough."
[06-Sep-2014 19:38:55]  <IllFlower> He grimaces for a moment, grasping his stomach in apparent pain, but recovers quickly enough.
[06-Sep-2014 19:39:01]  <Rig> “Cute,” Kazuki says, dropping them on the table.
[06-Sep-2014 19:39:12]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@182.55.189.100> has left #madokamadness
[06-Sep-2014 19:39:45]  <Rig> “If you’re done here then you should come with us, we have some unfinished business with the Order.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:40:55]  <IllFlower> Ritsuko cuts in. "Forgive us if we're not exactly eager to follow your lead.
[06-Sep-2014 19:41:09]  <IllFlower> "Seeing as how last time that didn't pan out so well."
[06-Sep-2014 19:41:29]  <ponicalica> (I feel like Ayako should be more talkative but I'm not quite sure what she should say :V)
[06-Sep-2014 19:42:02]  <IllFlower> (Punch a bystander. Just 'cause.)
[06-Sep-2014 19:43:29]  <Rig> “And one lie deserves another, right?” Kazuki asks. “You said you wanted out, but you don’t want to give up the power, right?”
[06-Sep-2014 19:45:18]  <IllFlower> "I don't see why we should put our magic at the mercy of a mendacious system."
[06-Sep-2014 19:46:47]  <Rig> Kazuki takes the lone empty seat at the table. “Look, the system isn’t wrong. I was. The Order didn’t lie to you. I did.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:46:54]  <ponicalica> "The system, despite attempts to corrupt it, is the guard against your own magic falling to corruption."
[06-Sep-2014 19:47:46]  <IllFlower> "But you represent the system."
[06-Sep-2014 19:47:54]  <Rig> “So do you."
[06-Sep-2014 19:47:57]  <IllFlower> Miu, who's been mostly silent up to this point, suddenly chips in.
[06-Sep-2014 19:48:21]  <IllFlower> "Not any more, we don't."
[06-Sep-2014 19:48:32]  <Rig> “No, you still do.” Kazuki says.
[06-Sep-2014 19:48:45]  <Rig> “Remember that contract? That wish? The powers that you control?”
[06-Sep-2014 19:48:58]  <Rig> “All of that is a part of this system. It’s all part of the Order.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:49:35]  <Alicia> "You really don't understand the position you're in, do you, Youichi? You take the pledge to work with the Order, and fight for what's right - only for you and your friends to turn away when it doesn't fit what you want." Hikari responds, anger rising with every word. "You truly think you, some initiates, know better than the Order? If you don't have even the most minute amount of Faith in the system, then you should leave - pro
[06-Sep-2014 19:49:56]  <ponicalica> leave - pro
[06-Sep-2014 19:50:05]  <Alicia> properly!"*
[06-Sep-2014 19:50:09]  <IllFlower> "What do you think we're doing, exactly?
[06-Sep-2014 19:50:16]  <IllFlower> "We *are* leaving. Just not on your terms."
[06-Sep-2014 19:50:18]  <Alicia> (Sorry, I didn't think it'd cut off.)
[06-Sep-2014 19:50:37]  <Rig> “You’re running away with stolen goods. You’re living up to exactly what the prophets expected.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:50:46]  <Rig> “You’re justifying my lie.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:50:56]  <ponicalica> "You still have your magical powers, granted by the Order.  You haven't left, you've merely become corrupted."
[06-Sep-2014 19:52:29]  <IllFlower> "Then so be it. Nobody ever said dissidents had to be unpredictable."
[06-Sep-2014 19:54:31]  <Rig> Kazuki stands up from the table and takes a few steps away. “All right then. So be it.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:55:21]  <ponicalica> aren't we still in the restaurant
[06-Sep-2014 19:55:30]  <Rig> Yes.
[06-Sep-2014 19:55:47]  <Rig> So, we need to either drag them out or get everyone else to leave.
[06-Sep-2014 19:55:54]  <Rig> Or we can walk out and wait for them.
[06-Sep-2014 19:56:18]  <Alicia> Hikari turns to face Kazuki. "What are you...?"
[06-Sep-2014 19:57:06]  <ponicalica> get rin to attack a sprinkler, set off a fire alarm
[06-Sep-2014 19:58:14]  <Rig> “I’m done. If they want to run away and die for some little girl who got it in her head that she could control witches then they can do so. They seem to understand how pointless their dissent is. They couldn’t even do it properly. They hid it in an alley and came and got coffee at this little restaraunt.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:58:43]  <Rig> Kazuki smiles at the group, “You really made a statement.”
[06-Sep-2014 19:59:08]  *** WildSeraph <~Spheraph@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[06-Sep-2014 19:59:13]  <ponicalica> "So you're just going to let them walk away?"
[06-Sep-2014 19:59:59]  <Rig> “I’m going to let them finish their last meal.”
[06-Sep-2014 20:00:05]  <IllFlower> "Better that than living a liar," Youichi answers, unperturbed.
[06-Sep-2014 20:00:19]  <Rig> Kazuki walks out.
[06-Sep-2014 20:00:41]  <IllFlower> Mic drop 1d6
[06-Sep-2014 20:02:08]  <IllFlower> A long silence ensues.
[06-Sep-2014 20:02:40]  <Alicia> "How polite of him." She mutters. "Ayako, what do you make of these few?"
[06-Sep-2014 20:03:59]  <ponicalica> "Kazuki wants to give them a last meal.  I suppose we can give them that, whatever the hell he's planning."
[06-Sep-2014 20:04:33]  <IllFlower> I'd like to know myself!
[06-Sep-2014 20:04:58]  <Rig> Murder!
[06-Sep-2014 20:05:16]  <ponicalica> is he going to blow up the restaurant
[06-Sep-2014 20:05:17]  <Rig> Or rather he’s going to wait until they leave and then apprehend the criminals.
[06-Sep-2014 20:05:26]  <IllFlower> By murdering them.
[06-Sep-2014 20:05:32]  <Rig> Hopefully not.
[06-Sep-2014 20:06:01]  <Alicia> "You t-" Hikari begins, before cutting herself off. "Rin. Do something, please." She motions to the fire alarm.
[06-Sep-2014 20:06:35]  <Alicia> (Hikari, the type of person to ask and still not be happy with the response.)
[06-Sep-2014 20:08:34]  <IllFlower> PAGING RIN AMEMIYA TO THE RED COURTESY PHONE, RIN AMEMIYA
[06-Sep-2014 20:08:43]  <BGTB2005> "I've got a plan..." Rin answers, looking for the restrooms
[06-Sep-2014 20:08:59]  <Rig> Set fire to the restaraunt is not a plan. :P
[06-Sep-2014 20:09:11]  <BGTB2005> it is in Rin's mind
[06-Sep-2014 20:09:35]  <IllFlower> IT'S TIME TO PUSH THE BUTTON
[06-Sep-2014 20:09:49]  <BGTB2005> wait what button

[06-Sep-2014 20:10:08]  <IllFlower> I assume the fire alarm button.
[06-Sep-2014 20:11:15]  <ponicalica> aren't fire alarms usually things you pull or is it different in Japan
[06-Sep-2014 20:11:56]  <Alicia> Rin can just set fire to something. Not a whole something, mind.

[06-Sep-2014 20:13:01]  <ponicalica> just set fire to an empty chair or something
[06-Sep-2014 20:13:03]  <IllFlower> If you irritate the fire department they will water-cannon you guys.
[06-Sep-2014 20:13:58]  <Alicia> Set fire to their table.
[06-Sep-2014 20:14:29]  <ponicalica> I feel like Rin is probably a constant irritant to the fire department
[06-Sep-2014 20:14:54]  <Rig> You can actually determine when Rin became an emgirl by the increased number of calls to the fire department.
[06-Sep-2014 20:15:17]  <ponicalica> ("This weird girl with messy hair is constantly at the places we get called to, but whenever we try to charge her we get strong-armed by a weird cultish nonprofit")
[06-Sep-2014 20:15:26]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[06-Sep-2014 20:17:01]  <IllFlower> Seriously, what's going on?
[06-Sep-2014 20:17:15]  <Rig> I dunno.
[06-Sep-2014 20:17:39]  <IllFlower> Getting the civilian authorities involved is probably more trouble than it's worth.
[06-Sep-2014 20:18:05]  <IllFlower> The cultists probably won't be sitting around in there forever, so waiting is always an option.
[06-Sep-2014 20:18:09]  <Rig> I’m still up for just waiting.
[06-Sep-2014 20:18:18]  <Alicia> Hikari doesn't want to wait, because Hikari.
[06-Sep-2014 20:18:28]  <Rig> Or setting a trap
[06-Sep-2014 20:18:31]  <Alicia> But she's also not yet ready to punch them out(side).
[06-Sep-2014 20:18:55]  <IllFlower> Why don't we stage a conflict?
[06-Sep-2014 20:19:09]  <Rig> Sure.
[06-Sep-2014 20:19:10]  <Alicia> I'm up for it. Let's bring them in.
[06-Sep-2014 20:19:19]  <ponicalica> I'm up for a conflict.
[06-Sep-2014 20:19:25]  <BGTB2005> sure
[06-Sep-2014 20:19:34]  <IllFlower> The stakes are that they leave with the Conservators.
[06-Sep-2014 20:20:01]  <IllFlower> I like talking, so we'll start at talking.
[06-Sep-2014 20:20:41]  <IllFlower> How's all this sound?
[06-Sep-2014 20:20:49]  <ponicalica> Okay
[06-Sep-2014 20:20:54]  <BGTB2005> sounds good
[06-Sep-2014 20:21:05]  <Alicia> Good.
[06-Sep-2014 20:21:51]  <IllFlower> Rig?
[06-Sep-2014 20:22:02]  <IllFlower> I know Kazuki's not in there, but he could get involved later.
[06-Sep-2014 20:22:05]  <IllFlower> With traps, who knows.
[06-Sep-2014 20:22:06]  <Rig> Sure.
[06-Sep-2014 20:22:26]  <IllFlower> Actually, maybe that'd be more follow-up material.
[06-Sep-2014 20:22:49]  <IllFlower> Anyway, the three players with characters inside the restaurant should roll Ac+Ht.

[06-Sep-2014 20:25:00]  <IllFlower> Actually, these guys are sorcerers now, right? Let's throw in the appropriate relationship dice.
[06-Sep-2014 20:25:21]  <IllFlower> Well, hm, actually, I don't think that relationship is at stake yet. Let's hold off on that.
[06-Sep-2014 20:26:03]  <IllFlower> I can always roll in 4d10 Demonic Influence later anyway.
[06-Sep-2014 20:26:16]  <IllFlower> So, who's going to raise first? Alicia has high dice.
[06-Sep-2014 20:26:25]  <IllFlower> It doesn't seem fitting for me to start.
[06-Sep-2014 20:26:34]  <ponicalica> I'm fine with Alicia starting
[06-Sep-2014 20:26:42]  <BGTB2005> same
[06-Sep-2014 20:26:52]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[06-Sep-2014 20:27:15]  <IllFlower> Okay. I'll go next, then ponicalica and finally BGTB2005.
[06-Sep-2014 20:28:31]  <Alicia> Considering using 51...
[06-Sep-2014 20:28:45]  <ponicalica> you can do that if you want
[06-Sep-2014 20:30:16]  <Alicia> @dice use 5 1
[06-Sep-2014 20:30:16]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Used 1 5 = 6. Bank now has 1 2 2 6 6 = 17.
[06-Sep-2014 20:30:26]  <ponicalica> but you kind of have to raise first
[06-Sep-2014 20:30:44]  <Alicia> Yeah I was gonna type something up now. :v
[06-Sep-2014 20:30:57]  <ponicalica> you're supposed to type first :V
[06-Sep-2014 20:31:09]  <Alicia> Oh, I misremembered IF telling me the reverse. My bad.
[06-Sep-2014 20:33:05]  <Alicia> "Listen. You three may be dissenting, and thinking you can do what you want. But we will be making sure you come back on our terms."
[06-Sep-2014 20:33:17]  <Alicia> (Ack I kinda rushed that because I gotta brb for a bit)
[06-Sep-2014 20:34:14]  <ponicalica> it's fine
[06-Sep-2014 20:34:23]  <ponicalica> besides, a raise of 6 isn't supposed to be that strong anyways
[06-Sep-2014 20:35:20]  <IllFlower> "And what makes you think that?" Ritsuko counters. "You can't even keep one of your own teammates from walking out the door without you."
[06-Sep-2014 20:35:23]  <IllFlower> @dice use 6

[06-Sep-2014 20:36:50]  <IllFlower> "It's embarrassing to even watch you. The Conservators are supposed to be the Order's protectors, not a bunch of squabbling, dishonest children."

[06-Sep-2014 20:37:18]  <IllFlower> Raise 10.
[06-Sep-2014 20:37:24]  <ponicalica> Does this make the Conservators be at stake?
[06-Sep-2014 20:37:47]  <IllFlower> I wouldn't say so.
[06-Sep-2014 20:37:59]  <ponicalica> okay
[06-Sep-2014 20:38:22]  <IllFlower> The group has no authority with the Conservators, so what they have to say about it matters not.
[06-Sep-2014 20:38:44]  * Alicia shakes her fist at the bad dice rolls.
[06-Sep-2014 20:38:52]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.13.215.248> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[06-Sep-2014 20:39:05]  <ponicalica> Alicia: they only attacked with words, so it's only d4 fallout anyways
[06-Sep-2014 20:39:39]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Yes, but I want big rolls so Hikari can properly go off on someone. :p
[06-Sep-2014 20:42:34]  <BGTB2005> feel free to bring in traits
[06-Sep-2014 20:42:57]  <ponicalica> Ayako takes a step back, as she's already been having trouble with dealing with Rin and Kazuki, but can't show this to these sorcerors, who she knows are in the wrong.  "W-we may disagree, but the elders put their trust in us...all of us...to deal with you."
[06-Sep-2014 20:43:00]  <Alicia> True.

[06-Sep-2014 20:46:23]  <IllFlower> Still need sees from Alicia and BGTB2005.
[06-Sep-2014 20:47:12]  <Rig> Kazuki sees… what’s going down.
[06-Sep-2014 20:47:28]  <IllFlower> "Stop, children. What's that sound?"
[06-Sep-2014 20:47:43]  <Rig> I’m so glad we understand each other.

[06-Sep-2014 20:52:47]  <Alicia> "You three are simple, Faithless initiates, not even Conservators gone rogue. We are the Order's protectors, and part of that is making sure people like you stop with these foolhardy ideas."

[06-Sep-2014 20:55:36]  <BGTB2005> Is staying silent and glaring at the three an option?
[06-Sep-2014 20:55:36]  <ponicalica> you could throw a punch
[06-Sep-2014 20:55:54]  <IllFlower> That seems a little out of joint.
[06-Sep-2014 20:55:56]  <ponicalica> ("Uh...what they said.")
[06-Sep-2014 20:56:22]  <IllFlower> Last time we did this we said that only one person had to actually talk, right?
[06-Sep-2014 20:56:27]  <IllFlower> So why don't we do that for now.
[06-Sep-2014 20:56:44]  <Alicia> Sure.
[06-Sep-2014 20:57:12]  <BGTB2005> yes please
[06-Sep-2014 20:58:20]  <IllFlower> Just put forward some dice.

[06-Sep-2014 21:04:02]  <IllFlower> Might I remind you that giving and waiting for them to leave before starting a follow-up conflict is also an option.

[06-Sep-2014 21:10:00]  <IllFlower> Alicia: I'm taking away your 6.
[06-Sep-2014 21:10:47]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: what're you thinking

[06-Sep-2014 21:20:36]  <IllFlower> I guess I have the high dice, so I'll start this round. Then Alicia, ponicalica, and BGTB2005.
[06-Sep-2014 21:22:47]  <IllFlower> "Isn't that extraordinarily convenient for all of you? Look at how well it's worked out. You can do whatever you want in the name of preserving the hierarchy, while the rest of us can't even light candles without permission. Isn't that nice?"

[06-Sep-2014 21:25:15]  <ponicalica> nobody has 9
[06-Sep-2014 21:25:40]  <Alicia> I would need to bring in something like a 2d6 or 1d6.
[06-Sep-2014 21:26:31]  <IllFlower> Hikari's the law.
[06-Sep-2014 21:26:59]  <Alicia> Yeah, I want to bring that in. It's, like, who do they think they are? Hikari Hiiragi?
[06-Sep-2014 21:27:08]  <Alicia> @dice add 1d6

[06-Sep-2014 21:27:27]  <IllFlower> Who's talking this time?
[06-Sep-2014 21:27:33]  <Alicia> Hmm...
[06-Sep-2014 21:27:33]  <ponicalica> Hikari, probably.
[06-Sep-2014 21:27:52]  <ponicalica> I'm considering transforming as a "this is the symbol of my authority" thing though
[06-Sep-2014 21:28:55]  <ponicalica> Maybe Rin and Ayako should just walk out while Hikari talks though, since even that's a bit of a stretch
[06-Sep-2014 21:28:56]  <IllFlower> Insert South Park joke here.
[06-Sep-2014 21:29:23]  <Alicia> I'm trying to think of what to say, but my thoughts are so disorderly. Since the Law is being brought in, something on my mind was all "you talking about the hierarchy??"
[06-Sep-2014 21:29:35]  <Alicia> disorderly I'm having trouble*
[06-Sep-2014 21:30:09]  <IllFlower> It's more she doesn't care if it's unfair. She's the law.
[06-Sep-2014 21:30:14]  <IllFlower> The law is always right.
[06-Sep-2014 21:30:43]  <Alicia> And of course, the Order appointed - er, she is a part of the Order, after all.
[06-Sep-2014 21:32:32]  <Rig> Of course, they seem to care a lot about the law.
[06-Sep-2014 21:33:46]  <Alicia> "'Niceness' has nothing to do with it. You become an initiate, and you work with the Order. You follow the Order, not go off on some harebrained scheme! A few random initiates like you couldn't understand the way of the Order!"
[06-Sep-2014 21:33:49]  <IllFlower> Well, Hikari doesn't care that they don't care.
[06-Sep-2014 21:33:55]  <Alicia> @dice use 5 6

[06-Sep-2014 21:33:59]  <IllFlower> It's recursive not-caring.
[06-Sep-2014 21:34:13]  <IllFlower> So what are Ayako and Rin going to do?
[06-Sep-2014 21:34:24]  <BGTB2005> @dice
[06-Sep-2014 21:34:24]  <Omnipresence> 14BGTB2005: Bank has 3 = 3.
[06-Sep-2014 21:34:37]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Not caring is best for them anyway; after all, they were wrong the second they crossed Hikari. :p
[06-Sep-2014 21:35:35]  <ponicalica> I think Ayako may walk out and hope whatever Kazuki planned works; the whole "last meal" etc., unless Rin wants to escalate
[06-Sep-2014 21:36:36]  <Rig> I have to do some chores at 6PM, by the way. 
[06-Sep-2014 21:37:25]  <IllFlower> ACCELERATE
[06-Sep-2014 21:37:39]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: what do you think
[06-Sep-2014 21:38:24]  <BGTB2005> at the moment, Rin still doesn't want to hurt them
[06-Sep-2014 21:38:51]  <Alicia> What does she want? For them to come in nicely?
[06-Sep-2014 21:39:08]  <ponicalica> Ayako kinda does but I'm not sure how to escalate in this situation anyways
[06-Sep-2014 21:39:39]  <ponicalica> @dice show

[06-Sep-2014 21:40:28]  <ponicalica> I guess I could throw a 1d4 in for "Pyunpyun's rebellious initiates", since Ayako definitely feels strongly about them
[06-Sep-2014 21:41:00]  <BGTB2005> brb
[06-Sep-2014 21:41:29]  <Rig> You could escalate by simply grabbing them and trying to pull them outside or something.
[06-Sep-2014 21:41:31]  <IllFlower> Well, it's not like Ayako hasn't already punched them.
[06-Sep-2014 21:42:01]  <ponicalica> Rig: Does that work as a see?
[06-Sep-2014 21:42:28]  <IllFlower> I don't see why not.
[06-Sep-2014 21:42:45]  <IllFlower> Collar 'em, then do the dragging as a raise later.
[06-Sep-2014 21:43:30]  <Alicia> Hm, yes. Sounds good.
[06-Sep-2014 21:43:33]  <ponicalica> Ayako's finally sick of dealing with these three.  She's done talking; she grabs one by the sleeve.
[06-Sep-2014 21:43:42]  <BGTB2005> of course Hikari would like that
[06-Sep-2014 21:43:51]  <ponicalica> Would this be physical, not-yet-fighting or would it be fighting?
[06-Sep-2014 21:43:54]  <IllFlower> What's Rin's response? Still need one.
[06-Sep-2014 21:44:00]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: That's basically hand-to-hand at that point.
[06-Sep-2014 21:44:18]  <IllFlower> So roll Bd+Wl.
[06-Sep-2014 21:44:32]  <ponicalica> @dice add 4d6 5d6
[06-Sep-2014 21:44:32]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Rolled 2 2 3 3 5 5 6 6 6 = 38. Bank now has 1 2 2 2 3 3 5 5 5 6 6 6 = 46.
[06-Sep-2014 21:45:08]  <IllFlower> And I think you can roll your demonic relationship at this point.
[06-Sep-2014 21:45:13]  <Rig> I don’t know if we’ve ever managed to get a non-fighting physical thing.
[06-Sep-2014 21:45:20]  <ponicalica> the original chase
[06-Sep-2014 21:45:20]  <Rig> Hug it out!
[06-Sep-2014 21:45:22]  <ponicalica> in the first ep
[06-Sep-2014 21:45:31]  <ponicalica> and I think maybe Ayako chasing after Minami?
[06-Sep-2014 21:45:38]  <IllFlower> You should have to start with, actually, since they're technically sorcerers.
[06-Sep-2014 21:45:50]  <IllFlower> So throw in those 2d4.
[06-Sep-2014 21:45:51]  <ponicalica> @dice add 2d4 >! this one ,right?
[06-Sep-2014 21:45:51]  <Omnipresence> 14: Rolled 3 3 = 6. Bank now has 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 6 6 6 = 52.
[06-Sep-2014 21:46:02]  <ponicalica> And I have to see 9, right?
[06-Sep-2014 21:46:05]  <IllFlower> Yes.
[06-Sep-2014 21:46:36]  <ponicalica> @dice use 3 6

[06-Sep-2014 21:46:38]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: I assume you're going to cede this one instead of escalating?
[06-Sep-2014 21:46:59]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[06-Sep-2014 21:47:12]  <IllFlower> All right. So it's just Ayako and Hikari now.
[06-Sep-2014 21:47:16]  <Alicia> Rig: I wanted a non-physical conflict, but these dinglehorns have made it hard.
[06-Sep-2014 21:47:30]  <IllFlower> ponicalica, you go next, now that you have a bunch of dice.
[06-Sep-2014 21:47:31]  <Alicia> non-fighting physical*
[06-Sep-2014 21:47:35]  <IllFlower> Alicia afterward.

[06-Sep-2014 21:48:15]  <Alicia> So I roll Bd+Wl too?
[06-Sep-2014 21:48:21]  <ponicalica> Unless you're folding, yes.
[06-Sep-2014 21:48:27]  <IllFlower> You don't have to quite yet.
[06-Sep-2014 21:48:32]  <Alicia> Okay.
[06-Sep-2014 21:48:50]  <IllFlower> Not until you run out of dice.
[06-Sep-2014 21:49:05]  <IllFlower> Or can't realistically respond to a raise.
[06-Sep-2014 21:49:30]  <Alicia> Right, makes sense.
[06-Sep-2014 21:49:51]  <Alicia> Also, lol, just imagining the bystanders right now.
[06-Sep-2014 21:50:23]  <ponicalica> Ayako then grabs the rebellious initiate, and starts to pull them towards the door, where Kazuki is presumably waiting.
[06-Sep-2014 21:50:43]  <IllFlower> You should probably name one.
[06-Sep-2014 21:50:51]  <ponicalica> er, probably.  whoops
[06-Sep-2014 21:51:03]  <Alicia> Youichi.
[06-Sep-2014 21:51:08]  <Alicia> He's rude to Hikari.
[06-Sep-2014 21:51:09]  <ponicalica> Let's say Ritsuko.  She slapped Ayako, after all
[06-Sep-2014 21:51:25]  <IllFlower> Fair enough.
[06-Sep-2014 21:51:55]  <IllFlower> Hit me with some dice.

[06-Sep-2014 21:53:31]  <IllFlower> And I guess now that the witches are my opponent as well I can roll the relationship dice for those.
[06-Sep-2014 21:53:39]  <IllFlower> Funny how they play both sides of the conflict.
[06-Sep-2014 21:53:40]  <ponicalica> welp

[06-Sep-2014 21:54:39]  <IllFlower> Youichi seizes Ayako's arm, keeping her from taking Ritsuko much of anywhere.

[06-Sep-2014 21:54:54]  <IllFlower> Alicia?
[06-Sep-2014 21:55:33]  <Alicia> Are we truly past the point of talking now?
[06-Sep-2014 21:55:43]  <IllFlower> That's up to you.
[06-Sep-2014 21:55:55]  <Alicia> "Hey stop that!!" Ayako and co. continue the physicalizing
[06-Sep-2014 21:55:56]  <IllFlower> Unless you roll an additional die, though, you can't raise.
[06-Sep-2014 21:56:02]  <ponicalica> You can try talking, but if you talk, it has to be something that they will at least listen to while restraining Ayako
[06-Sep-2014 21:56:38]  <Alicia> Translation: Hikari has to play into their game.
[06-Sep-2014 21:56:41]  <IllFlower> That's the gist of it.
[06-Sep-2014 21:57:53]  <Alicia> I think I'll roll Bd+Wl, then.
[06-Sep-2014 21:58:07]  <IllFlower> You're not gonna try hurting their feelings?
[06-Sep-2014 21:58:17]  <IllFlower> I mean, you've got 2d6 on the table.
[06-Sep-2014 21:58:28]  <Alicia> ... hm.
[06-Sep-2014 21:58:45]  <Alicia> Let's see how that goes, because they're really acting like prats.
[06-Sep-2014 21:58:48]  <Alicia> @dice add 2d6

[06-Sep-2014 22:00:13]  <IllFlower> It went. Though technically you're supposed to try first and roll afterward.
[06-Sep-2014 22:00:25]  <Alicia> Er.
[06-Sep-2014 22:00:32]  <ponicalica> how long does Rig have?
[06-Sep-2014 22:00:44]  <Rig> No time.
[06-Sep-2014 22:00:44]  <IllFlower> Negative one minute, I think.
[06-Sep-2014 22:01:06]  <IllFlower> I think we should at least run this through, though.
[06-Sep-2014 22:01:13]  <IllFlower> Rig: Will you be back later?
[06-Sep-2014 22:02:05]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Anyway, need some sticks and stones in the opponent's general direction.
[06-Sep-2014 22:02:10]  <Rig> IllFlower: Probably around 8.
[06-Sep-2014 22:02:22]  <Rig> I might have time between like noon and 3 tomorrow.

[06-Sep-2014 22:14:40]  <ponicalica> Ayako feels the magic running into her skin, and pulls herself together trying not to panic.

A series of purple and green ones aim at the rebellious initiates, while a blue one narrowly misses Rin, who has walked to the corner of the restaurant and is probably setting fires in her hands or something.

[06-Sep-2014 22:31:27]  <Alicia> I was thinking Bd+Wl to restrain them so that they won't fight back.

[06-Sep-2014 22:39:22]  <IllFlower> "Miu!" Ritsuko calls out, but her cry is muffled by the sounds of Hikari and Youichi's struggle.
[06-Sep-2014 22:40:16]  <IllFlower> Youichi rolls out of Hikari's path. She ends up landing on the booth's seat cushions.
[06-Sep-2014 22:40:36]  <IllFlower> @dice use 2 8
[06-Sep-2014 22:40:36]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 2 8 = 10. Bank now has 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 6 = 29.
[06-Sep-2014 22:41:11]  <IllFlower> It's my raise now, so...
[06-Sep-2014 22:42:52]  <IllFlower> Ritsuko wrenches herself free from Ayako's grasp and clambers through the window after Miu's crumpled form. There's a commotion outside - the police are almost certainly on their way.
[06-Sep-2014 22:42:57]  <IllFlower> I give, keeping 6.
[06-Sep-2014 22:43:09]  <IllFlower> Time to roll fallout.
[06-Sep-2014 22:43:16]  <ponicalica> I had, uh, 4d4, right?
[06-Sep-2014 22:43:20]  <IllFlower> 3d4 for BGTB2005 and Alicia, 4d4 for ponicalica.
[06-Sep-2014 22:43:28]  <IllFlower> And as for me...
[06-Sep-2014 22:43:30]  <ponicalica> @dice roll 4d4
[06-Sep-2014 22:43:30]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Rolled 1 3 3 4 = 11.
[06-Sep-2014 22:43:31]  <IllFlower> @dice roll 4d10
[06-Sep-2014 22:43:31]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 4 5 7 8 = 24.

[06-Sep-2014 22:44:06]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 1 1 4 5 = 11.
[06-Sep-2014 22:44:08]  <Alicia> I also rolled a 1.
[06-Sep-2014 22:44:16]  <IllFlower> 10. Miu needs medical attention.
[06-Sep-2014 22:44:16]  <ponicalica> ouch
[06-Sep-2014 22:44:31]  <Alicia> Maybe Hikari could give it?
[06-Sep-2014 22:44:43]  <Alicia> But Hikari's not like Ayako...
[06-Sep-2014 22:45:03]  <ponicalica> Highest Ac other than Ayako is Rin, maybe she should do it
[06-Sep-2014 22:45:05]  <IllFlower> Rin could.
[06-Sep-2014 22:45:24]  <ponicalica> healing fire
[06-Sep-2014 22:45:27]  <BGTB2005> @dice roll 3d4
[06-Sep-2014 22:45:27]  <Omnipresence> 14BGTB2005: Rolled 1 4 4 = 9.
[06-Sep-2014 22:45:37]  <BGTB2005> 8 plus one XP
[06-Sep-2014 22:45:56]  <Alicia> The maximum is + 1 XP right?
[06-Sep-2014 22:46:02]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's work out this fallout first.
[06-Sep-2014 22:46:05]  <ponicalica> yeah, I think so
[06-Sep-2014 22:46:08]  <BGTB2005> I have to go on a grocery run
[06-Sep-2014 22:46:12]  <IllFlower> Yes, you only get one experience item per fallout roll.
[06-Sep-2014 22:46:26]  <ponicalica> so I think I have short-term plus 1 XP.
[06-Sep-2014 22:47:07]  <IllFlower> Gotta love how nearly dying won't give Miu any experience. Poor girl.
[06-Sep-2014 22:47:20]  <Alicia> I have one short-term plus 1 XP.
[06-Sep-2014 22:47:29]  <BGTB2005> but she's an NPC
[06-Sep-2014 22:48:11]  <Alicia> Also I gotta go get food real quick, sorry.
[06-Sep-2014 22:48:16]  <IllFlower> You guys should pick quickly, Miu's gonna die otherwise.
[06-Sep-2014 22:48:30]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005?
[06-Sep-2014 22:48:33]  <BGTB2005> ?
[06-Sep-2014 22:49:01]  <BGTB2005> for Miu's medic? yeah, Rin will try her best
[06-Sep-2014 22:50:26]  <Alicia> Yeah Rin would be best.
[06-Sep-2014 22:50:41]  <Alicia> Given Hikari's Ac, Ayako's going witchy...
[06-Sep-2014 22:50:43]  <IllFlower> I need some fallout items first!
[06-Sep-2014 22:50:48]  <Alicia> Brb
[06-Sep-2014 22:51:23]  <IllFlower> Oh, and I'm sure Kazuki's noticed by this point. But we'll get to him later.
[06-Sep-2014 22:52:12]  <Alicia> At least Kazuki can't chew out Hikari. >:I
[06-Sep-2014 22:52:25]  <Alicia> Well, he can, because he's Kazuki. But you know.
[06-Sep-2014 22:52:47]  <BGTB2005> XP I'd like to save for after attempting to keep Miu alive, if I can
[06-Sep-2014 22:53:04]  <Alicia> Anyway I think fallout could go towards fear of magical attacks?
[06-Sep-2014 22:53:23]  <Alicia> Given what Hikari's just seen the nice ol' Ayako do.
[06-Sep-2014 22:53:25]  <BGTB2005> long term, I think I'll go with a new 1d4 relationship with Kazuki?
[06-Sep-2014 22:54:02]  <Alicia> XP I don't know. Heart? Not afraid of hurting feelings? Will?
[06-Sep-2014 22:54:12]  <ponicalica> For temporary fallout I think maybe some damage to one of my stats(the witch having an effect) but I've no idea about the XP.
[06-Sep-2014 22:54:38]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Okay.
[06-Sep-2014 22:54:41]  <BGTB2005> have to go get groceries, brb
[06-Sep-2014 22:55:45]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Did Hikari learn anything from this experience?
[06-Sep-2014 22:56:05]  <ponicalica> other than "oh fuck Ayako's lost it"
[06-Sep-2014 22:56:14]  <Alicia> Magic can have unintended consequences. No but srsly...
[06-Sep-2014 22:56:15]  <IllFlower> I bumped "fear of magical attacks" for now.
[06-Sep-2014 22:57:03]  <IllFlower> You can subtract a die from the relationship with Ayako. Might not be "good" but it's a possibility.
[06-Sep-2014 22:57:25]  <Alicia> That could also work.
[06-Sep-2014 22:57:26]  <IllFlower> Or perhaps bumping "reckless" down a die.
[06-Sep-2014 22:58:19]  <Alicia> I think 2d4 ~~~> 1d4 makes sense here. She really went hard on the "Listen to ME the Conservator who is ME!"ness and accidentally prompted an attack on Ayako.
[06-Sep-2014 22:58:43]  <Alicia> She's got thoughts on Ayako, but still thinks she can do good, because Ayako is her friend here.
[06-Sep-2014 22:58:46]  <Alicia> Despite, uh.
[06-Sep-2014 23:01:03]  <IllFlower> So less recklessness. Okay, done.
[06-Sep-2014 23:01:12]  <IllFlower> ponicalica?
[06-Sep-2014 23:01:28]  <IllFlower> Could drop Ht for a bit.
[06-Sep-2014 23:01:36]  <ponicalica> Yeah, I was thinking probably that for the short-term.
[06-Sep-2014 23:01:43]  <ponicalica> Still no idea as to what to do with the XP though
[06-Sep-2014 23:01:55]  <Alicia> Is the short-term 2d4 supposed to still be there, or
[06-Sep-2014 23:01:58]  <Alicia> Re fallout
[06-Sep-2014 23:02:10]  <IllFlower> Alicia: I just added that.
[06-Sep-2014 23:02:22]  <Alicia> Ah.
[06-Sep-2014 23:02:30]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: 2d4 -> 2d6 witches ;)
[06-Sep-2014 23:02:48]  <ponicalica> heh, if nobody comes up with something better I think that fits
[06-Sep-2014 23:03:05]  *** monthlysaladstonekun is now known as Saladofstones
[06-Sep-2014 23:03:18]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Is that XP + FA.
[06-Sep-2014 23:03:23]  <IllFlower> Done.
[06-Sep-2014 23:03:34]  <IllFlower> Alicia: What?
[06-Sep-2014 23:03:47]  <Alicia> My current stats.
[06-Sep-2014 23:04:11]  <IllFlower> FA?
[06-Sep-2014 23:04:19]  <ponicalica> fallout?
[06-Sep-2014 23:04:25]  <IllFlower> All your changes are done.
[06-Sep-2014 23:04:40]  <IllFlower> Bumped "reckless" down and "fear of magical attacks" up.
[06-Sep-2014 23:04:47]  <Alicia> Yeah, fallout.
[06-Sep-2014 23:04:50]  <Alicia> Okay.
[06-Sep-2014 23:05:29]  <Alicia> Welp, that was a session.
[06-Sep-2014 23:05:30]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: For what it's worth, if you want to game a bit I suggest using that XP to increase Rin's Ac. ;)
[06-Sep-2014 23:05:56]  <ponicalica> ("she's smart because she bailed before the other two chucklefucks fucked things up")
[06-Sep-2014 23:06:04]  <Alicia> Hey!
[06-Sep-2014 23:07:00]  <IllFlower> Hikari was only an accomplice in fucking things up!
[06-Sep-2014 23:07:12]  <ponicalica> true
[06-Sep-2014 23:07:25]  <Alicia> Hey! An unintentional accomplice!
[06-Sep-2014 23:08:15]  <IllFlower> Anyway, if BGTB2005 makes it back before half past we'll try to save Miu's life.
[06-Sep-2014 23:08:21]  <IllFlower> If not, we'll just push that off until next time.
[06-Sep-2014 23:09:29]  <IllFlower> "You're all either murderers or liars! I'm going to burn your treasured Order to the ground!"
[06-Sep-2014 23:10:02]  <Alicia> Who's that, Youichi
[06-Sep-2014 23:12:37]  *** WildSeraph <~Spheraph@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has joined #madokamadness
[06-Sep-2014 23:13:04]  <IllFlower> Approximately his sentiment, I suppose.
[06-Sep-2014 23:13:31]  <Alicia> Man, Hikari was trying to bring him in nicely too.
[06-Sep-2014 23:13:33]  <BGTB2005> back
[06-Sep-2014 23:13:41]  <IllFlower> Oh, hello again.
[06-Sep-2014 23:13:56]  <ponicalica> Ayako collapses to the ground as the dark cloud dissipates.  She really isn't getting it nicely from the end of these conflicts.
[06-Sep-2014 23:15:11]  <IllFlower> Shall we go into trying to save lives?
[06-Sep-2014 23:15:36]  <ponicalica> I think so.  BGTB2005?
[06-Sep-2014 23:15:43]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[06-Sep-2014 23:16:10]  <Alicia> Hikari looks out to Miu's weak form outside, only to turn back to Ayako. She sets her upright in booth removed from the scene, face somber.
[06-Sep-2014 23:16:16]  <IllFlower> Ritsuko and Rin make it over to Miu at almost exactly the same time.
[06-Sep-2014 23:16:38]  <IllFlower> Miu is covered in glass cuts, and Rin's almost certain her right arm isn't supposed to bend that way.
[06-Sep-2014 23:17:28]  <IllFlower> "She's still alive," Rin says to Ritsuko. "I'll handle this."
[06-Sep-2014 23:17:59]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: You get 8d6 plus whatever you feel is worth adding.
[06-Sep-2014 23:18:12]  <IllFlower> (Rin's Ac, and the group's Bd.)
[06-Sep-2014 23:18:45]  <IllFlower> I suggest making use of the group's 1d10 relationship with Rin, which just mysteriously appeared.

[06-Sep-2014 23:19:32]  <IllFlower> Oh, and that 6 I still have from earlier.
[06-Sep-2014 23:19:35]  <IllFlower> Add that.
[06-Sep-2014 23:19:43]  <IllFlower> In the meantime, I roll the fallout dice plus the demonic influence.
[06-Sep-2014 23:19:44]  <BGTB2005> @dice add 6
[06-Sep-2014 23:19:44]  <Omnipresence> 14BGTB2005: Rolled 6 = 6. Bank now has 1 2 2 2 3 4 5 6 6 6 = 37.

[06-Sep-2014 23:24:44]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005?
[06-Sep-2014 23:24:50]  <BGTB2005> thinking...
[06-Sep-2014 23:24:58]  <ponicalica> think in public
[06-Sep-2014 23:25:04]  <IllFlower> Just trying to stop the bleeding might be a good start.
[06-Sep-2014 23:25:20]  <IllFlower> Are you supposed to move potentially fractured limbs? I can't remember.
[06-Sep-2014 23:25:38]  <Alicia> Use your fire to unblood her bleedy bits.
[06-Sep-2014 23:25:45]  <Alicia> It won't burn her because magic.
[06-Sep-2014 23:27:07]  <ponicalica> cauterize ALL the things
[06-Sep-2014 23:27:23]  <BGTB2005> She might do that at some point
[06-Sep-2014 23:27:38]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Yes.
[06-Sep-2014 23:28:58]  <IllFlower> Anything will do. Even magically spawned bandages.
[06-Sep-2014 23:30:09]  <BGTB2005> Would it be safe to assume most initiates and Conservators know some basic healing chants?
[06-Sep-2014 23:30:34]  <BGTB2005> Ayako probably knows every single one, but Rin doesn't exactly have that sort of knowledge
[06-Sep-2014 23:30:38]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[06-Sep-2014 23:30:49]  <BGTB2005> or at least to that extent
[06-Sep-2014 23:32:41]  <BGTB2005> Quickly assessing Miu's injuries, Rin recites a basic healing chant to stem some of the bleeding
[06-Sep-2014 23:33:38]  <BGTB2005> @dice use 4 5
[06-Sep-2014 23:33:38]  <Omnipresence> 14BGTB2005: Used 4 5 = 9. Bank now has 1 2 2 2 3 6 6 6 = 28.
[06-Sep-2014 23:34:50]  <IllFlower> You sure you want to raise 9? I have 10 so I can reverse that.
[06-Sep-2014 23:38:30]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005?
[06-Sep-2014 23:38:34]  <BGTB2005> I'm here
[06-Sep-2014 23:40:00]  <BGTB2005> my rationale is that Rin doesn't know all the chants Ayako does, but I'm still not too sure about the dice I used
[06-Sep-2014 23:40:10]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:d8:964b:1a2b:3e42> has joined #madokamadness
[06-Sep-2014 23:40:27]  <ponicalica> well, Ayako's especially strong on that respect, I think
[06-Sep-2014 23:40:39]  <ponicalica> or at least she has a wide knowledge.  You probably know enough to stem the bleeding well, though
[06-Sep-2014 23:40:52]  <Alicia> I just imagine Rin is the type to brute force this by expending a helluvalotta magic.
[06-Sep-2014 23:41:03]  <Alicia> As opposed to Ayako's more careful procedures.
[06-Sep-2014 23:41:05]  <IllFlower> Eh, whatever, I'll roll with it.
[06-Sep-2014 23:41:05]  <ponicalica> That too
[06-Sep-2014 23:41:14]  <Alicia> It fits with how she handles offensive stuff.
[06-Sep-2014 23:41:59]  <BGTB2005> and I think getting into things she can't exactly handle also fits her
[06-Sep-2014 23:42:02]  <IllFlower> The chant stops the worst of the bleeding, but only just. It seems like Miu's still in bad enough shape that she may die just from blood loss.

[06-Sep-2014 23:42:21]  <Alicia> :(
[06-Sep-2014 23:43:15]  <IllFlower> Triggered by the magic, a stray burst of light left over from Ayako's attack suddenly bursts forth from Miu's chest directly at Rin's body.

[06-Sep-2014 23:50:08]  <BGTB2005> Surprised by the remnants of magic, Rin twists out of the path of the burst

[06-Sep-2014 23:51:00]  <IllFlower> All right, hit me with a raise.
[06-Sep-2014 23:51:31]  <ponicalica> remember you're probably not going to win this conflict unless you pull in more dice :p
[06-Sep-2014 23:51:46]  <IllFlower> Eh, his chances aren't too bad even now.
[06-Sep-2014 23:52:23]  <IllFlower> I suppose he could have Rin ask Hikari for help or something.
[06-Sep-2014 23:53:45]  <Alicia> "Seriously Hikari I want to help this girl live. Seriously."
[06-Sep-2014 23:55:08]  <Alicia> But yeah, she could.
[06-Sep-2014 23:55:13]  <BGTB2005> yeah, I think Rin will try and call for help from Ayako and Hikari
[06-Sep-2014 23:55:29]  <BGTB2005> though Ayako's probably not in any condition to assist
[06-Sep-2014 23:55:30]  <Alicia> Isn't Ayako passed out.
[06-Sep-2014 23:55:42]  <IllFlower> Well, Ayako would only be able to contribute 1d4 anyway.
[06-Sep-2014 23:55:51]  <IllFlower> Hikari, now there's 2d6 in her!
[06-Sep-2014 23:56:01]  <Alicia> :3
[06-Sep-2014 23:57:21]  <BGTB2005> maybe she could try more healing chants? :V
[06-Sep-2014 23:57:38]  <BGTB2005> though that's probably not going to fly
[06-Sep-2014 23:57:50]  <ponicalica> you could cauterize wounds, let's ignore that fires would probably just hurt them more :p
[06-Sep-2014 23:57:57]  <IllFlower> Ask Hikari to grab the first aid kit from the restaurant!
[06-Sep-2014 23:58:02]  <ponicalica> or, you know, call in Hikari
[06-Sep-2014 23:58:04]  <Alicia> She's probably got some medical supplies in her bag, let's be real here.
[06-Sep-2014 23:58:10]  <ponicalica> heh, yeah
[06-Sep-2014 23:58:19]  <IllFlower> Bad news, Alicia. Those supplies aren't medical.
[06-Sep-2014 23:58:30]  <Alicia> Not those!
[06-Sep-2014 23:58:34]  <BGTB2005> they probably are, just not sterile
[06-Sep-2014 23:58:45]  <Alicia> How dare you, Hikari's not an idiot!
[06-Sep-2014 23:58:54]  <BGTB2005> or, medical in their intended use
[06-Sep-2014 23:58:56]  <IllFlower> JUST GRAB THE GODDAMN FIRST AID KIT
[06-Sep-2014 23:59:11]  <Alicia> Yeah do the dicey rolly thingie.
[07-Sep-2014 00:00:43]  <BGTB2005> briefly looking away from Miu to the restaurant, Rin calls out for assistance from Hikari
[07-Sep-2014 00:01:31]  <Alicia> Hikari rests Ayako's head down on a pillow, and follows out to see Miu's situation.
[07-Sep-2014 00:01:52]  <IllFlower> WHERE THE HELL DID THE PILLOW COME FROM
[07-Sep-2014 00:02:09]  <IllFlower> FUCK IT LET'S DO IT LIVE
[07-Sep-2014 00:02:10]  <BGTB2005> Hikari's Great Big Bag of Everything
[07-Sep-2014 00:02:22]  <Alicia> I imagined it was one of those pseudo-cushiony things you can see in cafes? :v
[07-Sep-2014 00:02:26]  <Alicia> Or whatevs.
[07-Sep-2014 00:02:42]  <Alicia> At least I've seen them a lot in casual and annoyingly upscaley places.
[07-Sep-2014 00:02:44]  <IllFlower> Anyway, let's roll some dice and hope Miu doesn't die.
[07-Sep-2014 00:02:48]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[07-Sep-2014 00:03:12]  <BGTB2005> @dice add 2d6
[07-Sep-2014 00:03:12]  <Omnipresence> 14BGTB2005: Rolled 1 4 = 5. Bank now has 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 6 = 21.
[07-Sep-2014 00:03:20]  <IllFlower> Good enough.
[07-Sep-2014 00:04:01]  <IllFlower> Raise, like, 7, 8, or 9...
[07-Sep-2014 00:05:10]  <BGTB2005> @dice use 3 6
[07-Sep-2014 00:05:10]  <Omnipresence> 14BGTB2005: Used 3 6 = 9. Bank now has 1 1 2 2 2 4 = 12.
[07-Sep-2014 00:06:43]  <IllFlower> The first-aid kit, thankfully, has lots of bandages. Miu's arm is still messed up, though. Well, one step at a time.
[07-Sep-2014 00:06:47]  <IllFlower> @dice
[07-Sep-2014 00:06:47]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Bank has 2 3 6 7 = 18.
[07-Sep-2014 00:06:53]  <IllFlower> @dice use 2 7
[07-Sep-2014 00:06:53]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 2 7 = 9. Bank now has 3 6 = 9.
[07-Sep-2014 00:08:11]  <IllFlower> Suddenly, Miu's body jerks to life. It seems like she's unconsciously reacting to the pain, but it makes trying to treat it that much harder.
[07-Sep-2014 00:08:14]  <IllFlower> @dice use 3 6
[07-Sep-2014 00:08:14]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 3 6 = 9. Bank now has no rolls.
[07-Sep-2014 00:08:22]  <IllFlower> Fallout is d6.
[07-Sep-2014 00:12:46]  <Alicia> Well, at least she don't die from blood loss.
[07-Sep-2014 00:12:56]  <IllFlower> May as well take 4221 and call it a day.

[07-Sep-2014 00:14:12]  <BGTB2005> yeah, trying to think of a plan of action
[07-Sep-2014 00:14:34]  <Alicia> Send her your magic. All o' it.
[07-Sep-2014 00:14:45]  <ponicalica> hold her down or something
[07-Sep-2014 00:14:50]  <ponicalica> I'm sure Hikari has tools for that, for sure ;)
[07-Sep-2014 00:15:05]  <BGTB2005> what doesn't her bag have?
[07-Sep-2014 00:15:10]  <Alicia> Hah. Wellll.
[07-Sep-2014 00:15:41]  <IllFlower> It's just a see. Rin takes a few scratches or something, y'know.
[07-Sep-2014 00:16:01]  <BGTB2005> (I think the answer is a 'How to Not Kill People Guidebook for Conservators')
[07-Sep-2014 00:16:52]  <Alicia> That was an accident!
[07-Sep-2014 00:17:30]  <IllFlower> ANYWAY LET'S NOT THINK TOO HARD OKAY
[07-Sep-2014 00:18:31]  <Rig> Just picturing Kazuki standing outside smoking quietly while this goes down.
[07-Sep-2014 00:18:32]  <BGTB2005> Scratches from Miu's flailing and possibly some shards of glass?
[07-Sep-2014 00:18:53]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that works.
[07-Sep-2014 00:18:54]  <Rig> In his report he says “I told them they could finish their meal, but the other Conservators were not so polite."
[07-Sep-2014 00:19:04]  <BGTB2005> @dice use 4 2 2 1
[07-Sep-2014 00:19:04]  <Omnipresence> 14BGTB2005: Used 1 2 2 4 = 9. Bank now has 1 2 = 3.
[07-Sep-2014 00:19:55]  <Alicia> Kazuki is no one to talk about politeness, though.
[07-Sep-2014 00:20:08]  <IllFlower> Rig: "August 6. Dear Diary, Whatever happened to table manners? I thought it was basic etiquette not to kill people until after they finished eating. Seriously, some people are so gauche."

[07-Sep-2014 00:20:29]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Okay, I can't win, so I'll just give now. Roll your fallout.
[07-Sep-2014 00:20:37]  <BGTB2005> 4d6, right?
[07-Sep-2014 00:20:39]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[07-Sep-2014 00:20:45]  <BGTB2005> @dice roll 4d6
[07-Sep-2014 00:20:45]  <Omnipresence> 14BGTB2005: Rolled 1 1 3 6 = 11.
[07-Sep-2014 00:20:50]  <IllFlower> 9, plus more experience.
[07-Sep-2014 00:20:52]  <BGTB2005> woohoo
[07-Sep-2014 00:21:00]  <Alicia> Dang.
[07-Sep-2014 00:21:30]  <IllFlower> All right, I think we can wrap up here for now and continue next time.
[07-Sep-2014 00:22:13]  <IllFlower> Thanks for sticking it out through this long session. We'll pick up again in a week.
