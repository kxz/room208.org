@time=2013-08-09T22:51:38.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14also: there's something weirdly unsatisfying in being curbstomped towards personal growth
@time=2013-08-09T22:53:16.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako: The same as in they're just different magnitudes. Parrying would be your pressure to change being pairtcularly weak for a moment; Taking the Blow is you doing something ever so slightly dangerous to avoid yielding to the pressure to change; Blocking is somewhere in between.

@time=2013-08-09T22:54:31.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14eh, what I'm saying is just that the "something ever so slightly dangerous" to me feels like a change in type, not just magnitude
@time=2013-08-09T22:55:07.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14but with me playing as my insecurities, should it be more hopeful or less hopeful
@time=2013-08-09T22:55:58.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, Rig's blowtake was "sometimes violence /is/ the answer", temporary. This was because he Took the Blow when in RP he was forced into that judo throw in order to stop the girl from stabbing herself.
@time=2013-08-09T22:56:30.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In order to not yield she pushed herself into a slightly different mindset, is how it was played out; but in the end it was still him not having enough dice to continue on normally, kinda thing.

@time=2013-08-09T22:59:04.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also it's not necessarily a foregone conclusion; part of the RP aspect of the game is that what happens in text can change what's justifiable as going on/not Giving.

@time=2013-08-09T23:00:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In terms of magnitude, a block/dodge would be something like brushing off the additional pressure, considering it something ignorable, distancing herself from the situation.

@time=2013-08-09T23:10:21.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Her sharp mind, normally taken to the minutiae and principles of the magical world, turns instead on her own psyche.  "This is a magical problem...but not one your, frankly, sheltered self is actually equipped to fix, is it?  You wouldn't be able to intervene in something this nasty."  Raise 33, leave 11116.
@time=2013-08-09T23:11:01.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14why did I spend so much time thinking up dice scenarios anyways o_O
@time=2013-08-09T23:11:11.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14this is just ponicalica, the player, overthinking everything >_<
@time=2013-08-09T23:12:56.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Haha, yeah, don't worry about specific dice or anything like that. The manual even has numerous instances where it's like "okay this thing didn't happen, instead /this/ happened and then I did this" between a raise and a see
@time=2013-08-09T23:13:18.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :also, brb, dinner.
@time=2013-08-09T23:13:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako's mind turns. "But isn't that my job? If I can't get involved in magical situations, what in the world *can* I do?" See 24, leave 1355.
@time=2013-08-09T23:15:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She notices that the fight seems to be spilling in her direction, as people begin to get drawn in. "And if I don't do something, I might get hurt too!" Raise 15, leave 35. **
@time=2013-08-09T23:18:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(If you want to escalate this to a physical conflict, one obvious option is to make Ayako lift her legs and run. Just a thought.)
@time=2013-08-09T23:20:36.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14hmm, if I have the mechanics for reversing the blow right, I suppose I could do that and win the conflict, or artificially have a one and then Give, if I wanted, or artificially escalate and run away...  (sorry for overthinking this)
@time=2013-08-09T23:21:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You can reverse the blow with a 6 and then raise 1(6), yes.
@time=2013-08-09T23:25:34.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14so the second situation would be the one in which she remembers the relevant rune in the nick of time, correct?  Deliberating on which situation I want to have my character undergo...I'd say this probably shouldn't be this hard, but I think this actually is supposed to be this hard
@time=2013-08-09T23:27:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You can give in conflicts at any point, you don't need to artificially induce anything.
@time=2013-08-09T23:27:46.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14oh right. >_<
@time=2013-08-09T23:28:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The second situation would be one where the urgency of the situation overrides her anxieties and she manages to steel herself.
@time=2013-08-09T23:28:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Stop thinking and just *do* it already!" in essence.
@time=2013-08-09T23:30:07.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness : Sorry, i can't help but talk about things that bug me with my parents which inevitably results in me walking around discussing "whether or not I /really/ have chronic anxiety".
@time=2013-08-09T23:30:14.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so. later to come back than i woulda been.
@time=2013-08-09T23:31:51.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"This is a magical problem...it should have a magical solution...I just have to find it!"  Ayako takes a few steps back to avoid getting directly pulled in, and starts flipping through her notebook for something relevant to "quell magically induced violence", which has to be one of the more common runes.  Give.
@time=2013-08-09T23:33:02.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14and now I suppose all that's left is the 1d6 and the fallout?
@time=2013-08-09T23:33:04.000Z :Ayako PRIVMSG #madokamadness :+roll 3d4
@time=2013-08-09T23:33:04.000Z :rollermine PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako: (4+1+3)=8
@time=2013-08-09T23:33:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, that's a 7. You take one short-term fallout effect, as well as the normal d6 trait for initiation.
@time=2013-08-09T23:34:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Fallout effects are on p. 82.
@time=2013-08-09T23:35:30.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not bad, mister calica. It'll get more natural as we go on.
@time=2013-08-09T23:36:01.000Z :Ayako PART #madokamadness
@time=2013-08-09T23:36:17.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think I just need to not overthink things. :V
@time=2013-08-09T23:36:50.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm learning that enough as we go on. RPing can work well enough on less rigid structures than i convinced myself were necessary.
@time=2013-08-09T23:37:12.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :though i guess for me it's more "i want the whole thing planned out" than anything else :v
@time=2013-08-09T23:37:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It never hurts to talk a resolution out.
@time=2013-08-09T23:37:40.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :oh yeah, and like. i was being so vocal because the whole game's a sorta group effort thing, even if the conflict's only you and the GM.
@time=2013-08-09T23:38:01.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah.  I just wasn't sure about your interpretation of the rules, and lashed out.  sorry4that >_<
@time=2013-08-09T23:38:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :This is part of why I don't do that whole nick-swapping thing these days. It enforces too much of a first-person viewpoint.
@time=2013-08-09T23:38:05.000Z :Hitomi_Yano PRIVMSG #madokamadness :it's fine!
@time=2013-08-09T23:38:12.000Z :Hitomi_Yano NICK Barcode
@time=2013-08-09T23:39:00.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I'll probably just put the name in brackets or something.
@time=2013-08-09T23:39:10.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The way the manual talks about things you don't really need OOC tags.
@time=2013-08-09T23:39:23.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :since you're more narrating what's going on and stuff ,even if it's usualy just narrating your character.
@time=2013-08-09T23:39:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Barcode: You'll notice I was pretty conversational when I was running MB. Such was the influence of Dogs on my GM style.
@time=2013-08-09T23:40:07.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :heh.
@time=2013-08-09T23:40:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I feel like for the d4 a good one might be "Gets nervous around crowds", considering the circumstances of the conflict
@time=2013-08-09T23:40:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sounds good to me.
@time=2013-08-09T23:41:07.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :i think players having more control will also help avoid the whole "can I do this/does my character know about this/should i roll for stuffy nostrils today" thing.
@time=2013-08-09T23:41:09.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(of course I think about that one before I do the d6, which is more important)
@time=2013-08-09T23:41:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Eh, whatever.
@time=2013-08-09T23:41:55.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Take yer time. we're done when you're done anyway.
@time=2013-08-09T23:45:16.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :prone to hesitancy/overthinking?  Don't want to do a slash like that in a Trait (I think; this game is supposed to be permissive of so much that I can never be sure of what's not right) but which one better describes what went down
@time=2013-08-09T23:45:48.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well, you hoped to *checks*
@time=2013-08-09T23:46:30.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I hope Ayako deals with a violent situation without collapsing under pressure" --> You could, if you don't feel like being creative, just be like "I've learned to stay calm in the midst of violence" 1d6
@time=2013-08-09T23:46:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Her hesitancy eventually succumbed to the immediacy of what was going on, though.
@time=2013-08-09T23:46:59.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :or change that description to be more related to immediacy, as IF just described.
@time=2013-08-09T23:47:40.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: true.
@time=2013-08-09T23:47:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, yeah, what Barcode said would be an idea. Or, if you want to modulate it a bit, something like "doesn't run from violence (which isn't to say she likes being around it) d6."
@time=2013-08-09T23:48:29.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :doesn't run from violence (but doesn't seek it out like Hitomi) 1d6
@time=2013-08-09T23:48:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(no, not actually putting that)
@time=2013-08-09T23:48:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :lol
@time=2013-08-09T23:49:13.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :heheh
@time=2013-08-09T23:49:19.000Z :Barcode PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"doesn't run from Hitomi"
@time=2013-08-09T23:49:24.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hehehe
@time=2013-08-09T23:50:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, I think we're done for today. I'll get back to you guys about scheduling an actual first session.
@time=2013-08-09T23:50:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for playing, you guys.
