@time=2014-08-09T20:06:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, so last time we ended with the Conservators barely not killing a guy.
@time=2014-08-09T20:06:42.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sorry, had to go do stuff. Back.
@time=2014-08-09T20:06:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I have new branch stuff, but if you want to take the time first to let the characters play out their reactions, I can do that as well.
@time=2014-08-09T20:07:34.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, let’s do that.
@time=2014-08-09T20:07:37.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, set the scene for it and all that.
@time=2014-08-09T20:07:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let’s be in Shii’s office.
@time=2014-08-09T20:08:00.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I’ve got a scene, if you don’t mind me stepping in IllFlower?
@time=2014-08-09T20:08:13.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I have a reaction to give but I'll let Rig go first
@time=2014-08-09T20:08:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :As usual, Shii's office is mostly composed of a desk with a phone, some papers, and Shii herself on top of it.
@time=2014-08-09T20:08:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: Okay, go ahead.
@time=2014-08-09T20:10:15.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki is leaning against the wall by the door, glaring intently at the back of Rin’s head. At the moment he’s caught between a cold kind of anger and the warm relief that Yuuya was stopped. Still, he can’t help but continue picturing the joyous fury on Rin’s face when she attacked Yuuya in the hospital.
@time=2014-08-09T20:10:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :**
@time=2014-08-09T20:12:57.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm sorry.  I...I let my magic go.  I think I've become more powerful since becoming a Conservator, but I lost my balance.  I shouldn't be attacking so recklessly."
@time=2014-08-09T20:13:41.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako walks up to the table, grabs something from her purse, and then places on the table a rod about a foot long, covered in various magical runes.
@time=2014-08-09T20:13:55.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari looks from Ayako to Rin to Kazuki, staying silent.
@time=2014-08-09T20:14:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii looks up at Ayako with a puzzled expression. "What is this?"
@time=2014-08-09T20:16:14.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The elemental wand.  I let myself go out there, and I could have killed someone.  When I was there I could only think of the magic running through my body, and the deceptions Yuuya tried to run.  I don't want more temptation to kill."
@time=2014-08-09T20:17:05.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The last few nights I've had trouble sleeping.  I saw his bloodied face each time.  If someone else thinks they can handle that wand's power, they can take it, but I can't."
@time=2014-08-09T20:17:17.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I hope that wasn't too much.
@time=2014-08-09T20:17:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii looks uncomfortably towards the back of the room, at Kazuki.
@time=2014-08-09T20:17:45.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(also ignore that she didn't actually use the wand but still)
@time=2014-08-09T20:18:46.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki looks back at Shii. “I can see why I was asked to join this team now,” he says.
@time=2014-08-09T20:19:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii nods, averting her eyes.
@time=2014-08-09T20:20:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Right," Shii says, returning her attention to Ayako. "If that's what it takes. I can't hold on to this, but I'll make sure it's turned over to someone who can."
@time=2014-08-09T20:21:03.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Thank you."
@time=2014-08-09T20:21:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii steps over to the edge of the desk and gently paws the wand into an empty drawer.

@time=2014-08-09T20:24:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well," she says, turning back towards the Conservators, "it looks like you all have a grasp of the situation regarding Kinomoto, so I don't have anything to add. I'll be here in case you wish to confer with me, but otherwise you're all free to go."
@time=2014-08-09T20:24:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Her eyes again dart back towards Kazuki.
@time=2014-08-09T20:25:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It's not just you, Ayako..?" Hikari whispers in her direction, making sure Kazuki's out of earshot.
@time=2014-08-09T20:25:28.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki ignores the familiar and steps out the door, leaving the others behind.
@time=2014-08-09T20:25:28.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hm?"
@time=2014-08-09T20:26:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii turns around as the others leave, going back to doing whatever it is familiars do.
@time=2014-08-09T20:27:11.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think Alicia has one last thing to say
@time=2014-08-09T20:27:15.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It's just, ever since that day at the trainyard, back with-" Hikari stumbles, not sure how to proceed, given recent events.
@time=2014-08-09T20:27:48.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"... you know, never mind it, Ayako. I think we have other issues at hand, anyway."
@time=2014-08-09T20:28:07.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I--Okay.  Yeah."
@time=2014-08-09T20:29:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :As Kazuki makes his way down the hall, some distance ahead of the rest of the group, a girl approaching in the other direction calls to him.
@time=2014-08-09T20:30:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Sakura! Are you free right now?"
@time=2014-08-09T20:30:22.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari eases out, leaving the door open for the rest. Kazuki isn't anywhere to be seen, though she's at a loss for what she would say to him.
@time=2014-08-09T20:30:36.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("I just finished glaring at my insane co-workers!")
@time=2014-08-09T20:32:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: Should Kazuki know this girl?
@time=2014-08-09T20:33:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :No, she's just a random colleague.
@time=2014-08-09T20:34:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“Yes,” Kazuki says, glancing behind him briefly. “I’ve got some time."
@time=2014-08-09T20:35:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"A girl came by wanting to talk to a Conservator," the passer-by says. "I have to leave now, but I told her I'd find someone for her. Could you do that for me? She's waiting in the pews out front."
@time=2014-08-09T20:37:15.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“Yeah, I need something to take my mind of things. I’ll take care of it."
@time=2014-08-09T20:37:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I hope you're not just going to leave the other three out of the loop. :p
@time=2014-08-09T20:37:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Although I can understand if Kazuki would like them to hang back for a bit.
@time=2014-08-09T20:38:29.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Long as he doesn't have to deal with them, surely.
@time=2014-08-09T20:38:34.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Should the others catch up to him?
@time=2014-08-09T20:39:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I assume so. We don't split the group, after all.
@time=2014-08-09T20:39:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.
@time=2014-08-09T20:42:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari manages to find Kazuki, with the others, but decides to wait and stay back, seeing him in conversation with someone else.
@time=2014-08-09T20:42:19.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Probably another assignment..."
@time=2014-08-09T20:42:57.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako stands back behind Hikari, nodding.
@time=2014-08-09T20:44:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just as he was told, there's a girl sitting in the front pew when Kazuki makes his way into the main chamber. Her hair is shoulder-length and a little frilly. She's wearing her usual day clothes; a little unusual on these grounds, where usually initiates are transformed, but not worth much beyond a raised eyebrow.
@time=2014-08-09T20:44:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She seems to be right about Hikari's age.
@time=2014-08-09T20:45:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki greets the girl and introduces himself. He knows the others aren’t far behind him.
@time=2014-08-09T20:46:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The girl introduces herself as Narumi Tsuruoka, with a somewhat awkward bow. The name "Tsuruoka" triggers a twinge of recognition on Kazuki's part. Just a twinge, though.
@time=2014-08-09T20:46:58.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :another prophet, probably
@time=2014-08-09T20:47:05.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well, prophet's kid
@time=2014-08-09T20:47:29.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari eyes the general area that Kazuki went off to, before stopping and facing the others. "I... think we should stick to the sidelines for this one. Ayako, Rin, how do you feel about watching enough to know what's going on, and leaving it to him?"
@time=2014-08-09T20:47:50.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A fair bit more consideration than usual for her, thankfully.
@time=2014-08-09T20:48:05.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"No, I think we should follow.  If they asked for a Conservator, we should probably be able to ask questions as well as Kazuki."
@time=2014-08-09T20:48:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Is Kazuki going to be the only one liaising? A little boring!
@time=2014-08-09T20:48:54.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well I meant like two steps back. Interacting, just letting Kazuki lead instead. Doubting he'd want to see the three girls get up in his grill during this time.
@time=2014-08-09T20:49:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just a second. Something's come up. Be back in under ten.
@time=2014-08-09T20:49:46.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“How can we help you?” Kazuki asks as IllFlower leaves to put out more fires.
@time=2014-08-09T20:50:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Right." Hikari nods. "We should be there to contribute too, yes..."
@time=2014-08-09T20:50:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(The idea def wasn't sitting out entirely.)
@time=2014-08-09T20:52:07.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako walks up to the pews behind Kazuki while the girl ponders her words.
@time=2014-08-09T20:55:50.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :okay i'm hearing a loud high pitched noise.  i don't think it's a fire alarm but if it is I'll try to get on IRC and yell about it
@time=2014-08-09T20:56:14.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :okay, don't hear it anymore
@time=2014-08-09T21:00:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Back. Sorry for the sudden interruption.
@time=2014-08-09T21:02:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"My familiar and I have been having a bit of a disagreement," Narumi begins. "I was hoping you might be able to help me argue my case."

@time=2014-08-09T21:04:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Where do I start...
@time=2014-08-09T21:05:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"My sister Hatsue died almost a year ago. She was an initiate, like me."
@time=2014-08-09T21:05:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Narumi pauses for a bit to gather her thoughts.
@time=2014-08-09T21:07:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"They were going to hold a memorial service for her, just like the ones they hold for every initiate who dies. Nobody could figure out what had happened to her at first, so..."
@time=2014-08-09T21:07:34.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki gives her a sympathetic look. He’s aware that lots of initiates lose their lives.
@time=2014-08-09T21:09:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She trails off, then: "Eventually they found out that my sister was a sorcerer. A witch killed her during a botched possession ritual."
@time=2014-08-09T21:10:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Narumi looks away. Kazuki remembers now where he'd heard her surname before.
@time=2014-08-09T21:10:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The details are a bit fuzzy to him, but he already knows what Narumi says next.
@time=2014-08-09T21:11:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"They canceled the memorial. The Prophets did her last rites in a closed service. I wasn't allowed in. No one was."
@time=2014-08-09T21:12:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Narumi looks away, biting her lip.
@time=2014-08-09T21:12:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“I’m sorry,” Kazuki says. He’s still unsure how they can help this girl.
@time=2014-08-09T21:13:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The first anniversary of her death's coming up next week. I wanted to do at least something small for her. A magical funeral like they do for everyone else.
@time=2014-08-09T21:15:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"My familiar says he won't let me do it, though. He's never even contemplated otherwise."
@time=2014-08-09T21:16:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki nods. The Order's always come down hard on cult leaders, even in death.
@time=2014-08-09T21:17:43.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki knows that the familiar is in the right though. The Order would forbid it. He still felt bad though. This girl just wanted to honor her sister, despite the things she’d done.
@time=2014-08-09T21:17:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"He says it might attract the wrong kind of attention from her old followers."
@time=2014-08-09T21:18:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Narumi shakes her head in frustration, clearly unconvinced that this is a likely outcome.
@time=2014-08-09T21:18:19.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He thought about how he would feel if Yuuya was dead. He’d want a service for him, despite of the things he did.
@time=2014-08-09T21:19:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"So I was hoping you might be able to convince him otherwise. You know, since familiars have to answer to the Conservators.
@time=2014-08-09T21:20:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I just want a chance to finally say good-bye, you know?"
@time=2014-08-09T21:21:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki looks at the girl. She seems like she’s moments away from crying. “I understand,” he says.
@time=2014-08-09T21:21:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He looks over his shoulder at his group before turning back to Narumi. “We’ll do what we can.”
@time=2014-08-09T21:21:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Thank you," Narumi says softly.
@time=2014-08-09T21:24:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She bows again and prepares to leave the old church.
@time=2014-08-09T21:25:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki stands and waits until she’s out the door before heading over to his group. He explains Narumi’s request to them.
@time=2014-08-09T21:25:54.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“The problem is, her familiar is right. There can’t be a service for her sister.”
@time=2014-08-09T21:27:19.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I agree.  If her cultists are still out there, they'll get exactly those wrong messages."

@time=2014-08-09T21:35:55.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, it'd be good to convince them.
@time=2014-08-09T21:37:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shall we, then?
@time=2014-08-09T21:39:04.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes.
@time=2014-08-09T21:40:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Narumi's familiar is based in the hollowed-out concrete core of what used to be an apartment building. The Conservators know familiars have a predilection for places that are, let's say, not quite fresh, but the gray shell is imposing even with that in consideration.
@time=2014-08-09T21:42:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Pyunpyun appears to be entertaining something of a crowd when the Conservators arrive. One of them, a boy about Narumi's age, gives them a knowing nod as they enter the room.
@time=2014-08-09T21:43:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Aside from a television in one corner, and a phone in another, there is precious little here.

@time=2014-08-10T01:07:41.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You too, Alicia
@time=2014-08-10T01:07:47.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Huzzah.
@time=2014-08-10T01:07:49.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :...or you could've rolled another 3d4
@time=2014-08-10T01:08:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: Eh, oh well. More correct this way.
@time=2014-08-10T01:08:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Short-term fallout, so I'm thinking I'm just gonna take the "leaving the scene" option.
@time=2014-08-10T01:08:26.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: I think taking a 1d4 relationship with Youichi would be appropriate here?
@time=2014-08-10T01:09:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that would work.
@time=2014-08-10T01:09:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005, ponicalica: You need to take an item of short-term fallout.
@time=2014-08-10T01:10:05.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.  I'm considering the "leaving the scene" myself, actually, if that doesn't conflict.
@time=2014-08-10T01:10:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And I'm thinking about my long-term.
@time=2014-08-10T01:10:25.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Leaving the scene?
@time=2014-08-10T01:10:45.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako's annoyed at Kazuki's attempt at diplomacy, etc, but knows she's lost.
@time=2014-08-10T01:11:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, nobody's launching a follow-up conflict, so I think that works.
@time=2014-08-10T01:11:06.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ah.
@time=2014-08-10T01:11:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Of course, we'll all have to roleplay our annoyance.
@time=2014-08-10T01:11:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That also means Ayako will be out of the proceedings when we start again, since we're probably going to close on this scene.
@time=2014-08-10T01:12:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that conflict went poorly.
@time=2014-08-10T01:12:17.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm thinking a short term 2d6 -> 2d4 relationship with Hikari?
@time=2014-08-10T01:12:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: Works.
@time=2014-08-10T01:12:46.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm considering taking a new trait about believing she's in the right/knows her position about these things, but that sounds too similar to others...
@time=2014-08-10T01:12:48.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako glares at Kazuki as he begins to negotiate with Pyunpyun's charges.

@time=2014-08-10T01:13:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :With Ayako leaving the scene, I don't think also leaving would be good.
@time=2014-08-10T01:13:11.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or, hm...
@time=2014-08-10T01:13:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm thinking I'll close out Pyunpyun's initiates first before anything else.
@time=2014-08-10T01:13:26.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay.
@time=2014-08-10T01:13:36.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I believe I also have experience
@time=2014-08-10T01:13:42.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She doesn't like seeing what she sees as letting disaster happen, and an image, with some peculiar green and purple highlights, of Jun's dead body "graces" her thoughts.
@time=2014-08-10T01:13:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: You can't take that as long-term fallout anyway.
@time=2014-08-10T01:13:48.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: same, but we can do that later
@time=2014-08-10T01:14:06.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: You're right. I was scrolling through the pages and got mixed up.
@time=2014-08-10T01:14:43.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako almost feels like punching Jun, but knows that if she does, it would just make everything even worse.
@time=2014-08-10T01:15:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Especially because that would involve digging up Jun's grave.
@time=2014-08-10T01:15:06.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :are you sure you meant Jun and not Rin?
@time=2014-08-10T01:15:21.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki is already Kazuki, punching him wouldn't help.
@time=2014-08-10T01:15:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: What're you going to take?
@time=2014-08-10T01:15:50.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: I meant Kazuki.  Definitely not Jun.  Got my names way mixed up.  >_<
@time=2014-08-10T01:16:00.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: Get rid of a belonging, like the knife?
@time=2014-08-10T01:16:11.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also Ayako would never punch Jun-sama :p
@time=2014-08-10T01:16:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: I recommend bumping down "I'm the law" from 2d6 to 1d6. But that's just me.
@time=2014-08-10T01:16:35.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that feels appropriate.
@time=2014-08-10T01:16:46.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Losing a belonging just doesn’t really match what happened.
@time=2014-08-10T01:17:00.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.
@time=2014-08-10T01:17:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'll do that.
@time=2014-08-10T01:17:15.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Should Ayako leave now or should I let IllFlower go first?
@time=2014-08-10T01:17:21.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alas, Hikari, sometimes people simply won't listen to you!
@time=2014-08-10T01:17:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'll go first.
@time=2014-08-10T01:17:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: Press Enter. :p
@time=2014-08-10T01:17:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I thought I did.
@time=2014-08-10T01:18:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well, I'm glad we got that little misunderstanding sorted out," Youichi says in an annoyed voice. "At least something got accomplished.
@time=2014-08-10T01:18:40.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :heh, most of Rin's named relationships are d4s
@time=2014-08-10T01:18:51.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :even though one is short-term
@time=2014-08-10T01:18:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I don't know about you, but I think it's about time we took our leave. Good luck."
@time=2014-08-10T01:19:19.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki resists the urge to sneer at the retreating Youichi.
@time=2014-08-10T01:19:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Youichi's well-wishes don't exactly come out sounding all that supportive.
@time=2014-08-10T01:19:58.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :everyone beating up on Kazuki in their heads
@time=2014-08-10T01:20:14.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well he's Kazuki.
@time=2014-08-10T01:20:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Pyunpyun's initiates head off, leaving the Conservators alone in front of that concrete husk of a building.
@time=2014-08-10T01:20:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hey, we made it through a talky conflict!
@time=2014-08-10T01:20:49.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Without punching!
@time=2014-08-10T01:21:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Solid!
@time=2014-08-10T01:21:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mean, it didn’t work out really well for anyone.
@time=2014-08-10T01:21:13.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There was the one with Yumiko, but I'm not sure if it counts?
@time=2014-08-10T01:21:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Okey-doke, your go.
@time=2014-08-10T01:21:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: "Sticks and stones" etc.
@time=2014-08-10T01:22:47.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You...they...I...I need to be alone.  Good luck."  Ayako's well-wishes sound about as supportive as Youichi's.
@time=2014-08-10T01:23:26.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She then turns around, and walks out of Pyunpyun's home base.
@time=2014-08-10T01:23:29.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki is surprised that Ayako is so unsupportive. It was a conclusion. Not even one they technically needed to hold up.
@time=2014-08-10T01:24:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("Fat lot of good your magical diplomacy did there!")
@time=2014-08-10T01:24:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shall we call this wrapped up?
@time=2014-08-10T01:24:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyone have anything they want to say?
@time=2014-08-10T01:25:04.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think I also have an XP fallout but I don't know what to spend it on.
@time=2014-08-10T01:25:09.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari looks at Ayako sympathetically, before staring back at Kazuki and Rin. Of course it would go like this with him...
@time=2014-08-10T01:25:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I imagine Ayako's leaving in a huff overrode any awkward antagonism between Rin and the others.
@time=2014-08-10T01:25:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Isn't that great?
@time=2014-08-10T01:25:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki looks at his two remaining colleagues.
@time=2014-08-10T01:25:48.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Actually, I want to amend her exit as brushing against Rin as she leaves, if possible.
@time=2014-08-10T01:26:04.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :disdain levels maximum
@time=2014-08-10T01:26:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“That went… let’s just find Narumi and deal with this.”
@time=2014-08-10T01:26:35.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Lead the way, Kazuki."
@time=2014-08-10T01:27:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, I think that's a suitably abrupt close to this session. Let's drop the curtains on this one.
@time=2014-08-10T01:27:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Those of you with experience fallout can work on that now.
@time=2014-08-10T01:27:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Otherwise, thanks for playing, everyone. See you next week.
