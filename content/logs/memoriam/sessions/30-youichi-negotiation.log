[09-Aug-2014 20:05:51]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: The Magic School Bus
[09-Aug-2014 20:05:55]  <Rig> I can only hope.
[09-Aug-2014 20:06:16]  <IllFlower> Okay, so last time we ended with the Conservators barely not killing a guy.
[09-Aug-2014 20:06:42]  <Alicia> Sorry, had to go do stuff. Back.
[09-Aug-2014 20:06:58]  <IllFlower> I have new branch stuff, but if you want to take the time first to let the characters play out their reactions, I can do that as well.
[09-Aug-2014 20:07:34]  <Rig> Yeah, let’s do that.
[09-Aug-2014 20:07:37]  <Alicia> Yeah, set the scene for it and all that.
[09-Aug-2014 20:07:44]  <Rig> Let’s be in Shii’s office.
[09-Aug-2014 20:08:00]  <Rig> I’ve got a scene, if you don’t mind me stepping in IllFlower?
[09-Aug-2014 20:08:13]  <ponicalica> I have a reaction to give but I'll let Rig go first
[09-Aug-2014 20:08:28]  <IllFlower> As usual, Shii's office is mostly composed of a desk with a phone, some papers, and Shii herself on top of it.
[09-Aug-2014 20:08:33]  <IllFlower> Rig: Okay, go ahead.
[09-Aug-2014 20:10:15]  <Rig> Kazuki is leaning against the wall by the door, glaring intently at the back of Rin’s head. At the moment he’s caught between a cold kind of anger and the warm relief that Yuuya was stopped. Still, he can’t help but continue picturing the joyous fury on Rin’s face when she attacked Yuuya in the hospital.
[09-Aug-2014 20:10:57]  <Rig> **
[09-Aug-2014 20:12:57]  <ponicalica> "I'm sorry.  I...I let my magic go.  I think I've become more powerful since becoming a Conservator, but I lost my balance.  I shouldn't be attacking so recklessly."
[09-Aug-2014 20:13:41]  <ponicalica> Ayako walks up to the table, grabs something from her purse, and then places on the table a rod about a foot long, covered in various magical runes.
[09-Aug-2014 20:13:55]  <Alicia> Hikari looks from Ayako to Rin to Kazuki, staying silent.
[09-Aug-2014 20:14:26]  <IllFlower> Shii looks up at Ayako with a puzzled expression. "What is this?"
[09-Aug-2014 20:16:14]  <ponicalica> "The elemental wand.  I let myself go out there, and I could have killed someone.  When I was there I could only think of the magic running through my body, and the deceptions Yuuya tried to run.  I don't want more temptation to kill."
[09-Aug-2014 20:17:05]  <ponicalica> "The last few nights I've had trouble sleeping.  I saw his bloodied face each time.  If someone else thinks they can handle that wand's power, they can take it, but I can't."
[09-Aug-2014 20:17:17]  <ponicalica> I hope that wasn't too much.
[09-Aug-2014 20:17:31]  <IllFlower> Shii looks uncomfortably towards the back of the room, at Kazuki.
[09-Aug-2014 20:17:45]  <ponicalica> (also ignore that she didn't actually use the wand but still)
[09-Aug-2014 20:18:46]  <Rig> Kazuki looks back at Shii. “I can see why I was asked to join this team now,” he says.
[09-Aug-2014 20:19:30]  <IllFlower> Shii nods, averting her eyes.
[09-Aug-2014 20:20:20]  <IllFlower> "Right," Shii says, returning her attention to Ayako. "If that's what it takes. I can't hold on to this, but I'll make sure it's turned over to someone who can."
[09-Aug-2014 20:21:03]  <ponicalica> "Thank you."
[09-Aug-2014 20:21:37]  <IllFlower> Shii steps over to the edge of the desk and gently paws the wand into an empty drawer.

[09-Aug-2014 20:24:03]  <IllFlower> "Well," she says, turning back towards the Conservators, "it looks like you all have a grasp of the situation regarding Kinomoto, so I don't have anything to add. I'll be here in case you wish to confer with me, but otherwise you're all free to go."
[09-Aug-2014 20:24:34]  <IllFlower> Her eyes again dart back towards Kazuki.
[09-Aug-2014 20:25:08]  <Alicia> "It's not just you, Ayako..?" Hikari whispers in her direction, making sure Kazuki's out of earshot.
[09-Aug-2014 20:25:28]  <Rig> Kazuki ignores the familiar and steps out the door, leaving the others behind.
[09-Aug-2014 20:25:28]  <ponicalica> "Hm?"
[09-Aug-2014 20:26:38]  <IllFlower> Shii turns around as the others leave, going back to doing whatever it is familiars do.
[09-Aug-2014 20:27:11]  <ponicalica> I think Alicia has one last thing to say
[09-Aug-2014 20:27:15]  <Alicia> "It's just, ever since that day at the trainyard, back with-" Hikari stumbles, not sure how to proceed, given recent events.
[09-Aug-2014 20:27:48]  <Alicia> "... you know, never mind it, Ayako. I think we have other issues at hand, anyway."
[09-Aug-2014 20:28:07]  <ponicalica> "I--Okay.  Yeah."
[09-Aug-2014 20:29:25]  <IllFlower> As Kazuki makes his way down the hall, some distance ahead of the rest of the group, a girl approaching in the other direction calls to him.
[09-Aug-2014 20:30:00]  <IllFlower> "Sakura! Are you free right now?"
[09-Aug-2014 20:30:22]  <Alicia> Hikari eases out, leaving the door open for the rest. Kazuki isn't anywhere to be seen, though she's at a loss for what she would say to him.
[09-Aug-2014 20:30:36]  <ponicalica> ("I just finished glaring at my insane co-workers!")
[09-Aug-2014 20:32:24]  <Rig> IllFlower: Should Kazuki know this girl?
[09-Aug-2014 20:33:34]  <IllFlower> No, she's just a random colleague.
[09-Aug-2014 20:34:08]  <Rig> “Yes,” Kazuki says, glancing behind him briefly. “I’ve got some time."
[09-Aug-2014 20:35:17]  <IllFlower> "A girl came by wanting to talk to a Conservator," the passer-by says. "I have to leave now, but I told her I'd find someone for her. Could you do that for me? She's waiting in the pews out front."
[09-Aug-2014 20:37:15]  <Rig> “Yeah, I need something to take my mind of things. I’ll take care of it."
[09-Aug-2014 20:37:44]  <IllFlower> I hope you're not just going to leave the other three out of the loop. :p
[09-Aug-2014 20:37:59]  <IllFlower> Although I can understand if Kazuki would like them to hang back for a bit.
[09-Aug-2014 20:38:29]  <Alicia> Long as he doesn't have to deal with them, surely.
[09-Aug-2014 20:38:34]  <ponicalica> Should the others catch up to him?
[09-Aug-2014 20:39:14]  <IllFlower> I assume so. We don't split the group, after all.
[09-Aug-2014 20:39:30]  <Rig> Yeah.
[09-Aug-2014 20:42:08]  <Alicia> Hikari manages to find Kazuki, with the others, but decides to wait and stay back, seeing him in conversation with someone else.
[09-Aug-2014 20:42:19]  <Alicia> "Probably another assignment..."
[09-Aug-2014 20:42:57]  <ponicalica> Ayako stands back behind Hikari, nodding.
[09-Aug-2014 20:44:11]  <IllFlower> Just as he was told, there's a girl sitting in the front pew when Kazuki makes his way into the main chamber. Her hair is shoulder-length and a little frilly. She's wearing her usual day clothes; a little unusual on these grounds, where usually initiates are transformed, but not worth much beyond a raised eyebrow.
[09-Aug-2014 20:44:30]  <IllFlower> She seems to be right about Hikari's age.
[09-Aug-2014 20:45:16]  <Rig> Kazuki greets the girl and introduces himself. He knows the others aren’t far behind him.
[09-Aug-2014 20:46:41]  <IllFlower> The girl introduces herself as Narumi Tsuruoka, with a somewhat awkward bow. The name "Tsuruoka" triggers a twinge of recognition on Kazuki's part. Just a twinge, though.
[09-Aug-2014 20:46:58]  <ponicalica> another prophet, probably
[09-Aug-2014 20:47:05]  <ponicalica> well, prophet's kid
[09-Aug-2014 20:47:29]  <Alicia> Hikari eyes the general area that Kazuki went off to, before stopping and facing the others. "I... think we should stick to the sidelines for this one. Ayako, Rin, how do you feel about watching enough to know what's going on, and leaving it to him?"
[09-Aug-2014 20:47:50]  <Alicia> A fair bit more consideration than usual for her, thankfully.
[09-Aug-2014 20:48:05]  <ponicalica> "No, I think we should follow.  If they asked for a Conservator, we should probably be able to ask questions as well as Kazuki."
[09-Aug-2014 20:48:14]  <IllFlower> Is Kazuki going to be the only one liaising? A little boring!
[09-Aug-2014 20:48:54]  <Alicia> Well I meant like two steps back. Interacting, just letting Kazuki lead instead. Doubting he'd want to see the three girls get up in his grill during this time.
[09-Aug-2014 20:49:31]  <IllFlower> Just a second. Something's come up. Be back in under ten.
[09-Aug-2014 20:49:46]  <Rig> “How can we help you?” Kazuki asks as IllFlower leaves to put out more fires.
[09-Aug-2014 20:50:31]  <Alicia> "Right." Hikari nods. "We should be there to contribute too, yes..."
[09-Aug-2014 20:50:56]  <Alicia> (The idea def wasn't sitting out entirely.)
[09-Aug-2014 20:52:07]  <ponicalica> Ayako walks up to the pews behind Kazuki while the girl ponders her words.
[09-Aug-2014 20:55:50]  <ponicalica> okay i'm hearing a loud high pitched noise.  i don't think it's a fire alarm but if it is I'll try to get on IRC and yell about it
[09-Aug-2014 20:56:14]  <ponicalica> okay, don't hear it anymore
[09-Aug-2014 21:00:18]  <IllFlower> Back. Sorry for the sudden interruption.
[09-Aug-2014 21:02:10]  <IllFlower> "My familiar and I have been having a bit of a disagreement," Narumi begins. "I was hoping you might be able to help me argue my case."

[09-Aug-2014 21:04:00]  <IllFlower> "You flunked out of law school!" "Don't tell me how to do my job!" "It's *not* your job!"
[09-Aug-2014 21:04:17]  * IllFlower clears throat
[09-Aug-2014 21:04:35]  <IllFlower> "Where do I start...
[09-Aug-2014 21:05:36]  <IllFlower> "My sister Hatsue died almost a year ago. She was an initiate, like me."
[09-Aug-2014 21:05:44]  <IllFlower> Narumi pauses for a bit to gather her thoughts.
[09-Aug-2014 21:07:27]  <IllFlower> "They were going to hold a memorial service for her, just like the ones they hold for every initiate who dies. Nobody could figure out what had happened to her at first, so..."
[09-Aug-2014 21:07:34]  <Rig> Kazuki gives her a sympathetic look. He’s aware that lots of initiates lose their lives.
[09-Aug-2014 21:09:29]  <IllFlower> She trails off, then: "Eventually they found out that my sister was a sorcerer. A witch killed her during a botched possession ritual."
[09-Aug-2014 21:10:02]  <IllFlower> Narumi looks away. Kazuki remembers now where he'd heard her surname before.
[09-Aug-2014 21:10:36]  <IllFlower> The details are a bit fuzzy to him, but he already knows what Narumi says next.
[09-Aug-2014 21:11:27]  <IllFlower> "They canceled the memorial. The Prophets did her last rites in a closed service. I wasn't allowed in. No one was."
[09-Aug-2014 21:12:03]  <IllFlower> Narumi looks away, biting her lip.
[09-Aug-2014 21:12:30]  <Rig> “I’m sorry,” Kazuki says. He’s still unsure how they can help this girl.
[09-Aug-2014 21:13:58]  <IllFlower> "The first anniversary of her death's coming up next week. I wanted to do at least something small for her. A magical funeral like they do for everyone else.
[09-Aug-2014 21:15:16]  <IllFlower> "My familiar says he won't let me do it, though. He's never even contemplated otherwise."
[09-Aug-2014 21:16:27]  <IllFlower> Kazuki nods. The Order's always come down hard on cult leaders, even in death.
[09-Aug-2014 21:17:43]  <Rig> Kazuki knows that the familiar is in the right though. The Order would forbid it. He still felt bad though. This girl just wanted to honor her sister, despite the things she’d done.
[09-Aug-2014 21:17:50]  <IllFlower> "He says it might attract the wrong kind of attention from her old followers."
[09-Aug-2014 21:18:18]  <IllFlower> Narumi shakes her head in frustration, clearly unconvinced that this is a likely outcome.
[09-Aug-2014 21:18:19]  <Rig> He thought about how he would feel if Yuuya was dead. He’d want a service for him, despite of the things he did.
[09-Aug-2014 21:19:59]  <IllFlower> "So I was hoping you might be able to convince him otherwise. You know, since familiars have to answer to the Conservators.
[09-Aug-2014 21:20:15]  <IllFlower> "I just want a chance to finally say good-bye, you know?"
[09-Aug-2014 21:21:05]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at the girl. She seems like she’s moments away from crying. “I understand,” he says.
[09-Aug-2014 21:21:33]  <Rig> He looks over his shoulder at his group before turning back to Narumi. “We’ll do what we can.”
[09-Aug-2014 21:21:58]  <IllFlower> "Thank you," Narumi says softly.
[09-Aug-2014 21:24:14]  <IllFlower> She bows again and prepares to leave the old church.
[09-Aug-2014 21:25:36]  <Rig> Kazuki stands and waits until she’s out the door before heading over to his group. He explains Narumi’s request to them.
[09-Aug-2014 21:25:54]  <Rig> “The problem is, her familiar is right. There can’t be a service for her sister.”
[09-Aug-2014 21:27:19]  <ponicalica> "I agree.  If her cultists are still out there, they'll get exactly those wrong messages."
[09-Aug-2014 21:28:16]  <Rig> “Still, is it right to tell initiates that they can’t honor their family members?"

[09-Aug-2014 21:30:11]  <BGTB2005> "If any of her cultists show up we'll deal with them as we encounter them."
[09-Aug-2014 21:30:35]  <Alicia> "No, it really isn't. It might not need to be a big service, though..."
[09-Aug-2014 21:30:38]  <Rig> “I don’t think that’s really a solution.” Kazuki says flatly.
[09-Aug-2014 21:30:45]  <ponicalica> "As Conservators, our job is to fix problems, not create them, Rin."
[09-Aug-2014 21:32:37]  <Alicia> "The best course of action would be to make sure the cultists know nothing about this. Assuming we can convince her familiar."
[09-Aug-2014 21:32:49]  <IllFlower> Not the gunslinging types, I see.

[09-Aug-2014 21:33:19]  <Alicia> Not for a service.
[09-Aug-2014 21:33:19]  <Rig> “Secret rituals don’t solve problems either, Hikari."
[09-Aug-2014 21:33:31]  <Rig> “But it’s a place to start…"
[09-Aug-2014 21:34:23]  <IllFlower> A secret memorial would at least solve Narumi's problem.
[09-Aug-2014 21:34:34]  <IllFlower> Whether it'll cause other ones, who knows.
[09-Aug-2014 21:35:22]  <Rig> We should talk to the familiar about what’s going on first.
[09-Aug-2014 21:35:33]  <ponicalica> yeah
[09-Aug-2014 21:35:55]  <Alicia> Yeah, it'd be good to convince them.
[09-Aug-2014 21:37:10]  <IllFlower> Shall we, then?
[09-Aug-2014 21:39:04]  <Alicia> Yes.
[09-Aug-2014 21:40:08]  <IllFlower> Narumi's familiar is based in the hollowed-out concrete core of what used to be an apartment building. The Conservators know familiars have a predilection for places that are, let's say, not quite fresh, but the gray shell is imposing even with that in consideration.
[09-Aug-2014 21:42:46]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun appears to be entertaining something of a crowd when the Conservators arrive. One of them, a boy about Narumi's age, gives them a knowing nod as they enter the room.
[09-Aug-2014 21:43:16]  <IllFlower> Aside from a television in one corner, and a phone in another, there is precious little here.
[09-Aug-2014 21:43:39]  <Rig> Kazuki is convinced that familiars all order furniture from the same catalog.
[09-Aug-2014 21:43:52]  <IllFlower> Or don't order furniture, as the case may be.
[09-Aug-2014 21:45:24]  <ponicalica> ("WHAT DID YOU DO TO YUNA")
[09-Aug-2014 21:46:39]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun glances up at his new guests. "Right, you're all dismissed," he says to the three of his initiates present. "Youichi" -- by which Pyunpyun means the boy -- "I'll see you again tomorrow."
[09-Aug-2014 21:47:57]  <IllFlower> Youichi gives Kazuki a little punch in the shoulder as he walks out. "Give 'em hell," he says, before making his way through the door and down the stairs.
[09-Aug-2014 21:48:32]  <ponicalica> Ayako lets Kazuki lead.  He's shown himself rather good at negotiation, and besides, Ayako's not entirely convinced the "secret ritual" is a good idea.
[09-Aug-2014 21:49:31]  <Rig> Kazuki is a little surprised at boy’s punch, but ignores it and approaches the familiar.
[09-Aug-2014 21:51:54]  <Rig> “One of your initiates came to the Conservators today with a request. I’m sure you already know what she asked.”
[09-Aug-2014 21:53:12]  <IllFlower> "Yes," Pyunpyun says. "Narumi's got perseverance, I'll give you that."
[09-Aug-2014 21:53:58]  <Rig> “I didn’t want to bring it up to her, but I’d like to know more about what happened to her sister.”
[09-Aug-2014 21:54:27]  <ponicalica> ("She was working with this Bosnian refugee...")
[09-Aug-2014 21:54:57]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[09-Aug-2014 21:56:28]  <IllFlower> Rig: Anything you want to know in particular?
[09-Aug-2014 21:56:36]  <IllFlower> Or anyone wants to know, really?
[09-Aug-2014 21:56:47]  <Rig> How was it determined that she was a sorceror and who found that out?
[09-Aug-2014 21:57:20]  <ponicalica> (How much do we know of) what was she doing?
[09-Aug-2014 21:58:13]  <ponicalica> by what she was doing, I mean, like, her sorcery, doctrine, etc.
[09-Aug-2014 21:59:43]  <IllFlower> "Hatsue was running a small cult behind the scenes. Her particular motivation wasn't all that clear, but it seems like curiosity got the better of her, and once she realized what she was doing she made to bury it as quickly as possible.
[09-Aug-2014 22:00:14]  <IllFlower> "I don't think even Narumi knew. We only found out after an investigation. A magical autopsy, if you will."
[09-Aug-2014 22:01:28]  <Rig> Kazuki nods. “And then her memorial was cancelled.”
[09-Aug-2014 22:01:37]  <Rig> “Do you believe members of her cult are still around?"
[09-Aug-2014 22:03:34]  <IllFlower> "Almost certainly. Being alive gives you the advantage of being able to conceal your tracks. They may not have been consciously acting out of malice at first, but by now the ones that are left will have dug in their heels.
[09-Aug-2014 22:04:29]  <IllFlower> "The saving grace right now is that all of them believe that it's too dangerous to regroup. If Narumi goes ahead with her plans, though, that may be all the validation they need to form a new cult."
[09-Aug-2014 22:04:49]  <ponicalica> "Do you think a...private ceremony...would escape their notice?"  The hesitation is clear in Ayako's voice.
[09-Aug-2014 22:06:43]  <IllFlower> "And if one of them did find out? The consequences would be even worse than if we didn't allow it in the first place. Coverups are rarely worth the price of being exposed."
[09-Aug-2014 22:08:35]  <Rig> Kazuki nods.
[09-Aug-2014 22:08:46]  <Rig> “However, Narumi is rather persistent. She needs some kind of closure."
[09-Aug-2014 22:09:07]  <Rig> “If she goes off and does this by herself it will be more dangerous than anything we could do."
[09-Aug-2014 22:09:54]  <IllFlower> "That's not really a hypothetical," Pyunpyun says. "It's clear to me that she's willing to hold a ceremony with or without my approval. The rituals aren't hard to learn, after all."
[09-Aug-2014 22:11:18]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun's voice hardens. "At that point, I may have to preemptively strip her of her powers. On a temporary basis, at least, until the anniversary passes. I'd rather not do it, but if that's the only choice, then so be it."
[09-Aug-2014 22:11:37]  <ponicalica> "Do you think she'll actually accept being stripped of her powers?"
[09-Aug-2014 22:11:42]  <Rig> Kazuki looks around the room, gathering his thoughts. “I think that may be too harsh and too sudden.”

[09-Aug-2014 22:12:23]  <IllFlower> "No, but what other choices do we have?"
[09-Aug-2014 22:12:25]  <Rig> “At the very least we should try to talk her out of it before resorting to something that will almost certainly make her resent the Order.”
[09-Aug-2014 22:13:29]  <Rig> Kazuki looks to the girls for approval of this plan.
[09-Aug-2014 22:13:41]  <IllFlower> "I don't want her to, either, but at least she won't have any way to act out against us.
[09-Aug-2014 22:13:52]  <IllFlower> "It may not be fair, but it is feasible."
[09-Aug-2014 22:15:38]  <Alicia> "I think we should talk to her too. It wouldn't be a good idea to let her put herself and others at risk."
[09-Aug-2014 22:15:51]  <Rig> Kazuki frowns. “Maybe, but we’ll speak to her first. If there is no other option we’ll let you do it your way.”
[09-Aug-2014 22:16:29]  <IllFlower> "Of course."
[09-Aug-2014 22:17:27]  <Rig> So, shall we go track down Narumi and tell her that she can’t have a memorial for her sister?
[09-Aug-2014 22:17:37]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun looks out of the window - or perhaps "hole" would be a better word, now that it's been stripped of its glass panes.
[09-Aug-2014 22:17:54]  <Alicia> Let's go to Narumi, yeah.
[09-Aug-2014 22:17:56]  <IllFlower> "I hope it won't come to that end."
[09-Aug-2014 22:18:29]  <ponicalica> Ayako nods.
[09-Aug-2014 22:18:32]  <IllFlower> Okay, the Conservators make their way out of the building.
[09-Aug-2014 22:19:24]  <IllFlower> To their surprise, who should they find standing around and chatting down on the ground floor but the initiates Pyunpyun was talking to earlier.
[09-Aug-2014 22:20:38]  <IllFlower> "How'd it go?" the boy Youichi asks. His tone is irreverent and a bit overly casual.
[09-Aug-2014 22:20:39]  <ponicalica> (does one of them have inexplicably pink hair)
[09-Aug-2014 22:20:57]  <ponicalica> ("nah, sumire got herself killed")
[09-Aug-2014 22:21:19]  <IllFlower> The other two girls are there, girls, but you can fill in whichever ones you want.
[09-Aug-2014 22:22:12]  <Rig> “Is your familiar always so… dramatic?” Kazuki asks.

[09-Aug-2014 22:25:11]  <IllFlower> Youichi laughs. "He's a bit old school. If familiars had childhoods, I'd say he probably read The Inferno one time too many when he was growing up.
[09-Aug-2014 22:25:40]  <IllFlower> "He's not one for going soft on transgressions, that's for sure."
[09-Aug-2014 22:26:04]  <Rig> “Sounds like someone we know."
[09-Aug-2014 22:26:17]  <Rig> “Do you know where Narumi might be?"
[09-Aug-2014 22:26:35]  <ponicalica> "Unfortunately, he's probably right.  If Narumi performed her ritual now, especially with the blessings of the Conservators, it could be seen as an endorsement of her sister's cult."
[09-Aug-2014 22:27:39]  <IllFlower> "I figured you were here about her. God knows she hasn't had it rough enough already.
[09-Aug-2014 22:29:04]  <IllFlower> "Well, God knows Pyunpyun's not gonna budge. If Narumi and me and all of her other friends haven't been able to persuade him, nothing will.

[09-Aug-2014 22:30:00]  <ponicalica> Alicia, BGTB2005: what do Hikari and Rin think
[09-Aug-2014 22:30:22]  <IllFlower> "She deserves *something*, don't you think?"
[09-Aug-2014 22:30:49]  <Rig> “She deserves something, sure. But we have to consider the greater scope of things."
[09-Aug-2014 22:32:36]  <IllFlower> "It's like you said. Pyunpyun's just being dramatic. Surely she can just do something in private."
[09-Aug-2014 22:33:31]  <Rig> “Maybe, but does it have to be something magic? Can’t she just light a candle at a shrine and pray to her sister’s memory?”
[09-Aug-2014 22:33:40]  <Alicia> "But at what risk? She definitely deserves something to honor her sister, but with the cultists being out there and it being so recent..."
[09-Aug-2014 22:35:42]  <IllFlower> "You know it's not that simple. Maybe if Narumi didn't know anything about magic, a candle would be enough, but everyone knows the rites dead initiates usually get. She's not going to be happy unless she knows her sister's gotten them.
[09-Aug-2014 22:35:54]  <IllFlower> "You're telling me you wouldn't feel the same way if it was your sister?"
[09-Aug-2014 22:36:17]  <ponicalica> I kind of think this might be conflict worthy
[09-Aug-2014 22:36:33]  <Rig> Yeah. I was thinking that too.
[09-Aug-2014 22:36:33]  <IllFlower> Over what?
[09-Aug-2014 22:36:44]  <Rig> Convincing the initiates that a ceremony is too risky.
[09-Aug-2014 22:36:59]  <Alicia> Mhm.
[09-Aug-2014 22:37:13]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: which side do you want to enter this on, or do you want to enter at all?
[09-Aug-2014 22:37:35]  <IllFlower> All right, give me a moment to put some numbers together.
[09-Aug-2014 22:38:25]  <BGTB2005> Rin wants to let Narumi go through with a secret ceremony
[09-Aug-2014 22:38:41]  <IllFlower> (I had the MB character sheet open for a bit. I'm really struggling to think of any characters who wouldn't have jumped into the conversation by now.)
[09-Aug-2014 22:39:17]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: So is she just going to hang back, or is she going to weigh in?
[09-Aug-2014 22:39:18]  <ponicalica> Maybe time has changed them to become slightly more passive?
[09-Aug-2014 22:39:52]  <IllFlower> (Passive? I dunno about that... Like, say, a passive Makoto? Uh...)
[09-Aug-2014 22:40:12]  <IllFlower> This fits my mental model of Rin, incidentally. Which is still a secret!
[09-Aug-2014 22:40:17]  <Alicia> `-`
[09-Aug-2014 22:43:03]  <BGTB2005> I think she'd try and weigh in
[09-Aug-2014 22:43:57]  <IllFlower> All right, so that'd ally her with Youichi and the others.
[09-Aug-2014 22:44:35]  <IllFlower> I have numbers rolled up, so we can get started.
[09-Aug-2014 22:44:38]  <ponicalica> "Girl A" Radiohead? ;)
[09-Aug-2014 22:44:48]  <IllFlower> Rin might want to let the other Conservators know what's up, though.
[09-Aug-2014 22:45:42]  <ponicalica> Maybe that could be the first raise.  "Actually, I don't agree." etc.
[09-Aug-2014 22:45:59]  <IllFlower> Well, someone's gotta raise, haha.
[09-Aug-2014 22:46:20]  <BGTB2005> Ac + Ht, right?

[09-Aug-2014 22:48:27]  <IllFlower> Is that at stake?

[09-Aug-2014 22:49:02]  <ponicalica> So we should all roll for our Rin relationship?
[09-Aug-2014 22:49:07]  <BGTB2005> so, uh...
[09-Aug-2014 22:49:16]  <IllFlower> Hold on just a second...
[09-Aug-2014 22:50:24]  <ponicalica> ?
[09-Aug-2014 22:50:48]  <IllFlower> I think just a relationship with the Conservators isn't enough, because Rin doesn't have sufficient authority in that institution.
[09-Aug-2014 22:50:56]  <Rig> Kay

[09-Aug-2014 22:53:50]  <Rig> I’m good with that.
[09-Aug-2014 22:54:01]  <Alicia> Yah.
[09-Aug-2014 22:54:41]  <BGTB2005> could I build off "You're telling me you wouldn't feel the same way if it was your sister?", given Rin's relationship with Chiaki?
[09-Aug-2014 22:55:16]  <BGTB2005> probably not enough to bring in that relationship, but it would influence her position

[09-Aug-2014 23:28:01]  <ponicalica> Rig: Omnipresence preferred emburst, clearly
[09-Aug-2014 23:28:48]  <IllFlower> Remember when I rolled 19 damage and nearly killed half the group? Fun times.
[09-Aug-2014 23:29:07]  <Alicia> Jesus.
[09-Aug-2014 23:29:21]  <ponicalica> Remember when you had to reroll and use Kaede as a deus ex machina?

[09-Aug-2014 23:32:21]  <IllFlower> Yeah. That was the same battle where I rolled the 19 damage.
[09-Aug-2014 23:32:33]  <IllFlower> There were some pretty ridiculous rolls.
[09-Aug-2014 23:33:11]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: tell us what you're thinking
[09-Aug-2014 23:34:10]  <BGTB2005> I'm thinking of Rin saying something about fending off the cultists if they come after Narumi, but I'm not sure they're going to be why Narumi would be in danger
[09-Aug-2014 23:34:39]  <IllFlower> That doesn't actually matter. It's an argument. You just need something that sounds right.
[09-Aug-2014 23:35:10]  <Alicia> Snicker.
[09-Aug-2014 23:36:06]  <ponicalica> if you think it's a weak counter, just use more dice
[09-Aug-2014 23:36:56]  <IllFlower> I have an idea for something building off of that, as well.
[09-Aug-2014 23:38:30]  <IllFlower> So I can chip in to make it more forceful if that's okay.
[09-Aug-2014 23:39:01]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005?
[09-Aug-2014 23:39:23]  <BGTB2005> "If the cultists take the ceremony as a sign to threaten Narumi, then we'll make sure they can't harm her."
[09-Aug-2014 23:39:55]  <BGTB2005> not sure if I can roll any traits with that
[09-Aug-2014 23:40:18]  <IllFlower> Gotta find a way to make her really blunt next time.
[09-Aug-2014 23:40:38]  <Rig> You could roll sticking to strengths.
[09-Aug-2014 23:40:39]  <IllFlower> Like "battering ram against the skull" blunt.
[09-Aug-2014 23:40:43]  <Rig> Force and more force.
[09-Aug-2014 23:40:49]  <ponicalica> Rig: that would require her punch someone I think
[09-Aug-2014 23:41:03]  <IllFlower> That one's more for when she starts trying to incapacitate people, yeah.

[09-Aug-2014 23:47:37]  <IllFlower> One of the other initiates, a girl, speaks up. "Narumi knows that what her sister did was wrong. She's not just going to sit there and let her memorial be overrun by the people who contributed to Hatsue's death in the first place."
[09-Aug-2014 23:48:02]  <IllFlower> I'm gonna call that girl the good friend and roll her trait die.

[09-Aug-2014 23:50:59]  <Rig> I think the best response is to try to explain that it isn’t about protecting the memorial from being overrun.
[09-Aug-2014 23:51:05]  <ponicalica> Yeah, pretty much
[09-Aug-2014 23:51:06]  <Rig> It’s about the message that gets sent.
[09-Aug-2014 23:51:08]  <ponicalica> I could say something
[09-Aug-2014 23:51:21]  <Alicia> And about not bringing more conflict that could worsen the situation.
[09-Aug-2014 23:51:43]  <Alicia> I could also roll one of my 2d6s and see if somethign can be made out of that.
[09-Aug-2014 23:52:06]  <ponicalica> Alicia: Do you want to talk then?
[09-Aug-2014 23:52:15]  <Alicia> Up for it.
[09-Aug-2014 23:52:36]  <ponicalica> awesome
[09-Aug-2014 23:53:11]  <Alicia> So, mind if I roll for the feelings one?
[09-Aug-2014 23:53:18]  <IllFlower> You should write up your response first.
[09-Aug-2014 23:53:26]  <Alicia> Okay.
[09-Aug-2014 23:53:40]  <IllFlower> It's easier to judge what traits fit well that way.
[09-Aug-2014 23:54:19]  <IllFlower> Looks like Kazuki's out of luck on dice, though.
[09-Aug-2014 23:57:05]  <Rig> Well, I could respond and try to roll something better.
[09-Aug-2014 23:57:23]  <Alicia> No I've got stuff, just working on not sounding awkward.
[09-Aug-2014 23:57:31]  <IllFlower> Rig: I'm not sure what you could roll, though.
[09-Aug-2014 23:57:33]  <ponicalica> don't worry about not sounding awkward
[09-Aug-2014 23:57:39]  <ponicalica> Hikari sounds stilted most of the time anyways
[09-Aug-2014 23:58:10]  <Rig> I could try to manipulate the conversation away from how stupid these initiates are “We’ll just fight the cultists!” and to the fact that that’s not what the issue is.
[09-Aug-2014 23:58:16]  <Alicia> "This isn't about ruining her memorial, is what you don't understand. It's about not bringing more distress to the Order than is necessary, which is exactly what you people would be doing."
[09-Aug-2014 23:58:27]  <Alicia> ponicalica: I'm not sure if that's about me, Hikari, or both. >_>
[09-Aug-2014 23:58:29]  <Alicia> (Both.)
[09-Aug-2014 23:59:49]  <Alicia> (And was thinking of bringing in 2d6 feelings.)

[10-Aug-2014 00:00:19]  <IllFlower> That'd be more of "the Order is more important than one girl's problems, okay?"
[10-Aug-2014 00:00:43]  <Rig> Well, that falls into “the law” part, right?
[10-Aug-2014 00:00:45]  <Alicia> So law.
[10-Aug-2014 00:01:27]  <IllFlower> "The law" would be kinda like "you've gotta go through me first," I thought.
[10-Aug-2014 00:01:41]  <IllFlower> Well, it's the same dice anyway.
[10-Aug-2014 00:01:55]  <Alicia> Hikari sees herself as representative of the law, which would be the Order here. Don't go against the Order.
[10-Aug-2014 00:01:58]  <IllFlower> Kanye is perfect for this conversation.
[10-Aug-2014 00:02:47]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Well, it's not a big deal either way. Let's roll some dice!

[10-Aug-2014 00:26:42]  <Rig> Basically, we need to convince them that this isn’t a punishment for Narumi. This isn’t about her dead sister. It’s about the living cultists.
[10-Aug-2014 00:27:40]  <ponicalica> "And if we held a ceremony, especially one that the Conservators were at, it could tell them that their actions are okay even by our rules.  You think they wouldn't come out then?"

[10-Aug-2014 00:33:30]  <ponicalica> I think Rin might have to give, unless she wants to punch Ayako in her pretentious face

[10-Aug-2014 00:34:51]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005 could try being blunt.
[10-Aug-2014 00:35:09]  <IllFlower> If that works out I can toss him a die for his next raise.

[10-Aug-2014 00:54:04]  <BGTB2005> when has rin ever cared about consequences?
[10-Aug-2014 00:54:14]  <Alicia> ... point.
[10-Aug-2014 00:54:28]  <Rig> I want to offer a compromise to the initiates, but I need to do it in two steps. I need to see this raise

[10-Aug-2014 00:55:11]  <IllFlower> If it's a compromise, it can probably be done separately.
[10-Aug-2014 00:55:14]  <Rig> Then I raise with the compromise.
[10-Aug-2014 00:55:28]  <Rig> But I need to roll for picking battles with this see.
[10-Aug-2014 00:55:41]  <Rig> “We’re trying to do our job. You’re obstructing us by wanting to perform a ceremony of remembrance for a cult leader. This isn’t about Narumi.” Kazuki takes a breath. “Let’s make a compromise.” (Is this good enough for a see?)

[10-Aug-2014 00:56:37]  <Omnipresence> 14: Rolled 4 4 = 8. Bank now has 1 3 4 4 = 12.
[10-Aug-2014 00:56:49]  <IllFlower> Rig: I mean, I think you can still propose it even if you give. A compromise would be separate stakes.
[10-Aug-2014 00:57:12]  <Rig> So, I give and we launch a follow up immediately?
[10-Aug-2014 00:57:12]  <IllFlower> Unless the compromise still involves not having a ceremony.
[10-Aug-2014 00:57:27]  <Rig> It involves the initiates not being involved in the ceremony.
[10-Aug-2014 00:58:04]  <IllFlower> Yeah, you can do that. Go ahead and just say that first before rolling any new dice.
[10-Aug-2014 00:58:14]  <Alicia> Sweet.
[10-Aug-2014 00:59:32]  <Rig> “We’ll try to get Narumi access to her sister’s remains and let her have a private ceremony, but it has to be just her. No one else,” Kazuki says. He makes sure to meet each initiate’s eyes. He wants them to know this is their only option.
[10-Aug-2014 00:59:35]  <IllFlower> I thought picking battles was more about trying not to punch folks anyway.
[10-Aug-2014 01:00:21]  <Rig> Maybe, it’s hard to see how it comes in when we have such defined stakes and everything though.
[10-Aug-2014 01:00:30]  <Rig> Because changing the battle means a new conflict.
[10-Aug-2014 01:00:43]  <Rig> And it would only really come up when Kazuki is gonna give.
[10-Aug-2014 01:01:05]  <Rig> So, it works really well when it’s Kazuki’s turn to raise and he can carry the highest dice over.
[10-Aug-2014 01:01:12]  <Rig> But it’s pointless in any other situation.
[10-Aug-2014 01:01:59]  <Rig> Anyway, I’m kinda stretching past the time I have at this point. Any chance of wrapping this up in the next 15 minutes or can we pause until next time?
[10-Aug-2014 01:02:03]  <IllFlower> It's more like a way to get more dice without escalating, I'd think.
[10-Aug-2014 01:02:15]  <IllFlower> "This guy's not worth it, I can still talk him down."
[10-Aug-2014 01:02:22]  <IllFlower> Anyway, yeah, let's continue.
[10-Aug-2014 01:03:11]  <Alicia> Mmm.
[10-Aug-2014 01:03:32]  <ponicalica> Mmm.
[10-Aug-2014 01:03:33]  <IllFlower> "Oh, that's fine," the girl who had spoken first earlier says. "I wasn't under the impression that Narumi would be allowed to hold a ceremony with very many guests at all. I don't think anyone was.
[10-Aug-2014 01:04:03]  <IllFlower> "She needs *something*, though. Even if it's just her and an adept.
[10-Aug-2014 01:04:16]  <IllFlower> "I'd feel sorry for her if she couldn't have even that."
[10-Aug-2014 01:04:38]  <IllFlower> Youichi looks a little less than impressed at this, but he doesn't object outright.
[10-Aug-2014 01:04:50]  <Rig> Kazuki sighs. “I know,” he says. “Everyone needs something to get them by.”
[10-Aug-2014 01:05:18]  <Rig> “We really do just want what’s best for her and everyone.”

[10-Aug-2014 01:10:05]  <ponicalica> Yeah.  I'm considering the "leaving the scene" myself, actually, if that doesn't conflict.
[10-Aug-2014 01:10:08]  <Alicia> And I'm thinking about my long-term.
[10-Aug-2014 01:10:25]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Leaving the scene?
[10-Aug-2014 01:10:45]  <ponicalica> Ayako's annoyed at Kazuki's attempt at diplomacy, etc, but knows she's lost.
[10-Aug-2014 01:11:03]  <IllFlower> Well, nobody's launching a follow-up conflict, so I think that works.
[10-Aug-2014 01:11:06]  <Alicia> Ah.
[10-Aug-2014 01:11:18]  <IllFlower> Of course, we'll all have to roleplay our annoyance.
[10-Aug-2014 01:11:51]  <IllFlower> That also means Ayako will be out of the proceedings when we start again, since we're probably going to close on this scene.
[10-Aug-2014 01:12:05]  <Rig> Yeah, that conflict went poorly.
[10-Aug-2014 01:12:17]  <BGTB2005> I'm thinking a short term 2d6 -> 2d4 relationship with Hikari?
[10-Aug-2014 01:12:27]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Works.
[10-Aug-2014 01:12:46]  <Alicia> I'm considering taking a new trait about believing she's in the right/knows her position about these things, but that sounds too similar to others...
[10-Aug-2014 01:12:48]  <ponicalica> Ayako glares at Kazuki as he begins to negotiate with Pyunpyun's charges.

[10-Aug-2014 01:12:53]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Buttercupistiny
[10-Aug-2014 01:13:03]  <Alicia> With Ayako leaving the scene, I don't think also leaving would be good.
[10-Aug-2014 01:13:11]  <Alicia> Or, hm...
[10-Aug-2014 01:13:20]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking I'll close out Pyunpyun's initiates first before anything else.
[10-Aug-2014 01:13:26]  <Alicia> Okay.
[10-Aug-2014 01:13:36]  <BGTB2005> I believe I also have experience
[10-Aug-2014 01:13:42]  <ponicalica> She doesn't like seeing what she sees as letting disaster happen, and an image, with some peculiar green and purple highlights, of Jun's dead body "graces" her thoughts.
[10-Aug-2014 01:13:45]  <IllFlower> Alicia: You can't take that as long-term fallout anyway.
[10-Aug-2014 01:13:48]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: same, but we can do that later
[10-Aug-2014 01:14:06]  <Alicia> IllFlower: You're right. I was scrolling through the pages and got mixed up.
[10-Aug-2014 01:14:43]  <ponicalica> Ayako almost feels like punching Jun, but knows that if she does, it would just make everything even worse.
[10-Aug-2014 01:15:03]  <IllFlower> Especially because that would involve digging up Jun's grave.
[10-Aug-2014 01:15:06]  <BGTB2005> are you sure you meant Jun and not Rin?
[10-Aug-2014 01:15:21]  <Alicia> Kazuki is already Kazuki, punching him wouldn't help.
[10-Aug-2014 01:15:24]  <IllFlower> Alicia: What're you going to take?
[10-Aug-2014 01:15:50]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: I meant Kazuki.  Definitely not Jun.  Got my names way mixed up.  >_<
[10-Aug-2014 01:16:00]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Get rid of a belonging, like the knife?
[10-Aug-2014 01:16:11]  <ponicalica> Also Ayako would never punch Jun-sama :p
[10-Aug-2014 01:16:13]  <IllFlower> Alicia: I recommend bumping down "I'm the law" from 2d6 to 1d6. But that's just me.
[10-Aug-2014 01:16:35]  <Rig> Yeah, that feels appropriate.
[10-Aug-2014 01:16:46]  <Rig> Losing a belonging just doesn’t really match what happened.
[10-Aug-2014 01:17:00]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[10-Aug-2014 01:17:03]  <Alicia> I'll do that.
[10-Aug-2014 01:17:15]  <ponicalica> Should Ayako leave now or should I let IllFlower go first?
[10-Aug-2014 01:17:21]  <Alicia> Alas, Hikari, sometimes people simply won't listen to you!
[10-Aug-2014 01:17:24]  <IllFlower> I'll go first.
[10-Aug-2014 01:17:32]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Press Enter. :p
[10-Aug-2014 01:17:53]  <Alicia> I thought I did.
[10-Aug-2014 01:18:30]  <IllFlower> "Well, I'm glad we got that little misunderstanding sorted out," Youichi says in an annoyed voice. "At least something got accomplished.
[10-Aug-2014 01:18:40]  <BGTB2005> heh, most of Rin's named relationships are d4s
[10-Aug-2014 01:18:51]  <BGTB2005> even though one is short-term
[10-Aug-2014 01:18:53]  <IllFlower> "I don't know about you, but I think it's about time we took our leave. Good luck."
[10-Aug-2014 01:19:19]  <Rig> Kazuki resists the urge to sneer at the retreating Youichi.
[10-Aug-2014 01:19:31]  <IllFlower> Youichi's well-wishes don't exactly come out sounding all that supportive.
[10-Aug-2014 01:19:58]  <ponicalica> everyone beating up on Kazuki in their heads
[10-Aug-2014 01:20:14]  <Alicia> Well he's Kazuki.
[10-Aug-2014 01:20:15]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun's initiates head off, leaving the Conservators alone in front of that concrete husk of a building.
[10-Aug-2014 01:20:34]  <IllFlower> Hey, we made it through a talky conflict!
[10-Aug-2014 01:20:49]  <Rig> Without punching!
[10-Aug-2014 01:21:00]  <IllFlower> Solid!
[10-Aug-2014 01:21:03]  <Rig> I mean, it didn’t work out really well for anyone.
[10-Aug-2014 01:21:13]  <BGTB2005> There was the one with Yumiko, but I'm not sure if it counts?
[10-Aug-2014 01:21:16]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Okey-doke, your go.
[10-Aug-2014 01:21:22]  <IllFlower> Rig: "Sticks and stones" etc.
[10-Aug-2014 01:22:47]  <ponicalica> "You...they...I...I need to be alone.  Good luck."  Ayako's well-wishes sound about as supportive as Youichi's.
[10-Aug-2014 01:23:26]  <ponicalica> She then turns around, and walks out of Pyunpyun's home base.
[10-Aug-2014 01:23:29]  <Rig> Kazuki is surprised that Ayako is so unsupportive. It was a conclusion. Not even one they technically needed to hold up.
[10-Aug-2014 01:24:28]  <IllFlower> ("Fat lot of good your magical diplomacy did there!")
[10-Aug-2014 01:24:50]  <Rig> Shall we call this wrapped up?
[10-Aug-2014 01:24:57]  <IllFlower> Anyone have anything they want to say?
[10-Aug-2014 01:25:04]  <ponicalica> I think I also have an XP fallout but I don't know what to spend it on.
[10-Aug-2014 01:25:09]  <Alicia> Hikari looks at Ayako sympathetically, before staring back at Kazuki and Rin. Of course it would go like this with him...
[10-Aug-2014 01:25:18]  <IllFlower> I imagine Ayako's leaving in a huff overrode any awkward antagonism between Rin and the others.
[10-Aug-2014 01:25:24]  <IllFlower> Isn't that great?
[10-Aug-2014 01:25:33]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at his two remaining colleagues.
[10-Aug-2014 01:25:48]  <ponicalica> Actually, I want to amend her exit as brushing against Rin as she leaves, if possible.
[10-Aug-2014 01:26:04]  <ponicalica> disdain levels maximum
[10-Aug-2014 01:26:16]  <Rig> “That went… let’s just find Narumi and deal with this.”
[10-Aug-2014 01:26:35]  <Alicia> "Lead the way, Kazuki."
[10-Aug-2014 01:27:30]  <IllFlower> Okay, I think that's a suitably abrupt close to this session. Let's drop the curtains on this one.
[10-Aug-2014 01:27:40]  <IllFlower> Those of you with experience fallout can work on that now.
[10-Aug-2014 01:27:50]  <IllFlower> Otherwise, thanks for playing, everyone. See you next week.
