[16-May-2015 23:04:51]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Emsnacks
[16-May-2015 23:04:53]  <Rig> Technically it's a berry, I think.
[16-May-2015 23:04:53]  <Alicia> I have unending despair
[16-May-2015 23:05:06]  <Rig> Alicia: You should wait until we start to have that.
[16-May-2015 23:05:13]  <Alicia> Endless, whatevs.
[16-May-2015 23:05:17]  <Alicia> Rig: Good point.
[16-May-2015 23:05:34]  <IllFlower> So, when we left our heroes, they were on their way to visit a certain Kazuki's mother.
[16-May-2015 23:05:48]  <Rig> Are there many other Kazukis?
[16-May-2015 23:06:01]  <Rig> Infinite Kazuki Works.
[16-May-2015 23:06:02]  <IllFlower> How do we want to play this?
[16-May-2015 23:06:16]  <Calica> Rig: IIRC it's a rather common name in Japan and that's why IllFlower chose it
[16-May-2015 23:06:16]  <Rig> I think Kazuki said that other people had to take the lead on this.
[16-May-2015 23:06:29]  <IllFlower> The initiates could make a house call, meet in a cafe, become death, destroyer of worlds...
[16-May-2015 23:07:03]  <Rig> The last one sounds good.
[16-May-2015 23:07:05]  <Calica> I sort of think either calling her into neutral territory like a cafe or cornering her at school would make the most sense
[16-May-2015 23:07:19]  <BGTB2005> cafe sounds good?
[16-May-2015 23:07:23]  <Alicia> Let's bring the enemy into more helpful grounds like the cafe.
[16-May-2015 23:07:38]  <Rig> Helpful grounds? Cafe?
[16-May-2015 23:07:48]  <IllFlower> Coffee grounds?
[16-May-2015 23:07:53]  <Alicia> Insofar as it's not "enemy territory"
[16-May-2015 23:07:57]  <Rig> Puns.
[16-May-2015 23:08:02]  <Rig> Anyway, cafe seems to be the vote.
[16-May-2015 23:08:10]  * IllFlower throws a set of cymbals down the stairs
[16-May-2015 23:08:13]  <Alicia> Oh. Heh. I rule.
[16-May-2015 23:08:34]  <BGTB2005> though wasn't Kazuki's mom going to visit Chiaki?
[16-May-2015 23:08:56]  <IllFlower> Because that'd be a good place to have an awkward reunion, Chiaki's house.
[16-May-2015 23:09:52]  <IllFlower> The initiates call Kazuki's mother and ask her to a cafe. She's understandably confused given the lack of detail in their request, but ultimately accepts.
[16-May-2015 23:10:32]  <Rig> They gave no names, as usual.
[16-May-2015 23:11:38]  <Calica> our next game should have magic put a big emphasis on True Name stuff so that this will either stop being brought up or be brought up even more
[16-May-2015 23:12:16]  <IllFlower> The winter night's already gotten underway by the time the initiates get to the small coffee shop by the school. They're all a bit early, at Hikari's insistence, so Miss Kataoka's not arrived yet.
[16-May-2015 23:12:38]  <IllFlower> This would be the perfect time for Kazuki to figure out how he's going to act.
[16-May-2015 23:12:57]  <Rig> Well, my personal challenge still stands.
[16-May-2015 23:13:00]  <IllFlower> Or to pretend like nothing's bothering him at all.
[16-May-2015 23:13:13]  <Alicia> I forget what that was, rig.
[16-May-2015 23:13:21]  <Calica> to let everyone else take the lead
[16-May-2015 23:13:26]  *** Erio <~Christine@cpe-76-178-155-186.natnow.res.rr.com> has joined #madokamadness
[16-May-2015 23:13:27]  <Alicia> Oh, right.

[16-May-2015 23:13:45]  <Rig> No, to make IllFlower call Kazuki cold at least once every chapter of this arc.
[16-May-2015 23:13:59]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:9029:86d3:6d10:e516> has joined #madokamadness
[16-May-2015 23:14:01]  <IllFlower> Well, you can't do that if you don't make Kazuki do anything!
[16-May-2015 23:14:14]  <Rig> Kazuki drums his fingers against the table anxiously.
[16-May-2015 23:14:14]  <Calica> I think, behind Rig, I've probably taken the lead the second-most here, but Ayako probably has reason to be rather active and/or accuse Kataoka
[16-May-2015 23:15:16]  <Calica> The question is, how direct should Ayako be here?
[16-May-2015 23:15:31]  <Alicia> I forget how often Hikari's taken the lead, eheh. She could be taking the lead here, but Ayako - yeah what calica said.
[16-May-2015 23:15:31]  <Calica> Or should I just let Alicia and BGTB2005 take the lead, see how they do ;)
[16-May-2015 23:15:32]  <Rig> We set up this meeting because we think she's done something right?
[16-May-2015 23:15:37]  <Rig> What do we think she's done again?
[16-May-2015 23:15:39]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.13.173.216> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 202 seconds)
[16-May-2015 23:15:49]  <Alicia> to what degree*
[16-May-2015 23:15:56]  <IllFlower> While they're waiting, Rin gets a text from Chiaki. "Apparently there's been a suspicious middle-aged man hanging around school for the past few days. I don't know if this is related to anything, but I thought you should know."
[16-May-2015 23:15:59]  <Calica> We think she might be involved with something since she's getting into arguments with prospective initiate-san
[16-May-2015 23:16:11]  <Rig> Ah, right, and initiates were killed where she works.
[16-May-2015 23:16:31]  <Rig> Kazuki is hardly middle aged!
[16-May-2015 23:16:47]  <Calica> Rig: I was thinking his dad maybe but probably not
[16-May-2015 23:17:07]  <Alicia> Hikari could lead into Kazuki doing stuff, except I'm blanking on what we did in the past.
[16-May-2015 23:17:57]  <IllFlower> One assumes Rin communicates the content of the text to the rest of the group, in her peculiarly taciturn fashion.
[16-May-2015 23:18:10]  <Rig> Alicia: last session Kazuki argued with everyone about accusing his mom.
[16-May-2015 23:18:24]  <Rig> And then agreed to do this, but only if other people handled it.
[16-May-2015 23:18:28]  <Rig> He barely wants to be here.
[16-May-2015 23:18:47]  <Alicia> (Pulls up logs)
[16-May-2015 23:19:33]  <Rig> "A suspicious guy hanging around the school," Kazuki says, "and instead we're talking to my mother who doesn't even want to be involved in this world."
[16-May-2015 23:20:29]  <BGTB2005> Rin reads the text, then shows it to the other Conservators
[16-May-2015 23:20:54]  <Rig> "What are you planning on saying to her anyway, Hikari?"
[16-May-2015 23:21:03]  <Calica> "An ex-initiate getting really upset at a potential one just as two die isn't nothing, Kazuki.  Not to mention, as much as you complained about circumstantial evidence in this case, all we have on this man is that he's suspicious."
[16-May-2015 23:21:05]  <BGTB2005> "I think we should check this out after we're done here."
[16-May-2015 23:22:00]  <Alicia> (I forget what I wanted to say for this session, months back, bluh.)
[16-May-2015 23:22:07]  <Rig> (Oops)
[16-May-2015 23:22:11]  <Calica> Alicia: well, what do you want to say now?
[16-May-2015 23:22:38]  <BGTB2005> (I kinda just try and make things up as I go along :/)
[16-May-2015 23:23:01]  <Calica> (I have a vague idea of what I want to do, but usually not an explicit one)
[16-May-2015 23:23:11]  <Alicia> (How is Kataoki related to Chiaki related to the clusterfuck that is our investigative team again?)
[16-May-2015 23:23:44]  <Alicia> (Er, connected to the whole initiate attacking deal.)
[16-May-2015 23:24:30]  <Calica> They got into an unspecified argument
[16-May-2015 23:25:10]  <IllFlower> The bell on the front door rings, drawing the group's attention, as Kazuki's mother walks in.
[16-May-2015 23:25:22]  <Rig> Kazuki shrinks in his seat.
[16-May-2015 23:25:27]  <IllFlower> Her eyes go wide for a moment on seeing Kazuki, but she quickly tamps down whatever surprise she may have felt and makes for the Conservators' table.
[16-May-2015 23:27:55]  <Calica> Alicia's asking me to lead in PM, so...
[16-May-2015 23:27:57]  <IllFlower> "I hope I haven't kept you waiting," she says, in the tone of someone reciting practiced phrases from a book.
[16-May-2015 23:28:14]  <IllFlower> *, as she takes an empty seat next to Ayako.
[16-May-2015 23:28:39]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.13.173.216> has joined #madokamadness
[16-May-2015 23:29:03]  <Calica> "It was fine.  I'm Minakami, do you remember the Conservators?
[16-May-2015 23:29:59]  <IllFlower> "Yes," Kazuki's mother says tersely. "You said you needed to talk about Chiaki's situation?"
[16-May-2015 23:30:59]  <IllFlower> She doesn't seem to want to be here any more than her son does.
[16-May-2015 23:32:09]  <Calica> "Yes.  We've heard that you've been frequently getting into arguments with her.  First of all, is there a particular reason for this?"
[16-May-2015 23:32:31]  <Rig> Kazuki tries to appear disinterested in all of this as he stares out the window.
[16-May-2015 23:32:45]  <IllFlower> "Can I have an explanation for what's going on first?"
[16-May-2015 23:33:50]  *** Juan1 <~Juan_Carl@CPEbc4dfb91a083-CMbc4dfb91a080.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[16-May-2015 23:34:19]  <IllFlower> She seems oddly defensive for someone talking to a girl literally a third her age.
[16-May-2015 23:34:43]  <Calica> "I assume you're more than familiar with the two recenty killed initiates who were students at your school?"
[16-May-2015 23:35:45]  <IllFlower> "I wasn't aware they were initiates," Kazuki's mother says.
[16-May-2015 23:36:02]  <Calica> A hint of accusation seeps into Ayako's voice, poorly hidden by the rehearsed professionalism.
[16-May-2015 23:36:14]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.13.173.216> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 202 seconds)
[16-May-2015 23:36:15]  <IllFlower> "I suppose that would explain why you're calling me here."
[16-May-2015 23:36:47]  <IllFlower> Her eyes slide over to Kazuki as she says the word "you."
[16-May-2015 23:37:23]  <Calica> BGTB2005, Alicia: Have anything to say here?
[16-May-2015 23:37:30]  <Rig> Kazuki almost responds to the look as he meets her eyes briefly, but he can't bring himself to.
[16-May-2015 23:38:43]  <IllFlower> "I'm not sure what you think this has to do with Chiaki, though."
[16-May-2015 23:39:18]  <Alicia> (Yes, sec.)
[16-May-2015 23:41:01]  <Calica> (I'm waiting for Alicia now, since she's been quiet I think)
[16-May-2015 23:42:42]  <Alicia> "Well, us too." Hikari clasps her hands on the "us", drawing the attention to her and Ayako. "One of your students had us rather concerned. Chiaki, to be specific."
[16-May-2015 23:43:53]  <Alicia> "Not long after the initiates were attacked she came to us hoping to be a Conservator, spurred on by thoughts of revenge. We only saw fit to bring this matter up with you." Hikari ends, coolly as she can.
[16-May-2015 23:44:01]  <BGTB2005> Rin redirects her attention from her necklace to the conversation
[16-May-2015 23:44:27]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Should be "hoping to be an initiate," I assume.
[16-May-2015 23:44:46]  <Alicia> Yes, that is what I meant before I "corrected" it because I am out of it
[16-May-2015 23:45:43]  <IllFlower> "That's her decision to make.
[16-May-2015 23:46:14]  <IllFlower> "I'm sure you've... been informed of this already, but I'm no longer involved with the Order.
[16-May-2015 23:46:32]  <Calica> BGTB2005: I think it might make sense for you to ask about the suspicious dude at some point in this conversation
[16-May-2015 23:46:47]  <IllFlower> "I don't understand how the view of a civilian like myself would matter at all."
[16-May-2015 23:47:53]  <Rig> Kazuki feels halfway justified in his earlier objections.
[16-May-2015 23:48:04]  *** CentralAvenue <webchat@198.231.20.20> has quit IRC (Quit: be back later)
[16-May-2015 23:48:13]  *** Juan1 is now known as Juan
[16-May-2015 23:49:21]  <Calica> "You're aware of the Order, and several of its members have ended up under your secular power, only to die!"  Ayako stands up from her seat, subconsciously.  "Do you not care?"
[16-May-2015 23:49:35]  <Alicia> (I'm just thinking, she's hardly a true civilian if she has a history with the Order, and it's a bit off of her to try and be so dispassionate about this magic got in the way of her life.)
[16-May-2015 23:50:43]  <Alicia> Hikari puts a hand on Ayako's arm, motioning her down. "Ayako, you're drawing attention. Please."
[16-May-2015 23:50:59]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's mother snaps right back. "What the hell do you know about death?
[16-May-2015 23:51:29]  <IllFlower> "Of course I care! That's why I *left*! Don't you dare talk about my departure like you know what happened!"
[16-May-2015 23:51:37]  <Calica> Ayako nods, and returns to her seat, keeping her gaze fixed on Kazuki's mother, just as she enters her response.
[16-May-2015 23:51:48]  <Rig> Kazuki sits back. He doesn't remember his mother ever being like this.
[16-May-2015 23:53:18]  <IllFlower> She stares down at Ayako, who is a good ten centimeters shorter.
[16-May-2015 23:53:42]  <Rig> "I said there wasn't any point to asking her," Kazuki whispers to Ayako.
[16-May-2015 23:55:52]  <Calica> Ayako begins a response, but looks back to Hikari and to the windows of the cafe, and realizes she should probably calm down before she ends up starting a fight.  She turns back to Kazuki.
[16-May-2015 23:56:14]  <Alicia> "My apologies for the offense, Ms. Kataoka." Hikari begins, trying to keep tempers from flaring. "They are your students, and you're still... unfortunately connected, even if you are a 'civilian.' We were hoping that even if you were unwilling to share information that might help with the investigation, you may point us to someone else knowledgeable."
[16-May-2015 23:56:38]  <Alicia> (I thought I was typing something little then I wasn't, oops, ohwell.)
[16-May-2015 23:56:57]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's mother looks like she still has a few words to shout at Ayako, but ultimately relents.
[16-May-2015 23:58:41]  <IllFlower> "I only know what happens around the school. If it's about magic, I don't see how I'd know anything relevant that you don't already know."
[16-May-2015 23:59:02]  <Alicia> (Now might be a good time for that creepy dude, then.)
[16-May-2015 23:59:26]  <Calica> (agreed)
[17-May-2015 00:00:34]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[17-May-2015 00:02:52]  <Alicia> (Okay now just how to bring it up in a way that isn't shoehorning..)
[17-May-2015 00:02:52]  <Rig> Kazuki stands up to leave, "Sorry we bothered you."
[17-May-2015 00:05:08]  <IllFlower> Miss Kataoka stares at Kazuki, saying nothing.
[17-May-2015 00:05:33]  <Calica> I think Rin should probably just "Wait, I have one more question"
[17-May-2015 00:05:39]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[17-May-2015 00:05:41]  <Rig> Kazuki meets her stare for a moment. He takes a breath like he intends to say something, but just sighs.
[17-May-2015 00:06:03]  <Calica> so I'd say Rig should let BGTB2005 type, and BGTB2005 should just type as quickly as he can >_>
[17-May-2015 00:06:33]  <Rig> Sorry.
[17-May-2015 00:06:36]  <Rig> We can just move time around.
[17-May-2015 00:06:44]  <Calica> yeah
[17-May-2015 00:07:41]  <BGTB2005> Letting the pendant dangle, Rin speaks up. "If you don't mind, what was the argument with Chiaki about?"
[17-May-2015 00:08:11]  <Alicia> Hikari looks to Kazuki before looking back at Sumiko. "Ms. Kataoka, if you must, you can contact your son when he's off of duty. Otherwise, we will have to take our leave and continue with business."
[17-May-2015 00:08:19]  <Alicia> (Imagine that came before Rin.)
[17-May-2015 00:09:01]  <IllFlower> Wow, I didn't think you guys would hang on to that argument thing.
[17-May-2015 00:09:51]  <Calica> I thought bgt was going to talk about the dude that was mentioned in the text to her
[17-May-2015 00:09:56]  <IllFlower> Any answer I can give is going to be pretty much irrelevant.
[17-May-2015 00:10:19]  <BGTB2005> ...that was what you wanted Rin to ask about?
[17-May-2015 00:10:26]  <BGTB2005> oops
[17-May-2015 00:10:28]  <Alicia> (Yeh.)
[17-May-2015 00:10:57]  <Alicia> (Which is why I wasn't sure how to speak about it without sounding like I'm shoehorning stuff, because some creeper =/= magix.)
[17-May-2015 00:12:16]  <IllFlower> Well, she did say that she knows about things going on at the school.
[17-May-2015 00:12:19]  <BGTB2005> (I dunno, maybe the suspicious dude might be relevant in some way to the argument?)
[17-May-2015 00:12:41]  <Calica> (yeah i'd say you can probably just change it to be about the suspicious dude >_>)
[17-May-2015 00:13:30]  <Alicia> (IF: Point.)
[17-May-2015 00:16:11]  <Rig> What's going on now then?
[17-May-2015 00:16:40]  <IllFlower> I think we're getting a question about suspicious dude.
[17-May-2015 00:18:04]  <IllFlower> (*unsubtly clears throat* "I SAID I THINK WE'RE GETTING A QUESTION ABOUT SUSPICIOUS DUDE")
[17-May-2015 00:18:16]  <Calica> BGTB2005?
[17-May-2015 00:18:20]  <Alicia> "Ah, but before you go. Would you know anything about the man that has been loitering around your school, by any chance?"
[17-May-2015 00:18:44]  <Alicia> (If you want to act like I didn't say anything then sure, I just said what came to mind.)
[17-May-2015 00:19:32]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's mother looks back at Hikari.
[17-May-2015 00:20:12]  <IllFlower> "What? Oh." She stammers, trying to find a calmer voice.
[17-May-2015 00:20:45]  <Alicia> "Did I touch a nerve? My apologies if I did." Hikari smiles back pleasantly.
[17-May-2015 00:21:30]  <IllFlower> "We were told about that rumor at the last staff meeting, but nothing --"
[17-May-2015 00:21:45]  <IllFlower> She suddenly stops short, as if something's occurred to her.
[17-May-2015 00:21:48]  <Rig> Wow, and everyone thinks Kazuki is the jerk.
[17-May-2015 00:22:17]  <IllFlower> It's inherited jerkishness.
[17-May-2015 00:23:22]  <BGTB2005> I wonder which of Kazuki's parents is the bigger jerk?
[17-May-2015 00:23:25]  <IllFlower> In any case, she looks up again at Kazuki for a second, then down at the table, where a motley assortment of ordinarily hot drinks has gone rather cold.
[17-May-2015 00:23:50]  <Alicia> "Yes, Ms. Kataoka?"
[17-May-2015 00:24:09]  <BGTB2005> (is the strange man Kazuki's father?)
[17-May-2015 00:24:40]  <Calica> (that's my first guess but I don't expect it to be right)
[17-May-2015 00:25:37]  <Rig> That'd be really awkward.
[17-May-2015 00:25:49]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's mother shakes her head. "I just remembered something. Probably..." She sighs. "Probably not relevant."
[17-May-2015 00:25:53]  <BGTB2005> (I don't expect it to be right either, I just thought it might be funny)
[17-May-2015 00:28:10]  <IllFlower> Surely nobody's planning on letting her dodge the question like that!
[17-May-2015 00:28:42]  <Alicia> "How could the rumor be irrelevant? Rin, at least, has cause to be concerned for her friend there..."
[17-May-2015 00:29:55]  <IllFlower> "It happened years ago. Seven or eight by now."
[17-May-2015 00:30:48]  <IllFlower> Come to think of it, that was about when she left the Order, but only Kazuki would know.
[17-May-2015 00:31:24]  <Calica> "What happened years ago?"
[17-May-2015 00:32:16]  <IllFlower> "Like I said, it doesn't mean anything."
[17-May-2015 00:32:37]  <IllFlower> If you want to do a talking conflict, might as well do it now!
[17-May-2015 00:33:18]  <Rig> Hehehe.
[17-May-2015 00:34:25]  <IllFlower> Bueller?
[17-May-2015 00:34:26]  <BGTB2005> I have no idea what to do regarding what Rin would say, but I think she might (want to) be involved?
[17-May-2015 00:34:44]  <Calica> Yeah, I think a talking conflict would be good
[17-May-2015 00:34:49]  <Rig> I would be amused by the possibility of a talking conflict.
[17-May-2015 00:34:52]  <IllFlower> Well, the Conservators clearly want her to spill, and she clearly doesn't. So let's go.

[17-May-2015 00:37:47]  <IllFlower> Wait, how is Kazuki going to participate if he hasn't said a word yet?
[17-May-2015 00:38:07]  <Calica> IllFlower: we never said which side he's going to be on, as well
[17-May-2015 00:38:19]  <Calica> (of course, DitV conflicts are supposed to be pretty fluid as those go, I think)
[17-May-2015 00:38:20]  <IllFlower> He just wants to go home.
[17-May-2015 00:38:29]  <Rig> You can have a talking conflict with meaningful glances.
[17-May-2015 00:38:34]  <IllFlower> Uh-huh.
[17-May-2015 00:38:34]  <Calica> I can be it if Alicia doesn't want to be it.  Alicia?
[17-May-2015 00:38:41]  <Rig> I raise with a baleful stare. 6 6
[17-May-2015 00:38:59]  <IllFlower> Calica: Just be it. Ayako's the one prodding her.

[17-May-2015 00:50:05]  * IllFlower gives Alicia a light rap on the head
[17-May-2015 00:50:36]  <IllFlower> Just put up dice for now. Like we usually do.
[17-May-2015 00:50:44]  <Alicia> (Calica said something like I wanted to before I got to, heh. >_>)
[17-May-2015 00:51:05]  <IllFlower> Unless you actually have something you want to do as an independent reaction.
[17-May-2015 00:51:13]  <Calica> Alicia: heh, we can probably do this like previous talking comments, and you piggyback on my see and just put up dice?
[17-May-2015 00:51:35]  <IllFlower> That's what I said! :(
[17-May-2015 00:51:42]  <BGTB2005> I kinda want to have Rin mention her concerns about Chiaki and any sort of possible connection to the strange man, but I'm not sure if it would be suitable as a see or more like a raise
[17-May-2015 00:51:43]  <Alicia> @dice use 5 5

[17-May-2015 00:52:06]  <BGTB2005> or if I would get to use the die for that relationship
[17-May-2015 00:52:18]  <IllFlower> She's not directly at stake, so I would say no.
[17-May-2015 00:52:37]  <Alicia> (Really sorry, haha. I was just typing that up and then "that's what we're doing!" came up and I was all @_@.)

[17-May-2015 00:53:55]  <Calica> Does anyone other than Ayako have to see that
[17-May-2015 00:54:13]  <Rig> I don't think so.
[17-May-2015 00:54:30]  <IllFlower> Anyone who wants to stay, maybe?
[17-May-2015 00:54:31]  <Calica> also, dice-wise, does this count as bringing the Conservators in?  I forget how we decided on that last time
[17-May-2015 00:54:39]  <Rig> Yeah, unless they're really bent on staying.
[17-May-2015 00:54:46]  <Rig> I don't think so.
[17-May-2015 00:54:58]  <IllFlower> I think now you're technically opponents, so yes.
[17-May-2015 00:55:07]  <Rig> Okay then.
[17-May-2015 00:55:10]  <BGTB2005> Rin wants to stay
[17-May-2015 00:55:14]  <IllFlower> Wait, no, sorry, only if it's a Kazuki relationship.
[17-May-2015 00:55:48]  * BGTB2005 checks character sheet
[17-May-2015 00:56:44]  <IllFlower> So basically BGTB2005 gets 1d6 and that's it.
[17-May-2015 00:57:05]  <Rig> :D
[17-May-2015 00:57:13]  <Rig> Bow before the verbal might of Kazuki.
[17-May-2015 00:57:46]  <Calica> Right now I'm trying to think of a good way to take the blow, since my first thought is sort of a "She wanted out, but we're not trying to pull her back in, just get her to answer questions" which doesn't quite fit?  Or maybe it does
[17-May-2015 00:58:03]  <BGTB2005> @dice add d6 >! this good?

[17-May-2015 00:58:13]  <Rig> I think that's a workable response.
[17-May-2015 00:58:23]  <IllFlower> Or she's just frustrated.
[17-May-2015 00:58:31]  <BGTB2005> ...lotta good bumping that up to a d6 did there...
[17-May-2015 00:58:51]  <IllFlower> E.g. "We didn't come here to get nothing!"
[17-May-2015 00:59:57]  <Calica> "I...wait...I'm not trying to pull her back in, just trying to get information!"

[17-May-2015 01:01:00]  <IllFlower> I think Alicia and BGTB2005 need to see as well.
[17-May-2015 01:01:16]  <BGTB2005> yeah

[17-May-2015 01:02:27]  <Alicia> I need to see 10?
[17-May-2015 01:02:37]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[17-May-2015 01:02:49]  <IllFlower> I have a whiteboard now that's great for keeping track of these things without using lots of paper.

[17-May-2015 01:03:01]  <IllFlower> ("You have a computer." "Shut up.")
[17-May-2015 01:03:34]  <Alicia> Perhaps bring in Allies 1d6 because Ayako isn't exactly making things easy by acting up?

[17-May-2015 01:26:34]  <Calica> well if you changed that line to be something blunt
[17-May-2015 01:27:14]  <IllFlower> Rin is presumably trying to help a sister out. An onee-sama, if you will.
[17-May-2015 01:28:26]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[17-May-2015 01:30:05]  <BGTB2005> so roll the d6 for her non-violent aid trait?

[17-May-2015 01:37:09]  <BGTB2005> maybe if I had mentioned something about Chiaki essentially being Rin's big sister in her line, there would've been more to work with...

[17-May-2015 01:41:59]  <IllFlower> Take the reins.
[17-May-2015 01:42:03]  <IllFlower> You might want some more dice, though.
[17-May-2015 01:42:13]  <Calica> yeah, I'm thinking of adding 2d6 on Kazuki

[17-May-2015 01:45:51]  <IllFlower> Give Kazuki a talking-to for being so defensive about his mother.
[17-May-2015 01:46:01]  <IllFlower> Though you should have done that after deciding what Ayako would say. :p
[17-May-2015 01:46:52]  <Calica> "Your mother was about to present information, and then suddenly retracts, and you still don't find that suspicious?  Kazuki, I think your familial connections are getting in the way of your duties as a Conservator.  Please step aside and let me convince her to help us here."
[17-May-2015 01:46:58]  <Calica> IllFlower: well, I was pretty much going to say that anyways so

[17-May-2015 01:49:07]  <Calica> It was a little bit directed there.  At the very least, Ayako wasn't wanting her to not hear it.
[17-May-2015 01:49:59]  <Rig> "Ayako, I understand that you want to figure this out, but remember the last time you pushed someone for information." Kazuki hopes Ayako hasn't forgotten torching most of the upper floors of a hospital in order to stop a single person.

[17-May-2015 02:01:53]  <IllFlower> I can't see, so I'm going to give. You'll still have to talk down Kazuki, though.
[17-May-2015 02:02:26]  <BGTB2005> I think I still need to see?
[17-May-2015 02:02:27]  <Calica> did Kazuki already raise?  I think this is still the sam "round" where I started raising
[17-May-2015 02:02:40]  <Calica> BGTB2005: you can also give, or you can see and just piggyback on my line
[17-May-2015 02:03:31]  <IllFlower> No, Rig hasn't raised yet.
[17-May-2015 02:03:38]  <Rig> Is it my turn to raise?

[17-May-2015 02:05:55]  <IllFlower> No reason for BGTB2005 to take that fallout, so 3d4.

[17-May-2015 02:07:57]  <BGTB2005> and XP
[17-May-2015 02:08:04]  <Calica> Oh yeah, it odes.  One XP fallout for all of us.
[17-May-2015 02:09:07]  <IllFlower> Rig: I don't think the 2 is going to be relevant unless we have a follow-up, and it looks like we won't.
[17-May-2015 02:09:36]  <IllFlower> Anyway, we don't have all that much time left, so we'll handle the short-term fallout in a bit and do some more of that roleplaying thing.

[17-May-2015 02:10:31]  <Rig> True.
[17-May-2015 02:10:44]  <Rig> Kazuki turns away from the group, looking back out the window.
[17-May-2015 02:10:59]  <Calica> kazuki sulkura
[17-May-2015 02:11:05]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[17-May-2015 02:11:27]  <IllFlower> She sighs. "I should know better than to think I could escape the Conservators' questioning."
[17-May-2015 02:12:28]  <IllFlower> A moment passes, then: "One condition.
[17-May-2015 02:12:52]  <IllFlower> "Let me talk to Kazuki in private first."
[17-May-2015 02:13:34]  <Rig> Kazuki turns, surprised, to object, but falls silent. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing.
[17-May-2015 02:13:37]  <Calica> Ayako looks at the other Conservators, a bit wound up regarding Kazuki but leaning on the side of granting the request.
[17-May-2015 02:14:15]  <Alicia> Hikari looks to Kazuki, beseechingly. "Kazuki?"
[17-May-2015 02:14:36]  <Alicia> (beseech ~> wasn't sure how else to say like "politely asking" but w/o needing to, also I like the word)
[17-May-2015 02:14:37]  <Rig> "That's fine," he says.
[17-May-2015 02:14:50]  <Rig> Flatly.
[17-May-2015 02:15:02]  <Calica> "I'll accept."
[17-May-2015 02:17:59]  <Calica> IllFlower?
[17-May-2015 02:18:08]  <IllFlower> Oh, I didn't realize you were waiting for me to say something.
[17-May-2015 02:18:22]  <Calica> well, we're letting you talk to Kazuki in private first
[17-May-2015 02:18:34]  <Calica> Ayako and the others temporarily shuffle out of the cafe.
[17-May-2015 02:18:48]  <IllFlower> How much longer does everyone have?
[17-May-2015 02:19:04]  <IllFlower> Calica: I thought you wanted to be done by 7:00 and it's 7:19.
[17-May-2015 02:19:11]  <Calica> By 7:30 is fine
[17-May-2015 02:19:24]  <IllFlower> It'll be longer than that.
[17-May-2015 02:19:30]  <IllFlower> Especially given IRC time dilation.
[17-May-2015 02:19:32]  <Calica> true
[17-May-2015 02:19:38]  <Calica> Uh, what does everyone else think?
[17-May-2015 02:19:51]  <Rig> If you need to go we can stop.
[17-May-2015 02:20:01]  <IllFlower> I figure we should wrap and maybe shove some fallout decisions into the remaining time.
[17-May-2015 02:20:02]  <Rig> We should probably start earlier in the day next time.
[17-May-2015 02:20:28]  <IllFlower> Yeah, I messed that up. Creatures of habit, you know.
[17-May-2015 02:20:42]  <Rig> It's okay. It was fun, just kinda late.
[17-May-2015 02:21:11]  <IllFlower> ANYWAY PEOPLE WITH FALLOUT TO HANDLE CAN WE HANDLE THAT
[17-May-2015 02:21:24]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[17-May-2015 02:21:29]  <Calica> sure
[17-May-2015 02:21:44]  <Calica> let's see, the fallout all came on the response to "she's out, don't drag her back in"
[17-May-2015 02:22:36]  <Alicia> Sorry about my slow start.
[17-May-2015 02:22:40]  <BGTB2005> for my short term I was thinking d6 -> d4 Kazuki?
[17-May-2015 02:23:01]  <IllFlower> Sure.
[17-May-2015 02:23:02]  <Rig> I think that would work.
[17-May-2015 02:23:54]  <Calica> I'm thinking something like "Pushy", either as a temporary d4 or a d6 with the XP and then temporarily put to d4
[17-May-2015 02:25:23]  <Alicia> Hrm.
[17-May-2015 02:25:25]  <BGTB2005> I'm not sure what to do with my XP though
[17-May-2015 02:26:06]  <IllFlower> Calica: Something more specific than "pushy" might be good but I like the general idea.
[17-May-2015 02:26:08]  <Calica> I don't like the phrasing of "Pushy" but something along those lines, very much not backing down?  (which is close but not quite not running from violence)
[17-May-2015 02:26:26]  <IllFlower> Although I think "takes charge" is already halfway there.
[17-May-2015 02:26:34]  <Calica> hmm, true
[17-May-2015 02:26:58]  <Calica> I could add a die/increase with the XP and then temporary d4, lol
[17-May-2015 02:27:21]  <Calica> or add a die/increase with the XP and something about being blinkered magically for the temporary?
[17-May-2015 02:28:55]  <Alicia> Perhaps up Allies and temporarily lower Ht?
[17-May-2015 02:29:21]  <IllFlower> Calica: I think an effect on the relationship with Kazuki would be the most logical.
[17-May-2015 02:29:37]  <Calica> IllFlower: For the latter?
[17-May-2015 02:29:39]  <IllFlower> Ayako won on taking charge so a bump for XP may be in order.
[17-May-2015 02:29:42]  <Calica> er, the temporary fallout?
[17-May-2015 02:29:49]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[17-May-2015 02:30:11]  <Calica> so do I insert a note as "originally 2d6" and replace it with 2d4?
[17-May-2015 02:30:59]  <Rig> That works
[17-May-2015 02:31:07]  <Calica> bumped up die size and temporarily reduced die size.
[17-May-2015 02:31:10]  <Calica> Thanks for hosting us, IllFlower 
[17-May-2015 02:31:15]  <BGTB2005> Rin's motivation was her concern for Chiaki, so maybe I could do something with that?
[17-May-2015 02:32:21]  <IllFlower> Calica: Yeah.
[17-May-2015 02:32:46]  <Alicia> IllFlower: I'm thinking of upping the die on Allies since Hikari was rather involved in the others (from 1d6 to whatever d6 it is), then knocking Ht temporarily since I'm not sure what else
[17-May-2015 02:32:53]  <Rig> BGTB2005: Maybe a boost to Can help people w/o violence.
[17-May-2015 02:33:05]  <Rig> Or standing up for others.
[17-May-2015 02:33:19]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Okay.
[17-May-2015 02:34:07]  <Rig> Thanks for hosting IllFlower. Sorry that it's been so long.
[17-May-2015 02:34:23]  <IllFlower> Of course. Thanks for playing.
[17-May-2015 02:34:26]  <Alicia> Still "recoiling", albeit in weaker and weaker ways, about Hikari not turning out how I envisioned, even if I like her now.

[17-May-2015 02:35:05]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: "Stands up for others" -> d8 probably.
[17-May-2015 02:35:32]  <IllFlower> I should mention, there's a difference between comments and notes on the sheet. We use the latter.
[17-May-2015 02:35:50]  <IllFlower> The former opens up a discussion thread and that gets annoying since you can't edit other people's comments.
[17-May-2015 02:36:25]  <Alicia> Wait, I thought we always used notes. Did someone mistype something
[17-May-2015 02:36:49]  <IllFlower> I converted a few.
[17-May-2015 02:37:03]  <IllFlower> Just a reminder.
[17-May-2015 02:37:28]  <Alicia> Okay.
[17-May-2015 02:37:44]  <Alicia> I was/am enjoying this, at least~
[17-May-2015 02:38:36]  <IllFlower> I don't think I'll be able to run a session next weekend, unless people are free on Memorial Day, but we can go full steam ahead the weekend after that.
[17-May-2015 02:38:38]  <BGTB2005> yeah I guess I'll go with Stands up for others d6 -> d8 for XP
[17-May-2015 02:38:48]  <IllFlower> And done.
[17-May-2015 02:39:00]  <BGTB2005> I might be free that weekend; I'll have to check
[17-May-2015 02:39:06]  <IllFlower> Thanks again, everyone. We'll do this again soon. Let me know if Memorial Day does actually work for you.
