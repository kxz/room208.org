@time=2015-05-16T23:05:06.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: You should wait until we start to have that.
@time=2015-05-16T23:05:13.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Endless, whatevs.
@time=2015-05-16T23:05:17.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: Good point.
@time=2015-05-16T23:05:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, when we left our heroes, they were on their way to visit a certain Kazuki's mother.
@time=2015-05-16T23:05:48.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Are there many other Kazukis?
@time=2015-05-16T23:06:01.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Infinite Kazuki Works.
@time=2015-05-16T23:06:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How do we want to play this?
@time=2015-05-16T23:06:16.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: IIRC it's a rather common name in Japan and that's why IllFlower chose it
@time=2015-05-16T23:06:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think Kazuki said that other people had to take the lead on this.
@time=2015-05-16T23:06:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The initiates could make a house call, meet in a cafe, become death, destroyer of worlds...
@time=2015-05-16T23:07:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The last one sounds good.
@time=2015-05-16T23:07:05.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I sort of think either calling her into neutral territory like a cafe or cornering her at school would make the most sense
@time=2015-05-16T23:07:19.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :cafe sounds good?
@time=2015-05-16T23:07:23.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let's bring the enemy into more helpful grounds like the cafe.
@time=2015-05-16T23:07:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Helpful grounds? Cafe?
@time=2015-05-16T23:07:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Coffee grounds?
@time=2015-05-16T23:07:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Insofar as it's not "enemy territory"
@time=2015-05-16T23:07:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Puns.
@time=2015-05-16T23:08:02.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, cafe seems to be the vote.
@time=2015-05-16T23:08:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ACTION throws a set of cymbals down the stairs
@time=2015-05-16T23:08:13.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh. Heh. I rule.
@time=2015-05-16T23:08:34.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :though wasn't Kazuki's mom going to visit Chiaki?
@time=2015-05-16T23:08:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Because that'd be a good place to have an awkward reunion, Chiaki's house.
@time=2015-05-16T23:09:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The initiates call Kazuki's mother and ask her to a cafe. She's understandably confused given the lack of detail in their request, but ultimately accepts.
@time=2015-05-16T23:10:32.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :They gave no names, as usual.
@time=2015-05-16T23:11:38.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :our next game should have magic put a big emphasis on True Name stuff so that this will either stop being brought up or be brought up even more
@time=2015-05-16T23:12:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The winter night's already gotten underway by the time the initiates get to the small coffee shop by the school. They're all a bit early, at Hikari's insistence, so Miss Kataoka's not arrived yet.
@time=2015-05-16T23:12:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :This would be the perfect time for Kazuki to figure out how he's going to act.
@time=2015-05-16T23:12:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, my personal challenge still stands.
@time=2015-05-16T23:13:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or to pretend like nothing's bothering him at all.

@time=2015-05-16T23:14:14.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki drums his fingers against the table anxiously.
@time=2015-05-16T23:14:14.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think, behind Rig, I've probably taken the lead the second-most here, but Ayako probably has reason to be rather active and/or accuse Kataoka
@time=2015-05-16T23:15:16.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The question is, how direct should Ayako be here?
@time=2015-05-16T23:15:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I forget how often Hikari's taken the lead, eheh. She could be taking the lead here, but Ayako - yeah what calica said.

@time=2015-05-16T23:15:59.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We think she might be involved with something since she's getting into arguments with prospective initiate-san
@time=2015-05-16T23:16:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ah, right, and initiates were killed where she works.
@time=2015-05-16T23:16:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki is hardly middle aged!
@time=2015-05-16T23:16:47.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: I was thinking his dad maybe but probably not
@time=2015-05-16T23:17:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari could lead into Kazuki doing stuff, except I'm blanking on what we did in the past.

@time=2015-05-17T02:23:54.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm thinking something like "Pushy", either as a temporary d4 or a d6 with the XP and then temporarily put to d4

@time=2015-05-17T02:26:58.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I could add a die/increase with the XP and then temporary d4, lol
@time=2015-05-17T02:27:21.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :or add a die/increase with the XP and something about being blinkered magically for the temporary?
@time=2015-05-17T02:28:55.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Perhaps up Allies and temporarily lower Ht?
@time=2015-05-17T02:29:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Calica: I think an effect on the relationship with Kazuki would be the most logical.
