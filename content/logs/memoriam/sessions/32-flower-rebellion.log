[16-Aug-2014 20:20:14]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: ✨ | UA (IDEOGRAMMATIC): Oneshot soon - see wiki for details
[16-Aug-2014 20:21:25]  <IllFlower> We left off last time with Pyunpyun reporting that a good six of his initiates would be retiring en masse, presumably in protest.
[16-Aug-2014 20:21:57]  *** MobileAvenue <~CentralAv@d60-65-209-130.col.wideopenwest.com> has joined #madokamadness
[16-Aug-2014 20:22:38]  <IllFlower> We didn't have much time for reactions, so if you guys would like to do those now, feel free.
[16-Aug-2014 20:22:54]  <IllFlower> Otherwise, I'm all ears as to what you'd like to do next.
[16-Aug-2014 20:24:17]  <Rig> I think I’m good on the reaction front.
[16-Aug-2014 20:24:50]  <ponicalica> I think I'm good too.
[16-Aug-2014 20:24:53]  <BGTB2005> same here
[16-Aug-2014 20:24:57]  <ponicalica> Alicia?
[16-Aug-2014 20:25:06]  <Alicia> Same. Hikari would want to check the Conservator Boards or whatever to see if any people need apprehending.
[16-Aug-2014 20:25:20]  <Alicia> Or, whatever we get assigned, alternatively.
[16-Aug-2014 20:25:55]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[16-Aug-2014 20:27:40]  <IllFlower> Mollified for the time being, the Conservators retire for the night. The next day seems to be business as usual, until Shii summons the Conservators to her base again the next day.
[16-Aug-2014 20:27:51]  <ponicalica> duh duh duh
[16-Aug-2014 20:28:19]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun is there as well. It doesn't take much to put two and two together.
[16-Aug-2014 20:29:54]  <IllFlower> "We have a problem," Shii says, trying not to sound too embarrassingly dramatic.
[16-Aug-2014 20:31:32]  <Rig> Unsurprising.
[16-Aug-2014 20:32:03]  <IllFlower> "A few of the initiates who were supposed to resign this morning didn't show up for the ritual this morning. Their whereabouts are unknown at the moment."
[16-Aug-2014 20:32:17]  <IllFlower> s/this morning //
[16-Aug-2014 20:33:07]  <ponicalica> "So they lied to their familiar."  Ayako looks at Kazuki.  "Do we have any idea where they may be?"
[16-Aug-2014 20:35:15]  <IllFlower> "I can't think of anyth--" Pyunpyun starts, before he's interrupted by the door opening.
[16-Aug-2014 20:35:16]  <Alicia> "Do we know how many are left, and who didn't resign?"
[16-Aug-2014 20:35:50]  <IllFlower> Narumi steps through the threshold, back in her familiar school uniform.
[16-Aug-2014 20:35:56]  *** MobileAvenue <~CentralAv@d60-65-209-130.col.wideopenwest.com> has quit IRC (Quit: MobileAvenue)
[16-Aug-2014 20:36:37]  <IllFlower> "Sorry I'm late," she says. "This place is a bit of a labyrinth..."
[16-Aug-2014 20:38:26]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun looks somewhat puzzled.
[16-Aug-2014 20:38:28]  <IllFlower> "I had someone call her here," Shii explains.
[16-Aug-2014 20:39:32]  <IllFlower> "One of the Conservators called me here," Narumi unintentionally echoes. "What's happened?"
[16-Aug-2014 20:39:55]  <Alicia> Hikari looks at Rin.
[16-Aug-2014 20:41:02]  <ponicalica> "We were told that you had lost your faith in the Order and resigned.  Or is that another lie?"
[16-Aug-2014 20:42:18]  <IllFlower> Narumi makes a face. "Pyunpyun revoked my powers this morning."
[16-Aug-2014 20:42:45]  <IllFlower> Pyunpyun, for his part, just nods at Ayako.
[16-Aug-2014 20:48:37]  <Rig> Sorry, trying to figure out my financials for the school year. Now I’m actually here and hopefully not having a panic attack.
[16-Aug-2014 20:49:03]  <Alicia> "Hello there." Hikari nods in her direction before turning to Pyunpyun and Shii. "In any case, I'm assuming you called all of us in here for something, so just what is it?"
[16-Aug-2014 20:49:13]  <Alicia> (I hope that works itself out well, Rig.)
[16-Aug-2014 20:50:07]  <IllFlower> Shii tries to pick up with her explanation.
[16-Aug-2014 20:50:22]  <IllFlower> "As you can see, Narumi showed up this morning as promised.
[16-Aug-2014 20:50:32]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@203.153.200.54> has joined #madokamadness
[16-Aug-2014 20:51:11]  <IllFlower> "Two other initiates also went through with the ceremony: Aoyama and Tsukino...
[16-Aug-2014 20:51:24]  <ponicalica> i recognize those names
[16-Aug-2014 20:52:50]  <IllFlower> "The remaining three, the ones presumably at large, are Youichi Nagatsuka, Miu Kanda, and Ritsuko Yonezawa."
[16-Aug-2014 20:54:00]  <Rig> Kazuki nods. He sort of expected something like this after hearing the news last night.
[16-Aug-2014 20:54:13]  <Alicia> So the dude and the girl and a new girl.
[16-Aug-2014 20:54:17]  <Alicia> Fun.
[16-Aug-2014 20:54:28]  <ponicalica> Alicia: exactly Pyunpyun's initiates in the conflict
[16-Aug-2014 20:54:40]  <Rig> “Narumi, do you have any idea where they might be?”
[16-Aug-2014 20:54:59]  <IllFlower> Narumi tilts her head in confusion. "Who?"
[16-Aug-2014 20:55:01]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Oh wait, yeah, I misread Miu in the chart. All of'em.
[16-Aug-2014 20:56:02]  <IllFlower> (I should remind everyone that Narumi can't see or hear the familiars now that she's depowered.)
[16-Aug-2014 20:56:12]  <IllFlower> (You can use this opportunity to lie hard, but that's up to you.)
[16-Aug-2014 20:56:23]  <Alicia> Why botther lying.
[16-Aug-2014 20:56:26]  <Alicia> bot*
[16-Aug-2014 20:56:46]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@203.153.200.54> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[16-Aug-2014 20:57:09]  <ponicalica> Alicia: because Kazuki is a compulsive liar
[16-Aug-2014 20:57:29]  <Alicia> I thought he only lied when - ... well, yeah, true. So far at least.
[16-Aug-2014 20:58:16]  <Rig> “Some of your former group members have gone missing,” Kazuki says to Narumi.
[16-Aug-2014 20:58:25]  <Rig> He rattles off the names. “Do you know where they might be?
[16-Aug-2014 20:58:26]  <Rig> "
[16-Aug-2014 20:59:21]  <IllFlower> "They didn't go through with the ritual after all...?" Narumi says, mostly to herself.
[16-Aug-2014 20:59:53]  <IllFlower> She stares down at the ground for a second, then answers.
[16-Aug-2014 21:01:12]  <IllFlower> "I don't know. I suspect you and the girl over there might have some ideas, though." Narumi points a finger straight at Rin. "I know when someone's trying to pull the strings."
[16-Aug-2014 21:01:37]  <ponicalica> pfffff
[16-Aug-2014 21:01:57]  <BGTB2005> "...You told them?"
[16-Aug-2014 21:02:05]  <Rig> “Told them what?”
[16-Aug-2014 21:02:22]  <Alicia> "Rin, please, what happened with you and the other initiates?"
[16-Aug-2014 21:04:27]  <BGTB2005> "You were there, you should know."
[16-Aug-2014 21:06:11]  <ponicalica> Ayako stares at Rin and Kazuki.  "What the hell are you two doing without telling me or Hikari?"
[16-Aug-2014 21:06:24]  <BGTB2005> "But after you left, I went looking for somewhere Narumi could hold a private ceremony, and then I learned Sakura never had any intention of letting her go through with it."
[16-Aug-2014 21:06:29]  <Rig> The best part is that I’m actually confused.
[16-Aug-2014 21:07:42]  <ponicalica> and IllFlower was expecting this to be simple
[16-Aug-2014 21:08:29]  <IllFlower> Until I figured out a way to make it complicated!
[16-Aug-2014 21:08:39]  <IllFlower> Right, so who's confused about what?
[16-Aug-2014 21:08:55]  <Rig> Did Rin actualy do something subterfugerous?
[16-Aug-2014 21:09:09]  <ponicalica> She went behind everyone's back and talked to Narumi about a ceremony.
[16-Aug-2014 21:09:19]  <ponicalica> Presumably she thought she was doing it with the other conservators' blessing
[16-Aug-2014 21:09:24]  <ponicalica> except maybe Ayako's
[16-Aug-2014 21:09:29]  <BGTB2005> she thought she had the backing of the -- yeah
[16-Aug-2014 21:09:40]  <Rig> Kazuki sighs, “No one knows where the three rogue initiaties are. Rin… did you tell them about the location you found?”
[16-Aug-2014 21:09:52]  <IllFlower> You guys have made Narumi a wee bit paranoid, in case that wasn't obvious.
[16-Aug-2014 21:09:57]  <BGTB2005> "No, I only told Narumi."
[16-Aug-2014 21:10:43]  <Rig> “And Narumi told them?” Kazuki looks to her.
[16-Aug-2014 21:11:56]  <IllFlower> "I doubt I was the first," Narumi answers.
[16-Aug-2014 21:12:48]  <IllFlower> "But I was trying to sort everything out with Ritsuko last night, and we talked about it for a while. So, if you want the technically accurate answer, yes."
[16-Aug-2014 21:15:20]  <Rig> Kazuki nods. “Okay, I see. Thank you.” He tries to keep his cool and not let this get out of hand again.
[16-Aug-2014 21:15:38]  <Rig> He turns to the girls. “Can we agree that these rogue initiates are a problem?"
[16-Aug-2014 21:16:30]  <ponicalica> "Definitely.  At this point, they've flat-out rejected the authority of their familiar."
[16-Aug-2014 21:17:18]  <Alicia> "Of course."
[16-Aug-2014 21:18:14]  <ponicalica> "Rin?"  Ayako stares.
[16-Aug-2014 21:18:19]  <Rig> Kazuki looks at Rin.
[16-Aug-2014 21:18:25]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@203.153.200.54> has joined #madokamadness
[16-Aug-2014 21:19:29]  <BGTB2005> Rin glares back at Kazuki. "Yeah, whatever."
[16-Aug-2014 21:19:37]  <Alicia> Hikari starts off towards the door. "Whether she agrees or not isn't the issue. What we need to do is find them, quickly."
[16-Aug-2014 21:19:46]  <Alicia> (Act like that came before Rin. :v)
[16-Aug-2014 21:20:16]  <Rig> “Let’s check the location Rin scouted out first.”
[16-Aug-2014 21:20:29]  <Rig> “Lead the way?” he asks Rin.
[16-Aug-2014 21:25:27]  <Alicia> (ping)
[16-Aug-2014 21:25:35]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: ping
[16-Aug-2014 21:26:32]  <IllFlower> Rin, after spending some more time glaring at Kazuki, heads out of the door, not really bothering to check if the other three are following her. She keeps her head low as she passes Narumi on her way out.
[16-Aug-2014 21:26:57]  <ponicalica> Ayako leaves following after Rin, not saying much except a few whispers to Hikari.
[16-Aug-2014 21:28:26]  <Rig> Kazuki pauses before following the girls. “Narumi, I’m sorry that this happened. I… I am sorry.” He steps out of the room quickly to follow the girls.
[16-Aug-2014 21:29:02]  <ponicalica> sorry won't bring back my goddamn honey
[16-Aug-2014 21:30:19]  <IllFlower> Narumi says nothing, simply watching the Conservators trail down the hallway and out of sight.
[16-Aug-2014 21:30:43]  <BGTB2005> back, had to take care of something
[16-Aug-2014 21:31:00]  <BGTB2005> also couldn't really figure out anything to add
[16-Aug-2014 21:31:04]  <Alicia> "Ayako, I think it'd be a good idea if you tracked Rin while we follow. Make sure she isn't trying to trick us." She whispers, as Kazuki approaches. "What took you?" Her tone is jocular, though a bit needly.
[16-Aug-2014 21:31:40]  <ponicalica> "Tracked her?  There's really not much we can do except hope she doesn't turn on us again, really."
[16-Aug-2014 21:32:03]  <Rig> “This went really wrong. Narumi… probably wasn’t right for the Order, but leaving on these terms isn’t what I wanted.”
[16-Aug-2014 21:32:47]  <IllFlower> Is Kazuki trying to get Narumi to get back together with him or what?
[16-Aug-2014 21:33:26]  <IllFlower> "Please, babe, I didn't mean those terrible things I said. You know me, come on, please..."
[16-Aug-2014 21:33:59]  <IllFlower> Anyway - the location Rin gives is out in the suburbs, tucked away inside a tangle of alleys some distance from the neighborhood train station. Rin was right about one thing - it seems like nobody would find this place unless they were directed to it, and those directions would be pretty long.
[16-Aug-2014 21:34:08]  <Alicia> With a sigh, she gives up the idea. Guess being prepared is the only thing they can do.
[16-Aug-2014 21:34:40]  <Alicia> could*
[16-Aug-2014 21:36:27]  *** WildSeraph <~Spheraph@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has joined #madokamadness
[16-Aug-2014 21:36:31]  <IllFlower> Finally, the Conservators come upon a small paved courtyard, hemmed in on all sides by buildings that open only briefly to provide a single way in and out.
[16-Aug-2014 21:39:46]  <IllFlower> At the center of the otherwise deserted concrete square, darkened by afternoon shadows, is a small basket of white flowers with a card sticking out in the middle. It reads, in black felt-tip pen, "Hatsue Tsuruoka 1993-2013."
[16-Aug-2014 21:41:07]  <Rig> Kazuki eyes the flowers before scanning around the edges of the courtyard.
[16-Aug-2014 21:41:21]  <ponicalica> these flowers are an affront to the order
[16-Aug-2014 21:42:07]  <Alicia> Hikari is offended.
[16-Aug-2014 21:43:39]  <ponicalica> Ayako puts a hand out slightly toward the basket of flowers, seeking the magical signs of an illegal ceremony.
[16-Aug-2014 21:44:58]  <IllFlower> The basket emits a faint silver glow as Ayako performs her divination.
[16-Aug-2014 21:45:34]  <IllFlower> "This hasn't been here for long," she says. "Maybe fifteen minutes at most."
[16-Aug-2014 21:47:37]  <Rig> “Any signs of where they might have gone?” Kazuki asks as he approaches the basket.
[16-Aug-2014 21:48:11]  <IllFlower> Too bad the one who can play aerial spotter is the unenthusiastic one.
[16-Aug-2014 21:48:33]  <Alicia> And is angry with us, probably.
[16-Aug-2014 21:48:43]  <BGTB2005> mostly at Kazuki
[16-Aug-2014 21:49:04]  <Rig> Kazuki plucks the card from the basket and sends a pulse of magical power through it, burning it to ash instantly.
[16-Aug-2014 21:49:36]  <Rig> The action doesn’t fix the problem, he knows, but he feels like something had to be done.
[16-Aug-2014 21:49:47]  <IllFlower> Actually, well -
[16-Aug-2014 21:50:41]  <IllFlower> Still under the pull of Ayako's magic, the ashes collapse in the distinctly unnatural shape of an arrowhead, pointing to what Kazuki reckons by the sun is somwhere northeast.
[16-Aug-2014 21:51:24]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[16-Aug-2014 21:51:41]  <Rig> Jinkies, a clue.
[16-Aug-2014 21:52:07]  <Alicia> I like how you apologize to Narumi, then harm her little memorial.
[16-Aug-2014 21:52:21]  <Rig> It’s not a memorial to Narumi.
[16-Aug-2014 21:52:32]  <ponicalica> It's her sister's.
[16-Aug-2014 21:52:41]  <ponicalica> But yeah, Kazuki is incredibly two-faced.
[16-Aug-2014 21:52:45]  <BGTB2005> I'm doubting Narumi got to set it up
[16-Aug-2014 21:52:45]  <Rig> And it’s something that wasn’t allowed.
[16-Aug-2014 21:52:52]  <Alicia> Well no, but I mean that's still rude given how she feels about her sister.
[16-Aug-2014 21:53:11]  <Rig> I suppose it’d be rude if she was involved in it.
[16-Aug-2014 21:53:27]  <BGTB2005> It was still a memorial to her sister
[16-Aug-2014 21:53:43]  <IllFlower> I doubt Narumi put it there, unless she somehow managed to get ahead of the Conservators.
[16-Aug-2014 21:53:44]  <ponicalica> it was an illegal memorial to a sorceror
[16-Aug-2014 21:53:57]  <Alicia> With Kazuki's two-facedness in mind, off to the clue?
[16-Aug-2014 21:54:00]  <ponicalica> "I suppose we should follow the arrow."
[16-Aug-2014 21:54:21]  <Alicia> "It's not like we have any other options."
[16-Aug-2014 21:54:33]  <Rig> “It’s the best trace we seem to have."
[16-Aug-2014 21:55:19]  <IllFlower> Following the arrow is harder than it sounds, given that it points in a direction completely at odds with the arrangement of the local streets, but with the aid of their phone navigation they manage to make do.
[16-Aug-2014 21:55:40]  <BGTB2005> Rin has her wings, though...
[16-Aug-2014 21:55:55]  <IllFlower> Can you carry three people with those wings?
[16-Aug-2014 21:56:00]  <BGTB2005> no
[16-Aug-2014 21:56:13]  <BGTB2005> maybe she can glide, depending on how heavy they are
[16-Aug-2014 21:56:16]  <Rig> She’d just drop Kazuki anyway.
[16-Aug-2014 21:57:00]  <Alicia> So shipping Kazuki/Rin for the record.
[16-Aug-2014 21:57:32]  <IllFlower> Finally, about a kilometer away, they spot a few familiar faces inside a family restaurant.
[16-Aug-2014 21:57:52]  <Rig> Good. A place for Rin to blow up.
[16-Aug-2014 21:57:58]  <ponicalica> next in the list of things for Rin to yeah
[16-Aug-2014 21:58:18]  <Alicia> Oh no.
[16-Aug-2014 21:58:21]  <IllFlower> Youichi and company don't seem to care as much for secrecy as some of the Conservators' last targets. Or maybe they know it's harder to pull off crazy magic in public places.
[16-Aug-2014 21:58:38]  <ponicalica> >implying Rin would care
[16-Aug-2014 21:58:52]  * BGTB2005 adds 'Family Restaurant' under 'Kazuki' to Rin's List of Things to Blow up
[16-Aug-2014 21:59:09]  <ponicalica> is Ayako no longer on the list? :(
[16-Aug-2014 21:59:23]  <IllFlower> The three of them are huddled in a booth, talking to (or perhaps at) each other with incredible fervence.
[16-Aug-2014 21:59:47]  <Rig> Kazuki watches from a distance. “How should we handle this?”
[16-Aug-2014 21:59:52]  <BGTB2005> I don't think she was ever really on that list
[16-Aug-2014 22:00:11]  <ponicalica> oh right, she just got between her and ab ully once
[16-Aug-2014 22:01:56]  <Alicia> "They're already familiar with us, so simply staying around in there isn't an option. We could wait for them to come out, or try to force them out."
[16-Aug-2014 22:02:18]  <Alicia> After a few moments of considering what force would really mean to this group, Hikari adds "I think we should wait."
[16-Aug-2014 22:02:40]  <ponicalica> another stakeout?
[16-Aug-2014 22:03:04]  <Rig> “We could just walk in and talk to them. I mean, they know what they did was illegal. Maybe they’ll just surrender now and we can take them back to Pyunpyun to be stripped from the Order?"
[16-Aug-2014 22:03:19]  <Alicia> Well, what else? Maybe you could magically set off the fire alarm or something , but - true. Hm.
[16-Aug-2014 22:03:39]  <ponicalica> have Rin just send a burst of fire at the sprinkler, that could work
[16-Aug-2014 22:03:47]  <ponicalica> ("look at this weird footage from the security camera")
[16-Aug-2014 22:03:54]  <Alicia> "They've already gone rogue, and attempted to hold an illegal ceremony. As much as I would like it, do you honestly think they'd come in peacefully?"
[16-Aug-2014 22:04:31]  <Alicia> ponicalica: And she ends up causing an actual fire by accident? ;p
[16-Aug-2014 22:04:33]  <ponicalica> "I agree with Hikari.  They're not likely to come out without a fight.  But they're protecting themselves with the civilians at this restaurant."
[16-Aug-2014 22:04:37]  <ponicalica> Alicia: "accident"
[16-Aug-2014 22:04:55]  <IllFlower> It's just a basket of flowers, you know. I don't think that quite qualifies as a ceremony.
[16-Aug-2014 22:05:09]  <IllFlower> The anniversary of Hatsue's death is still a couple of days away.
[16-Aug-2014 22:05:16]  <Alicia> It's the thought that counts.
[16-Aug-2014 22:05:27]  <Alicia> True, though.
[16-Aug-2014 22:05:49]  <IllFlower> Well, that and the fact that a basket of flowers isn't against the rules. I think.
[16-Aug-2014 22:06:07]  <IllFlower> Sometimes it doesn't matter what the rules are when you're enforcing them.
[16-Aug-2014 22:06:17]  <Alicia> Okay. They were planning on it and we know they've got a rebellious streak in them.
[16-Aug-2014 22:06:19]  <Rig> “How about I go in and talk to them and you guys wait out here?"
[16-Aug-2014 22:06:34]  <ponicalica> "Are you sure you don't want backup?"
[16-Aug-2014 22:06:37]  <BGTB2005> "I could try asking them, since they aren't mad at me."
[16-Aug-2014 22:07:14]  <Alicia> The smooth talker or someone that didn't irk them, hm.
[16-Aug-2014 22:07:46]  <ponicalica> "I mean, if they do decide to magically attack, and we're separated..." Ayako thinks back to Jun.
[16-Aug-2014 22:08:32]  <IllFlower> They're in a restaurant. You do know not everyone has Rin's cavalier disregard for life and property.
[16-Aug-2014 22:09:34]  <Alicia> "Perhaps we could have Rin talk for us, while we move in close enough to respond if necessary. Although I doubt they'd freely risk so many lives, unless they really have dared to rebel..."
[16-Aug-2014 22:09:35]  <Rig> “Actually, maybe I should sit this out. They are probably pissed at me. Ayako and Rin could handle this?”
[16-Aug-2014 22:10:04]  <Rig> “Ayako has been here the longest, and Rin is certainly the most sympathetic to them.”
[16-Aug-2014 22:10:25]  <Rig> “Hikari and I will stay out here and out of sight in case they run for it."
[16-Aug-2014 22:10:54]  <Alicia> Hikari nods. "There's still no issue in staying close, provided we stay out of sight, though."
[16-Aug-2014 22:12:29]  <ponicalica> "I'm still not sure about splitting the party, but I suppose this makes sense." Ayako nods.
[16-Aug-2014 22:12:31]  <IllFlower> I've got about 45 minutes, so let's get this rolling.
[16-Aug-2014 22:13:25]  <Alicia> Hikari smiles to Ayako. "If they pull anything, we will respond."
[16-Aug-2014 22:13:54]  <ponicalica> Ayako and Rin, still uneasy with each other, walk up to the group.
[16-Aug-2014 22:13:54]  <IllFlower> She really just wants to punch someone.
[16-Aug-2014 22:14:43]  <IllFlower> You'll have to say something to them. Makes things easier, all told.
[16-Aug-2014 22:15:21]  <ponicalica> "We know you violated your promise to your familiar.  Please turn yourself in."
[16-Aug-2014 22:15:33]  <Rig> Ayako: the best cop.
[16-Aug-2014 22:15:39]  <ponicalica> Ayako is blunt, blunter than she usually is, really.
[16-Aug-2014 22:15:54]  <Alicia> I laughed.
[16-Aug-2014 22:15:59]  <ponicalica> The lack of sleep must be getting her rather frustrated...
[16-Aug-2014 22:17:23]  <IllFlower> Youichi gives Ayako a skeptical look for a moment, then abruptly breaks out into laughter.
[16-Aug-2014 22:17:58]  <IllFlower> The restaurant isn't crowded per se, but there are enough people around to make their stares fairly awkward for Ayako to endure.
[16-Aug-2014 22:18:59]  <ponicalica> also making her forget the whole secrecy thing I guess
[16-Aug-2014 22:19:05]  <BGTB2005> "No, really."
[16-Aug-2014 22:19:16]  <ponicalica> Rin on the other hand literally does not give a shit
[16-Aug-2014 22:19:29]  <IllFlower> He turns to Miu. "I told you they'd find us, no?"
[16-Aug-2014 22:19:52]  <IllFlower> Miu twists her face in annoyed resignation.
[16-Aug-2014 22:20:34]  <IllFlower> "If we were going to do that," he says, turning back to face the Conservators, "why would we be here?"
[16-Aug-2014 22:20:46]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:2585:a734:d4e3:94> has joined #madokamadness
[16-Aug-2014 22:22:34]  <ponicalica> Rin decides to just blow up the restaurant, the next arc is all about them being chased by the government
[16-Aug-2014 22:22:43]  <Alicia> D:
[16-Aug-2014 22:24:48]  <IllFlower> Someone should probably answer Youichi, just saying.
[16-Aug-2014 22:25:19]  <IllFlower> ("BECAUSE Y'ALL DOUCHENOZZLES," Hikari is heard shouting from outside.)
[16-Aug-2014 22:25:23]  <ponicalica> Ayako freezes, suddenly realizing that there are civilians around.  She merely stares at the initiates with an almost demonic fury.
[16-Aug-2014 22:25:32]  <IllFlower> "almost"
[16-Aug-2014 22:25:37]  <ponicalica> "almost"
[16-Aug-2014 22:25:49]  <IllFlower> "fury"
[16-Aug-2014 22:25:49]  <BGTB2005> Rin ignores the question. "It would be in the best interests for all of us if you came peacefully."
[16-Aug-2014 22:25:50]  <ponicalica> well, witches are almost demons, right?
[16-Aug-2014 22:26:37]  <BGTB2005> close enough
[16-Aug-2014 22:27:18]  <IllFlower> "Easy enough for you to say," Youichi shoots back. "You get to do whatever you want for peace."
[16-Aug-2014 22:28:18]  <IllFlower> (I just had déjà vu about having had déjà vu about saying that.)
[16-Aug-2014 22:28:45]  <ponicalica> "Well, it's what we have to do when initiates become unruly and disrespect the Prophets."
[16-Aug-2014 22:29:13]  <Alicia> The sheer irony of Rin being the one protesting nonviolence in this case.
[16-Aug-2014 22:29:22]  <Alicia> Also lol @ douchenozzles
[16-Aug-2014 22:29:45]  <Alicia> ponicalica: IMO call in Hikari, her Justice Shpiel should drive them out.
[16-Aug-2014 22:30:01]  <IllFlower> "It's not like the Prophets give a damn about us. We take orders from walking stuffed animals."
[16-Aug-2014 22:31:32]  <IllFlower> Youichi grits his teeth. "They're machines, and they expect us to be machines too."
[16-Aug-2014 22:34:45]  <ponicalica> "If that's how you feel, why didn't you resign?"
[16-Aug-2014 22:35:23]  <IllFlower> "Whose magic is it, ours or theirs?
[16-Aug-2014 22:35:41]  <IllFlower> "You don't see too many familiars throwing themselves in the way of witches, do you?"
[16-Aug-2014 22:36:40]  <Alicia> (Yep, it's a good thing Hikari didn't go.)
[16-Aug-2014 22:37:30]  <IllFlower> Only took you seven minutes to do a total 180 there, flip-flopper!
[16-Aug-2014 22:38:37]  <Alicia> (That first comment was a joke. :| The shpiel wouldn't happen, but Hikari would be getting irritated in this case.)
[16-Aug-2014 22:42:35]  <Rig> Now pull Shii out of your pocket and throw her at him.
[16-Aug-2014 22:43:29]  <IllFlower> I'll be very disappointed if this scene doesn't end with a teary Rin pulling out her cannon and shouting "I never wanted to do this! But if I have to, I will!"
[16-Aug-2014 22:43:50]  <Alicia> No. D:
[16-Aug-2014 22:44:02]  <ponicalica> would Rin ever be teary about pulling out her cannon?
[16-Aug-2014 22:44:05]  <ponicalica> against Hikari, maybe
[16-Aug-2014 22:44:22]  <IllFlower> Maybe if Chiaki became a zombie.
[16-Aug-2014 22:44:35]  <IllFlower> Fifteen minutes.
[16-Aug-2014 22:44:37]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[16-Aug-2014 22:44:46]  <Alicia> Hikari: "At least she isn't Kazuki or Ayako."
[16-Aug-2014 22:44:49]  <Alicia> And yeah time.
[16-Aug-2014 22:45:41]  <ponicalica> yeah, I'm just not sure where to go from what they said right now
[16-Aug-2014 22:45:43]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005?
[16-Aug-2014 22:45:49]  <BGTB2005> same here
[16-Aug-2014 22:46:03]  <IllFlower> I suggest less thinking, more shouting.
[16-Aug-2014 22:46:16]  <Rig> Or agree and turn on Kazuki and Hikari.
[16-Aug-2014 22:46:31]  <Alicia> To me it looks like they're trying to anger Ayako.
[16-Aug-2014 22:46:52]  <ponicalica> maybe Ayako should punch one of them.
[16-Aug-2014 22:46:54]  <Alicia> Rig: Yikes.
[16-Aug-2014 22:47:33]  <IllFlower> Tsundere Ayako? Tsundere Ayako.
[16-Aug-2014 22:48:15]  <IllFlower> ("STUPID YOUICHI WHY DON'T YOU EVER NOTICE ME *punch*")
[16-Aug-2014 22:48:26]  <ponicalica> wouldn't that require, you know, a dere?
[16-Aug-2014 22:48:45]  <IllFlower> 'Sall you, partner.
[16-Aug-2014 22:48:47]  <Alicia> She was for Jun. Now she's just got a bit of tsun.
[16-Aug-2014 22:49:16]  <ponicalica> jundere
[16-Aug-2014 22:49:26]  <IllFlower> Are we punching?
[16-Aug-2014 22:49:40]  <Alicia> ponicalica: You could have Ayako be all like "We're taking this outside."
[16-Aug-2014 22:49:51]  <ponicalica> Alicia: and grabbing him by the shirt or whatever?
[16-Aug-2014 22:49:52]  <Alicia> And if he disagrees, Rin persuades them out.
[16-Aug-2014 22:49:59]  <ponicalica> "persuades"
[16-Aug-2014 22:50:02]  <BGTB2005> 'persuades'
[16-Aug-2014 22:50:10]  <Alicia> Or that, really. That is also in-character.
[16-Aug-2014 22:50:15]  <ponicalica> I think I like Alicia's idea though.
[16-Aug-2014 22:50:48]  <ponicalica> "Rin, I don't think we should deal with this."
[16-Aug-2014 22:50:54]  <Alicia> ponicalica, BGTB2005: I had the shirt-grabbing in mind, but I dunno if Ayako is that annoyed, hence me going to Rin. Because if anyone gratuitously uses force it's her.
[16-Aug-2014 22:51:01]  <Alicia> And I don't want a fight.
[16-Aug-2014 22:51:13]  <IllFlower> Ha-*ha*! So I have a surprise extra fifteen minutes for you guys.
[16-Aug-2014 22:51:19]  <ponicalica> well, Ayako's definitely annoyed, but I'm not sure she's that violent yet
[16-Aug-2014 22:51:29]  <ponicalica> even with the witch basically killing her sleep, etc.
[16-Aug-2014 22:52:11]  <BGTB2005> Rin doesn't exactly want to fight these people, given that she took their side a few sessions ago
[16-Aug-2014 22:52:18]  <Rig> I don’t think Ayako would drag them out, but I think she’d have some kind of words for them.
[16-Aug-2014 22:52:48]  <Alicia> Shirt-tugging is on the edge of edging towards violence. So, hum.
[16-Aug-2014 22:54:35]  <IllFlower> Any thoughts?
[16-Aug-2014 22:55:02]  <IllFlower> I don't think Youichi and friends are going to bother following anyone out of the restaurant, by the way.
[16-Aug-2014 22:55:16]  <IllFlower> Not unless you give them a very good reason to leave.
[16-Aug-2014 22:55:31]  <Alicia> Ayako could... trap them?
[16-Aug-2014 22:55:46]  <Alicia> And then we come in and Do Stuff and force them out?
[16-Aug-2014 22:56:00]  <IllFlower> Trap them? With what?
[16-Aug-2014 22:56:04]  <BGTB2005> "Ayako, you have any ideas to get them to leave quietly?"
[16-Aug-2014 22:56:09]  <Alicia> I dunno, magic stuff.
[16-Aug-2014 22:56:48]  <ponicalica> "I doubt it.  They're basically using the civilians here to prevent us from actually doing anything about them."
[16-Aug-2014 22:57:28]  <IllFlower> Or maybe they were just in the mood for some omelets.
[16-Aug-2014 22:57:49]  <Alicia> Only good people like omelets, and good people don't disobey the Order.
[16-Aug-2014 22:59:18]  <Rig> I really don’t know where to go other than sitting down with them and talking them down.
[16-Aug-2014 23:00:18]  <Alicia> Ayako could demand that Rin sets off the sprinklers and drives people out.
[16-Aug-2014 23:00:24]  <IllFlower> Well, if Kazuki's concerned, perhaps he should just waltz in and take control of the operation.
[16-Aug-2014 23:00:38]  <ponicalica> ("Ayako, you're hopeless.")
[16-Aug-2014 23:00:41]  <BGTB2005> Rin leans in closer to Ayako and whispers, "I apologise in advance for what I'm about to do."
[16-Aug-2014 23:00:50]  <IllFlower> What *is* she about to do?
[16-Aug-2014 23:01:02]  <IllFlower> Because if it's something ridiculous I might have to put the kibosh on it.
[16-Aug-2014 23:01:13]  <ponicalica> probably smoking out the place
[16-Aug-2014 23:01:15]  <BGTB2005> She's planning on setting the restrooms on fire
[16-Aug-2014 23:01:34]  <ponicalica> that'd probably literally kill civilians though
[16-Aug-2014 23:01:39]  <IllFlower> I don't think you want to get into a conflict with the fire department.
[16-Aug-2014 23:02:43]  <IllFlower> Those firehoses can take out a flying Rin at 20 meters.
[16-Aug-2014 23:02:47]  <BGTB2005> either that or try and through Youichi out a window
[16-Aug-2014 23:02:52]  <BGTB2005> *throw
[16-Aug-2014 23:04:02]  <BGTB2005> but I think setting the restroom trashcan on fire might convince everyone to leave the building?
[16-Aug-2014 23:04:02]  <Alicia> Taking all of the wrong lessons from Hikari.
[16-Aug-2014 23:04:20]  <Rig> Perhaps we should have sent in the person they were angry with.
[16-Aug-2014 23:04:41]  <Alicia> Ayako gets angry and forces Kazuki in.
[16-Aug-2014 23:05:07]  <IllFlower> You could just set off the alarm.
[16-Aug-2014 23:05:18]  <ponicalica> not as dramatic, IllFlower 
[16-Aug-2014 23:05:28]  <Rig> I need to head out soon?
[16-Aug-2014 23:05:35]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but far less ridiculous.
[16-Aug-2014 23:05:44]  <IllFlower> I have about ten minutes, so let's get some decisions going!
[16-Aug-2014 23:05:52]  <IllFlower> NO FIRES
[16-Aug-2014 23:05:56]  <BGTB2005> :<
[16-Aug-2014 23:06:15]  <ponicalica> maybe have Hikari pull the alarm
[16-Aug-2014 23:06:34]  <Alicia> I'm for that. If it gets stuff going.
[16-Aug-2014 23:07:05]  <IllFlower> You could just be like "I DON'T CARE, YOU'RE BREAKING THE RULES"
[16-Aug-2014 23:07:12]  <BGTB2005> i dunno, maybe Rin grabs a cup of coffee off the table and chucks the contents at Youichi?
[16-Aug-2014 23:07:21]  <IllFlower> See, that's believably dramatic.
[16-Aug-2014 23:07:27]  <Rig> I like that.
[16-Aug-2014 23:07:31]  <ponicalica> I like it too.
[16-Aug-2014 23:07:34]  <IllFlower> I still like the one where Ayako just punches someone, though.
[16-Aug-2014 23:07:42]  <Alicia> Decision: Hikari overhears them disobeying, and storms in to force them out, while making a scene and lets them all come out nicely.
[16-Aug-2014 23:07:45]  <Alicia> ??
[16-Aug-2014 23:07:46]  <BGTB2005> well maybe she'll get her chance
[16-Aug-2014 23:07:59]  <Alicia> (Her "chance" ends up being Rin. Payback!)
[16-Aug-2014 23:08:51]  <Alicia> (Anyone mind if I do that, or just let IF do it?)
[16-Aug-2014 23:09:13]  <IllFlower> Let's let the folks inside do something first...
[16-Aug-2014 23:09:33]  <IllFlower> SIX MINUTES
[16-Aug-2014 23:09:38]  <ponicalica> I'm just not sure if I want Ayako to throw that punch or not
[16-Aug-2014 23:10:06]  <IllFlower> Well, nothing else is happening, and she's got witchbrain, so may as well!
[16-Aug-2014 23:10:10]  <ponicalica> Okay
[16-Aug-2014 23:11:28]  <ponicalica> Ayako, increasingly annoyed, decides that these obvious cultists no longer deserve talking, and throws a punch at Youichi.
[16-Aug-2014 23:13:34]  <IllFlower> Just as Ayako sees Youichi collapse back into the padded booth seat behind him, a hand flies against Ayako's cheek, sending her spinning backwards.
[16-Aug-2014 23:14:20]  <IllFlower> Ritsuko has gotten up from her seat, and is staring daggers at the girl who just attacked her comrade.
[16-Aug-2014 23:14:36]  <ponicalica> daggers, huh
[16-Aug-2014 23:14:44]  <Alicia> Angry girls everywhere.
[16-Aug-2014 23:15:00]  <ponicalica> ("daggers killed my love, you insensitive clod")
[16-Aug-2014 23:15:08]  <Rig> So much anger. And Kazuki isn’t even doing anything.
[16-Aug-2014 23:15:27]  <BGTB2005> 'Angry Girls' almost sounds like an Angry Birds knockoff...
[16-Aug-2014 23:17:12]  <IllFlower> Well, unless you have something you really need to get out of your system now, we're out of time.
[16-Aug-2014 23:17:34]  <ponicalica> I think this is a good cliffhanger
[16-Aug-2014 23:17:51]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[16-Aug-2014 23:18:12]  <Rig> It was fun.
[16-Aug-2014 23:18:15]  <Alicia> Until later today, or this week?
[16-Aug-2014 23:18:30]  <IllFlower> All right, then. Let's pick up next time, which I don't know when that's going to be.
[16-Aug-2014 23:19:03]  <IllFlower> Tomorrow? If not, a while from now!
[16-Aug-2014 23:19:22]  <Rig> Tomorrow might work for me.
[16-Aug-2014 23:19:28]  <Rig> Hopefully we can get further.
[16-Aug-2014 23:19:31]  <Rig> Anyway, food.
[16-Aug-2014 23:19:33]  *** Rig <~Iverum@38.109.176.163> has quit IRC (Quit: Rig)
[16-Aug-2014 23:19:38]  <Alicia> I'd be good with tomorrow, honestly.
[16-Aug-2014 23:19:42]  <Alicia> I'm excited for this.
[16-Aug-2014 23:19:55]  <IllFlower> Okay, then. Thanks for playing, everyone. Until then!
