@time=2014-08-16T20:33:07.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"So they lied to their familiar."  Ayako looks at Kazuki.  "Do we have any idea where they may be?"

@time=2014-08-16T20:38:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I had someone call her here," Shii explains.

@time=2014-08-16T20:41:02.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We were told that you had lost your faith in the Order and resigned.  Or is that another lie?"
@time=2014-08-16T20:42:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Narumi makes a face. "Pyunpyun revoked my powers this morning."
@time=2014-08-16T20:42:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Pyunpyun, for his part, just nods at Ayako.
@time=2014-08-16T20:48:37.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sorry, trying to figure out my financials for the school year. Now I’m actually here and hopefully not having a panic attack.
@time=2014-08-16T20:49:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hello there." Hikari nods in her direction before turning to Pyunpyun and Shii. "In any case, I'm assuming you called all of us in here for something, so just what is it?"

@time=2014-08-16T20:54:00.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki nods. He sort of expected something like this after hearing the news last night.
@time=2014-08-16T20:54:13.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So the dude and the girl and a new girl.
@time=2014-08-16T20:54:17.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Fun.

@time=2014-08-16T20:55:01.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Oh wait, yeah, I misread Miu in the chart. All of'em.
@time=2014-08-16T20:56:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(I should remind everyone that Narumi can't see or hear the familiars now that she's depowered.)

@time=2014-08-16T20:57:09.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: because Kazuki is a compulsive liar
@time=2014-08-16T20:57:29.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I thought he only lied when - ... well, yeah, true. So far at least.
@time=2014-08-16T20:58:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“Some of your former group members have gone missing,” Kazuki says to Narumi.
@time=2014-08-16T20:58:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He rattles off the names. “Do you know where they might be?

@time=2014-08-16T20:59:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"They didn't go through with the ritual after all...?" Narumi says, mostly to herself.
@time=2014-08-16T20:59:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She stares down at the ground for a second, then answers.
@time=2014-08-16T21:01:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I don't know. I suspect you and the girl over there might have some ideas, though." Narumi points a finger straight at Rin. "I know when someone's trying to pull the strings."
@time=2014-08-16T21:01:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :pfffff
@time=2014-08-16T21:01:57.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"...You told them?"
@time=2014-08-16T21:02:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“Told them what?”

@time=2014-08-16T21:04:27.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You were there, you should know."
@time=2014-08-16T21:06:11.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako stares at Rin and Kazuki.  "What the hell are you two doing without telling me or Hikari?"
@time=2014-08-16T21:06:24.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"But after you left, I went looking for somewhere Narumi could hold a private ceremony, and then I learned Sakura never had any intention of letting her go through with it."
@time=2014-08-16T21:06:29.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The best part is that I’m actually confused.
@time=2014-08-16T21:07:42.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :and IllFlower was expecting this to be simple
@time=2014-08-16T21:08:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Until I figured out a way to make it complicated!
@time=2014-08-16T21:08:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Right, so who's confused about what?
@time=2014-08-16T21:08:55.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Did Rin actualy do something subterfugerous?
@time=2014-08-16T21:09:09.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She went behind everyone's back and talked to Narumi about a ceremony.
@time=2014-08-16T21:09:19.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Presumably she thought she was doing it with the other conservators' blessing
@time=2014-08-16T21:09:24.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :except maybe Ayako's
@time=2014-08-16T21:09:29.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she thought she had the backing of the -- yeah
@time=2014-08-16T21:09:40.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki sighs, “No one knows where the three rogue initiaties are. Rin… did you tell them about the location you found?”
@time=2014-08-16T21:09:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You guys have made Narumi a wee bit paranoid, in case that wasn't obvious.
@time=2014-08-16T21:09:57.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"No, I only told Narumi."
@time=2014-08-16T21:10:43.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“And Narumi told them?” Kazuki looks to her.
@time=2014-08-16T21:11:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I doubt I was the first," Narumi answers.
@time=2014-08-16T21:12:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"But I was trying to sort everything out with Ritsuko last night, and we talked about it for a while. So, if you want the technically accurate answer, yes."
@time=2014-08-16T21:15:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki nods. “Okay, I see. Thank you.” He tries to keep his cool and not let this get out of hand again.
@time=2014-08-16T21:15:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He turns to the girls. “Can we agree that these rogue initiates are a problem?"
@time=2014-08-16T21:16:30.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Definitely.  At this point, they've flat-out rejected the authority of their familiar."
@time=2014-08-16T21:17:18.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Of course."
@time=2014-08-16T21:18:14.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Rin?"  Ayako stares.
@time=2014-08-16T21:18:19.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki looks at Rin.

@time=2014-08-16T21:19:29.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin glares back at Kazuki. "Yeah, whatever."
@time=2014-08-16T21:19:37.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari starts off towards the door. "Whether she agrees or not isn't the issue. What we need to do is find them, quickly."

@time=2014-08-16T21:26:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin, after spending some more time glaring at Kazuki, heads out of the door, not really bothering to check if the other three are following her. She keeps her head low as she passes Narumi on her way out.
@time=2014-08-16T21:26:57.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako leaves following after Rin, not saying much except a few whispers to Hikari.
@time=2014-08-16T21:28:26.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki pauses before following the girls. “Narumi, I’m sorry that this happened. I… I am sorry.” He steps out of the room quickly to follow the girls.
@time=2014-08-16T21:29:02.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :sorry won't bring back my goddamn honey
@time=2014-08-16T21:30:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Narumi says nothing, simply watching the Conservators trail down the hallway and out of sight.
@time=2014-08-16T21:30:43.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :back, had to take care of something
@time=2014-08-16T21:31:00.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :also couldn't really figure out anything to add
@time=2014-08-16T21:31:04.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Ayako, I think it'd be a good idea if you tracked Rin while we follow. Make sure she isn't trying to trick us." She whispers, as Kazuki approaches. "What took you?" Her tone is jocular, though a bit needly.
@time=2014-08-16T21:31:40.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Tracked her?  There's really not much we can do except hope she doesn't turn on us again, really."
@time=2014-08-16T21:32:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“This went really wrong. Narumi… probably wasn’t right for the Order, but leaving on these terms isn’t what I wanted.”
@time=2014-08-16T21:32:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Is Kazuki trying to get Narumi to get back together with him or what?
@time=2014-08-16T21:33:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Please, babe, I didn't mean those terrible things I said. You know me, come on, please..."
@time=2014-08-16T21:33:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway - the location Rin gives is out in the suburbs, tucked away inside a tangle of alleys some distance from the neighborhood train station. Rin was right about one thing - it seems like nobody would find this place unless they were directed to it, and those directions would be pretty long.
@time=2014-08-16T21:34:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :With a sigh, she gives up the idea. Guess being prepared is the only thing they can do.

@time=2014-08-16T21:39:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :At the center of the otherwise deserted concrete square, darkened by afternoon shadows, is a small basket of white flowers with a card sticking out in the middle. It reads, in black felt-tip pen, "Hatsue Tsuruoka 1993-2013."
@time=2014-08-16T21:41:07.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki eyes the flowers before scanning around the edges of the courtyard.

@time=2014-08-16T21:42:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari is offended.
@time=2014-08-16T21:43:39.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako puts a hand out slightly toward the basket of flowers, seeking the magical signs of an illegal ceremony.
@time=2014-08-16T21:44:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The basket emits a faint silver glow as Ayako performs her divination.

@time=2014-08-16T21:47:37.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“Any signs of where they might have gone?” Kazuki asks as he approaches the basket.

@time=2014-08-16T21:49:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki plucks the card from the basket and sends a pulse of magical power through it, burning it to ash instantly.
@time=2014-08-16T21:49:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The action doesn’t fix the problem, he knows, but he feels like something had to be done.

@time=2014-08-16T21:50:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Still under the pull of Ayako's magic, the ashes collapse in the distinctly unnatural shape of an arrowhead, pointing to what Kazuki reckons by the sun is somwhere northeast.

@time=2014-08-16T21:52:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I like how you apologize to Narumi, then harm her little memorial.
@time=2014-08-16T21:52:21.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It’s not a memorial to Narumi.
@time=2014-08-16T21:52:32.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's her sister's.
@time=2014-08-16T21:52:41.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But yeah, Kazuki is incredibly two-faced.

@time=2014-08-16T22:57:49.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Only good people like omelets, and good people don't disobey the Order.
@time=2014-08-16T22:59:18.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I really don’t know where to go other than sitting down with them and talking them down.
@time=2014-08-16T23:00:18.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako could demand that Rin sets off the sprinklers and drives people out.
@time=2014-08-16T23:00:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, if Kazuki's concerned, perhaps he should just waltz in and take control of the operation.
@time=2014-08-16T23:00:38.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("Ayako, you're hopeless.")
@time=2014-08-16T23:00:41.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin leans in closer to Ayako and whispers, "I apologise in advance for what I'm about to do."
@time=2014-08-16T23:00:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What *is* she about to do?
@time=2014-08-16T23:01:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Because if it's something ridiculous I might have to put the kibosh on it.
@time=2014-08-16T23:01:13.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :probably smoking out the place
@time=2014-08-16T23:01:15.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She's planning on setting the restrooms on fire
@time=2014-08-16T23:01:34.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :that'd probably literally kill civilians though
@time=2014-08-16T23:01:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't think you want to get into a conflict with the fire department.
@time=2014-08-16T23:02:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Those firehoses can take out a flying Rin at 20 meters.
@time=2014-08-16T23:02:47.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :either that or try and through Youichi out a window
@time=2014-08-16T23:02:52.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :*throw
@time=2014-08-16T23:04:02.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but I think setting the restroom trashcan on fire might convince everyone to leave the building?
@time=2014-08-16T23:04:02.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Taking all of the wrong lessons from Hikari.
@time=2014-08-16T23:04:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Perhaps we should have sent in the person they were angry with.
@time=2014-08-16T23:04:41.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako gets angry and forces Kazuki in.
@time=2014-08-16T23:05:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You could just set off the alarm.
@time=2014-08-16T23:05:18.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :not as dramatic, IllFlower 
@time=2014-08-16T23:05:28.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I need to head out soon?
@time=2014-08-16T23:05:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, but far less ridiculous.
@time=2014-08-16T23:05:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I have about ten minutes, so let's get some decisions going!
@time=2014-08-16T23:05:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :NO FIRES
@time=2014-08-16T23:05:56.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness ::<
@time=2014-08-16T23:06:15.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :maybe have Hikari pull the alarm
@time=2014-08-16T23:06:34.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm for that. If it gets stuff going.
@time=2014-08-16T23:07:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You could just be like "I DON'T CARE, YOU'RE BREAKING THE RULES"
@time=2014-08-16T23:07:12.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :i dunno, maybe Rin grabs a cup of coffee off the table and chucks the contents at Youichi?
@time=2014-08-16T23:07:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :See, that's believably dramatic.
@time=2014-08-16T23:07:27.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I like that.
@time=2014-08-16T23:07:31.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I like it too.
@time=2014-08-16T23:07:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I still like the one where Ayako just punches someone, though.
@time=2014-08-16T23:07:42.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Decision: Hikari overhears them disobeying, and storms in to force them out, while making a scene and lets them all come out nicely.
@time=2014-08-16T23:07:45.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :??
@time=2014-08-16T23:07:46.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well maybe she'll get her chance
@time=2014-08-16T23:07:59.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Her "chance" ends up being Rin. Payback!)
@time=2014-08-16T23:08:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Anyone mind if I do that, or just let IF do it?)
@time=2014-08-16T23:09:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let's let the folks inside do something first...
@time=2014-08-16T23:09:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :SIX MINUTES
@time=2014-08-16T23:09:38.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm just not sure if I want Ayako to throw that punch or not
@time=2014-08-16T23:10:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, nothing else is happening, and she's got witchbrain, so may as well!
@time=2014-08-16T23:10:10.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay
@time=2014-08-16T23:11:28.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako, increasingly annoyed, decides that these obvious cultists no longer deserve talking, and throws a punch at Youichi.
@time=2014-08-16T23:13:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just as Ayako sees Youichi collapse back into the padded booth seat behind him, a hand flies against Ayako's cheek, sending her spinning backwards.
@time=2014-08-16T23:14:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ritsuko has gotten up from her seat, and is staring daggers at the girl who just attacked her comrade.
@time=2014-08-16T23:14:36.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :daggers, huh
@time=2014-08-16T23:14:44.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Angry girls everywhere.
@time=2014-08-16T23:15:00.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("daggers killed my love, you insensitive clod")
@time=2014-08-16T23:15:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So much anger. And Kazuki isn’t even doing anything.
@time=2014-08-16T23:15:27.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :'Angry Girls' almost sounds like an Angry Birds knockoff...
@time=2014-08-16T23:17:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, unless you have something you really need to get out of your system now, we're out of time.
@time=2014-08-16T23:17:34.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think this is a good cliffhanger
@time=2014-08-16T23:17:51.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-08-16T23:18:12.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It was fun.
@time=2014-08-16T23:18:15.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Until later today, or this week?
@time=2014-08-16T23:18:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, then. Let's pick up next time, which I don't know when that's going to be.
@time=2014-08-16T23:19:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Tomorrow? If not, a while from now!
@time=2014-08-16T23:19:22.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Tomorrow might work for me.
@time=2014-08-16T23:19:28.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hopefully we can get further.
@time=2014-08-16T23:19:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, food.
@time=2014-08-16T23:19:33.000Z :Rig QUIT :Quit: Rig
@time=2014-08-16T23:19:38.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd be good with tomorrow, honestly.
@time=2014-08-16T23:19:42.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm excited for this.
@time=2014-08-16T23:19:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, then. Thanks for playing, everyone. Until then!
