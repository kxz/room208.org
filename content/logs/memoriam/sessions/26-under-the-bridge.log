@time=2014-07-12T20:05:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii has opened the window and set fans in the four corners of her office to full blast -- how she's managed to do that without opposable thumbs is a mystery for another day -- but regardless it's barely helping.
@time=2014-07-12T20:06:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The Conservators shift around uncomfortably, trying to keep their clothes from sticking too thoroughly to their skin.
@time=2014-07-12T20:06:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii paces around on top of her desk, as she usually does when delivering the news.
@time=2014-07-12T20:06:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It's been a long day," she says. "Lots of developments."

@time=2014-07-12T20:10:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Someone only she would recognize out of this group, now that everyone else who would is either retired or dead. Hint.
@time=2014-07-12T20:11:10.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako suddenly remebers.  "Is it one of Kotomi's cult?"
@time=2014-07-12T20:11:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Not just 'one of,'" Shii says.
@time=2014-07-12T20:12:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The leader herself."
@time=2014-07-12T20:13:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki stands quietly in the back of the group. He recognizes the name Kotomi, but only vaguely. His father must have mentioned it.
@time=2014-07-12T20:13:06.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako shudders as she thinks back to the gym building ablaze
@time=2014-07-12T20:13:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"How much do the rest of you know about Kotomi Taniguchi?" Shii asks the remaining three.
@time=2014-07-12T20:14:41.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari turns to Ayako, surprised, before looking back at Shii. "I've never heard of the name before... and just what was this cult for?"
@time=2014-07-12T20:14:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki stays quiet. He wants to see what the others know before he speaks up.

@time=2014-07-12T20:17:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii steps in. "It's all right, Ayako. I'll explain."
@time=2014-07-12T20:17:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She begins pacing again.
@time=2014-07-12T20:18:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The implication was that they wanted to learn how to independently grant magical abilities. Conduct their own initiations, that sort of thing.

@time=2014-07-12T20:20:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii points to a map on the desk. "There's also been an increase in witch activity in Miyahama over the past few weeks. I suspect this isn't an unrelated phenomenon."

@time=2014-07-12T20:21:06.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki speaks up, “Why weren’t they run down after they were exposed the first time?"
@time=2014-07-12T20:21:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii freezes. She fires a glance over at Ayako.
@time=2014-07-12T20:23:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Most of her followers have been apprehended," she begins, carefully choosing her words. "Miss Taniguchi herself overpowered the team sent to capture her, though, and she hasn't been seen since. Until now, at least, if this report is to be believed."
