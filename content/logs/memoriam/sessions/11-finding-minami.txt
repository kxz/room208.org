[09-Feb-2014 00:19:54]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's go ahead, then.
[09-Feb-2014 00:20:01]  <IllFlower> We'll try to set the scene...
[09-Feb-2014 00:20:40]  <IllFlower> Ayako and Jun are on their way out to investigate Sanae's death.
[09-Feb-2014 00:21:00]  <IllFlower> I'm going to hazard a guess and say Hibiki's already there, doing her own thing.
[09-Feb-2014 00:21:31]  <IllFlower> She might be an, uh, independent enforcement agent for the time being or something.
[09-Feb-2014 00:21:39]  <saladofstones> (I'm a magical meter maid)]
[09-Feb-2014 00:22:03]  <IllFlower> ("WHO ARE YOU" "I COULD ASK THE SAME QUESTION" "I'M A CONSERVATOR" "NO I AM" "SHUT UP")
[09-Feb-2014 00:22:47]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@182.55.188.37> has joined #madokamadness
[09-Feb-2014 00:22:56]  <IllFlower> So presumably Ayako and Jun arrive at the scene, where Hibiki's already present.
[09-Feb-2014 00:23:30]  <ponicalica> Did Shii inform us of Hibiki's presence?
[09-Feb-2014 00:23:32]  <Rig> I imagine Miss Dead Girl is slumped unceremoniously on the ground near the shrine entrance?
[09-Feb-2014 00:23:43]  <saladofstones> (time to go through some logs)
[09-Feb-2014 00:23:48]  <IllFlower> Her body may have already been taken away by the relevant authorities.
[09-Feb-2014 00:24:07]  <IllFlower> Depends on whether or not you guys want to work with the body present or not.
[09-Feb-2014 00:24:20]  <Rig> Let's go with it being taken away.
[09-Feb-2014 00:24:30]  <saladofstones> (Given hibiki's background in sleuthing, maybe I was there before it was taken away)
[09-Feb-2014 00:24:44]  <Barcode> ^
[09-Feb-2014 00:25:03]  <IllFlower> Could be the case.
[09-Feb-2014 00:25:09]  <ponicalica> Or she snuck into the police building and examined it after. :P
[09-Feb-2014 00:25:27]  <IllFlower> I think the civilian authorities would have it at that point.
[09-Feb-2014 00:25:37]  <saladofstones> (I am not going to be a magical sneaking serbian today)
[09-Feb-2014 00:25:43]  <Rig> Mind if I begin the scene then?
[09-Feb-2014 00:25:53]  <IllFlower> No, go ahead.
[09-Feb-2014 00:25:53]  <ponicalica> Go ahead.
[09-Feb-2014 00:27:32]  <Rig> Jun and Ayako jog up the steps to the shrine and step inside. Sodium lights cast a yellow glow over the single girl standing near the center. She doesn't look dead, but the lights aren't helping her complexion. Jun glances at Ayako. "We were supposed to be the boots on the ground for this one, right?"
[09-Feb-2014 00:27:53]  <IllFlower> I like this.
[09-Feb-2014 00:28:55]  <Rig> "Hey, are you... Sanae?" Jun calls out cautiously.
[09-Feb-2014 00:29:17]  <saladofstones> (for reference, you're calling out to Hibiki right?)
[09-Feb-2014 00:29:21]  <Rig> Yeah.
[09-Feb-2014 00:30:01]  * saladofstones jumps, if she had a skeleton inside of her, it would have been outside
[09-Feb-2014 00:30:16]  <Rig> I'm trying to grab reference pictures for shrines in Tokyo, but I can't find any good interior pictures. IllFlower, do you have any?
[09-Feb-2014 00:30:22]  <IllFlower> ("A whispered voice says, 'I'm over here! Over here!'")
[09-Feb-2014 00:31:03]  <saladofstones> <Barcode> also i have no idea what the tech trees are

[09-Feb-2014 00:31:32]  <IllFlower> I think you guys would be outside. People don't generally step into the actual interior, far as I know.
[09-Feb-2014 00:31:44]  <ponicalica> I'm pretty sure I recognize the squiggly paper from anime
[09-Feb-2014 00:31:48]  <Rig> Okay. Cool.
[09-Feb-2014 00:32:07]  <saladofstones> Illflower: given we're megucas, it seems symbolic to be inside

[09-Feb-2014 00:32:41]  <IllFlower> saladofstones: I mean of the buildings.
[09-Feb-2014 00:33:37]  <IllFlower> Is Hibiki just going to jump, or does she have words for the newcomers? :p
[09-Feb-2014 00:34:03]  <Barcode> hibiki continues jumping.
[09-Feb-2014 00:34:12]  <Rig> Hibiki floats away
[09-Feb-2014 00:34:16]  <ponicalica> hibiki bunny-hops outside the shrine.
[09-Feb-2014 00:34:17]  <saladofstones> (I'm flyiing but I'm looking through old logs to figure whats what)
[09-Feb-2014 00:34:18]  <Rig> Air cancelling.
[09-Feb-2014 00:34:47]  <Barcode> saladofstones: see last session when the magic cat thing appeared.
[09-Feb-2014 00:34:49]  <Barcode> shin. shii. whatever.
[09-Feb-2014 00:34:58]  <Barcode> that's probably where your char would get involved.
[09-Feb-2014 00:35:20]  <IllFlower> Oh, are you looking for information on Sanae? Long story short, she got killed by a witch ambush.
[09-Feb-2014 00:35:32]  <saladofstones> rip touhou
[09-Feb-2014 00:35:34]  <IllFlower> Suspicions are that this was set up by another magical party.
[09-Feb-2014 00:35:41]  <Rig> Low-level civil war.
[09-Feb-2014 00:35:43]  <saladofstones> ah okay
[09-Feb-2014 00:35:55]  <saladofstones> interesting with regards to my character
[09-Feb-2014 00:35:57]  <saladofstones> now to RP
[09-Feb-2014 00:37:43]  <saladofstones> "W-who is out there?"
[09-Feb-2014 00:38:00]  <saladofstones> Is all she can manage, before her survival instincts cause her to backpedal away
[09-Feb-2014 00:38:05]  <saladofstones> The delay is because of time warps
[09-Feb-2014 00:38:15]  * Barcode nods
[09-Feb-2014 00:38:49]  <ponicalica> "This is Ayako Minakami and Jun Takanashi.  We're here to help."
[09-Feb-2014 00:40:21]  <IllFlower> 「来ないでええええぇぇぇっ」
[09-Feb-2014 00:40:50]  <ponicalica> what is IllFlower saying
[09-Feb-2014 00:40:55]  <Barcode> stand baaaack, i think
[09-Feb-2014 00:40:58]  <saladofstones> "Oohokay I-- I'm Wakahisa, I don't need any help though. Bodies gone, witch is gone"
[09-Feb-2014 00:41:07]  <saladofstones> (NANI?)
[09-Feb-2014 00:41:59]  <IllFlower> ("Someone actually named Wakahisa? Oh, uh, um... oops.")
[09-Feb-2014 00:42:22]  <Rig> Jun blink at the name. She may have made a mistake earlier. "You're an initiate? We were told we were the only ones around?"
[09-Feb-2014 00:42:28]  <Barcode> lol
[09-Feb-2014 00:42:41]  <Rig> (For reference, Jun used a fake name last session)
[09-Feb-2014 00:43:20]  <ponicalica> ("Should've used a more ridiculous name.  «Shirayuki» maybe.  Nobody actually has that name.")
[09-Feb-2014 00:44:28]  <saladofstones> "o-of course they would say that" she says biting her thumb in the most fucking anime way possible, She stammers out, "This place is off limits to--- nevermind, what are you doing here?"
[09-Feb-2014 00:45:16]  <saladofstones> (For whatever reason, I decided to play hibiki like genocider)
[09-Feb-2014 00:45:27]  <Rig> "We were told to investigate." Jun advances on the girl. "You are here because?"
[09-Feb-2014 00:45:30]  <ponicalica> "We're Conservators.  We're here to inestigate the death of Sanae Tanimura."
[09-Feb-2014 00:46:27]  <IllFlower> That was one of my least favorite Miyuki Sawashiro roles. `_`
[09-Feb-2014 00:46:47]  *** SpruceZeus|away is now known as SpruceZeus
[09-Feb-2014 00:47:04]  <saladofstones> You're just jelly that she loves togami
[09-Feb-2014 00:47:12]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[09-Feb-2014 00:47:49]  <Buttercupistiny> that does not sound like something to be jelly of tbh
[09-Feb-2014 00:47:54]  <saladofstones> "Well I-imagine this! I was told to look for Sanae's body to figure out why she's dead, and I didn't get any time to-- I'm here to find out why she got killed."
[09-Feb-2014 00:48:16]  <ponicalica> "Do you have any leads?"
[09-Feb-2014 00:48:43]  <saladofstones> "Which is hard since" she motions to the crime scene "No bod-- No leads, no clues either, not that I could say anything useful"
[09-Feb-2014 00:49:21]  <Rig> Jun circles around the edge of the lights, looking for anything left behind by the police or the witch.
[09-Feb-2014 00:49:36]  <saladofstones> (For the record, what does the shrine look like currently?)
[09-Feb-2014 00:49:50]  <Barcode> i like this character. also, brb, dinner
[09-Feb-2014 00:49:56]  <saladofstones> "Soso why are you looking for Sanae?"
[09-Feb-2014 00:50:05]  <Barcode> (though i remember less unsteadiness during initiation. whatever)
[09-Feb-2014 00:50:24]  <saladofstones> Barcode: I didn't like how hibiki was during initiation
[09-Feb-2014 00:50:33]  <IllFlower> saladofstones: It looks like a fairly typical shrine. Stairs, gates, buildings.
[09-Feb-2014 00:50:47]  <IllFlower> Not particularly big.
[09-Feb-2014 00:50:54]  <IllFlower> It's still an urban area, after all.
[09-Feb-2014 00:51:27]  <IllFlower> Rig: Conveniently enough, you find a small wallet.
[09-Feb-2014 00:51:31]  <saladofstones> (Sorry to derail, but could I use 1d8 eye for details with the implication that I've looked before ponirig showed up?)
[09-Feb-2014 00:52:09]  <Rig> Jun picks up the wallet and flips it open, hoping to find some ID.
[09-Feb-2014 00:52:11]  <IllFlower> Inside it is Sanae Tanimura's school identification booklet, a picture of her with another boy about her age, and somewhere on the order of 3000 yen.
[09-Feb-2014 00:52:24]  <IllFlower> saladofstones: You're not in a conflict, dice rolling doesn't enter into the equation.
[09-Feb-2014 00:52:29]  <ponicalica> ("3000 yen?  Let's go buy some food.")
[09-Feb-2014 00:52:34]  <Rig> 3 bucks
[09-Feb-2014 00:52:38]  <ponicalica> "Jun, did you find anything interesting?"
[09-Feb-2014 00:52:42]  <ponicalica> Rig: pretty sure it's closer to thirty
[09-Feb-2014 00:52:45]  <Rig> Right.
[09-Feb-2014 00:52:48]  <saladofstones> "I've already cchecked the money, the wallet, I mean, don't mess with a crime scene"
[09-Feb-2014 00:52:52]  <Rig> Still not a ton.
[09-Feb-2014 00:53:07]  <saladofstones> (totally not suspicious ahoy)
[09-Feb-2014 00:53:26]  <IllFlower> As mentioned, the police have already done what they want with the scene. They think it's a suicide.
[09-Feb-2014 00:53:59]  <Rig> Jun turns to face Wakahisa. "We're the ones who were told to investigate. I'm still not certain why you're here."
[09-Feb-2014 00:54:01]  <saladofstones> (what school is on the booklet)
[09-Feb-2014 00:54:45]  <saladofstones> "I said, "I'm here to figure out why Sanae is dead, but I don't know since the police took it away. Anyways, I was here first, so please don't touch things"
[09-Feb-2014 00:55:12]  <Rig> Jun pockets the wallet.
[09-Feb-2014 00:55:42]  <IllFlower> Phone Microwave High School (name subject to change). It's always Phone Microwave High School (etc.).
[09-Feb-2014 00:55:47]  <ponicalica> "I don't know who you are but we're here to investigate the death of a magical girl and we have full authority as Conservators to do what we wish.  Please don't get in our way, Wakahisa."
[09-Feb-2014 00:56:16]  <saladofstones> "Rrightthey said I need to be less" she mutters to herself, then sighing, "I wass sent here to investigate whether it was a witch"
[09-Feb-2014 00:56:42]  <Rig> "And your conclusion?"
[09-Feb-2014 00:56:56]  <IllFlower> Hibiki *is* a Conservator, I think that needs to be mentioned...
[09-Feb-2014 00:57:17]  <ponicalica> Hibiki hasn't mentioned it, so... >_>
[09-Feb-2014 00:57:20]  <saladofstones> she pauses, thinking about whether or not to go on, "I'm a conservator aswellyoujerks."
[09-Feb-2014 00:57:30]  <ponicalica> a swell, you jerks
[09-Feb-2014 00:57:40]  <saladofstones> you swell bunch of jerks
[09-Feb-2014 00:58:10]  <Rig> "You should probably open with that next time," Jun says. She relaxes a little. "Do you think a witch got to her?"
[09-Feb-2014 00:58:38]  <saladofstones> "complicated situation" she stammers out, "She did, but I don't think she was looking for it. Ambush? Maybe trap"
[09-Feb-2014 00:58:50]  <IllFlower> I guess that throws the whole crest thing from a few sessions ago out the window. Or maybe those things are only present when they're transformed.
[09-Feb-2014 00:58:57]  <ponicalica> I kind of assumed the latter
[09-Feb-2014 00:59:01]  <ponicalica> since it'd be an element of the costume.
[09-Feb-2014 00:59:12]  <ponicalica> and we have no reason to be transformed at the moment
[09-Feb-2014 00:59:13]  <saladofstones> (I'd imagine that it'd be low key, unless megucas can sense other megcas)
[09-Feb-2014 00:59:15]  *** MobileAvenue <~CentralAv@cpe-65-24-227-116.insight.res.rr.com> has joined #madokamadness

[09-Feb-2014 00:59:35]  <saladofstones> (This is a small note, was sanae transformed at her death?)
[09-Feb-2014 00:59:56]  <ponicalica> would you rather be in: a Gen Urobuchi anime, or Danganronpa?
[09-Feb-2014 01:00:07]  <saladofstones> why not combine them?
[09-Feb-2014 01:00:08]  <IllFlower> One presumes she tried to put up a fight, but again that's something that nobody else would have witnessed.
[09-Feb-2014 01:00:16]  <IllFlower> In other words, it's not too relevant.
[09-Feb-2014 01:00:29]  <ponicalica> saladofstones: the despair would be too much
[09-Feb-2014 01:00:39]  <saladofstones> (it was junkos)
[09-Feb-2014 01:00:51]  <Rig> IllFlower: Yeah, I assumed the crest was either a transformation thing or something you had to flash like a badge.
[09-Feb-2014 01:01:15]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yeah, fair enough.
[09-Feb-2014 01:01:53]  <Rig> "Any trace of the witch that got her?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:02:02]  <saladofstones> "traces that traces were removed"
[09-Feb-2014 01:02:16]  <Rig> "By police or by someone magical?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:02:57]  <saladofstones> shaking of head contempously, "do police know magic?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:03:23]  <ponicalica> While Jun and Hibiki discuss, Ayako tries to sense any remaining magical "scent" in the air not masked by whatever cover-up or the presence of three Conservators.
[09-Feb-2014 01:04:24]  <saladofstones> "Butbut I don't believe in conspiracies! It could have faded-- maybe someone accidently did it. You heard the rumors of conflicts right? Anyways, why are you here?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:04:58]  <Rig> "I told you. We were told we were the closest team to the murder. We were sent to investigate by our familiar."
[09-Feb-2014 01:05:00]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Ayako might try to perform a spell to reveal magical traces?
[09-Feb-2014 01:05:06]  <ponicalica> Yeah.
[09-Feb-2014 01:05:30]  <saladofstones> "oh you're those people."
[09-Feb-2014 01:06:06]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Might want to command the others' attention first.
[09-Feb-2014 01:06:15]  <IllFlower> I hear lipstick drawings are attention grabbers.
[09-Feb-2014 01:06:41]  <Rig> "Good. You've heard of us then."
[09-Feb-2014 01:07:02]  <Rig> Jun checks the clock on her phone again.
[09-Feb-2014 01:07:03]  <saladofstones> "annd if I did things right, you haven't of me" almost self-deprecition mixed in with extreme bitternesss
[09-Feb-2014 01:07:14]  <saladofstones> lel at the right now by the way
[09-Feb-2014 01:07:28]  <saladofstones> "Wwhats the other person doing?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:08:00]  <ponicalica> Ayako draws a spoked wheel on the ground in preparation for a spell that will amplify the magical traces from the previous initiates to have crossed the path.
[09-Feb-2014 01:10:36]  <saladofstones> (paging the illflower)
[09-Feb-2014 01:10:49]  <IllFlower> Just a second.
[09-Feb-2014 01:11:21]  <IllFlower> The red markings on the ground begin to shimmer, momentarily spooking Hibiki.
[09-Feb-2014 01:12:17]  <IllFlower> After a moment, the glowing lines shift to form a different image.
[09-Feb-2014 01:12:36]  <IllFlower> It looks unmistakably like a hand holding a flaming torch.
[09-Feb-2014 01:12:42]  <IllFlower> After a few moments, the image dispels.
[09-Feb-2014 01:13:04]  <Rig> "Right, well, that's ominous."
[09-Feb-2014 01:13:32]  <Rig> "Looks like it's the same witch as the one that attacked Aki."
[09-Feb-2014 01:15:50]  <ponicalica> "Do you think the same people could have it out for both of them?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:16:23]  <IllFlower> Viva la revolution.
[09-Feb-2014 01:18:22]  <ponicalica> isn't it revolucion, and also a diacritic on one of the vowels
[09-Feb-2014 01:18:40]  <saladofstones> "A torch huh"
[09-Feb-2014 01:18:42]  <Rig> Jun takes the wallet out and looks at the picture again.
[09-Feb-2014 01:18:59]  <saladofstones> "Recoqnize the boy by any chance?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:19:33]  <IllFlower> There's no particular reason she would.
[09-Feb-2014 01:19:36]  <Rig> "It looks familiar, but no." Jun says. She blinks a few times, her eyes down.
[09-Feb-2014 01:19:56]  <IllFlower> 3d4 D:
[09-Feb-2014 01:20:01]  <saladofstones> god damnit
[09-Feb-2014 01:20:13]  <saladofstones> (I don't think Hibiki would know that she does or doesn't)
[09-Feb-2014 01:20:18]  <Rig> "What was Sanae doing here?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:20:51]  <Rig> (Did that get answered last time?)
[09-Feb-2014 01:21:08]  <IllFlower> Yeah, she lives nearby and for all intents and purposes was out for a walk.
[09-Feb-2014 01:21:28]  <IllFlower> Unless you think the torch witch goes after those with boyfriends?
[09-Feb-2014 01:21:35]  <IllFlower> Would be kinda funny, that.
[09-Feb-2014 01:21:36]  <Rig> Yeah.
[09-Feb-2014 01:21:41]  <Rig> That was where I was going.
[09-Feb-2014 01:21:41]  <ponicalica> Yeah, I think that's the idea
[09-Feb-2014 01:21:55]  <IllFlower> No, it's not quite that.
[09-Feb-2014 01:22:04]  <saladofstones> (would we know what though?)
[09-Feb-2014 01:22:33]  <Rig> "Wakahisa, who sent you here, by the way?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:22:47]  *** MobileAvenue <~CentralAv@cpe-65-24-227-116.insight.res.rr.com> has quit IRC (Quit: right lane ends; merge left)
[09-Feb-2014 01:23:11]  <IllFlower> I'd rather avoid sending you guys chasing after red herrings, so I'll just be upfront about it.
[09-Feb-2014 01:23:46]  <saladofstones> "A committee that wasoverseeing the area, wantedan outsider. Also a good way to--anyways do you think we should stay here?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:23:51]  <Rig> Yeah, I'm kind of hitting a dead end on what to do next. I was gonna suggest heading to the library to see if we could pull anything about hand torches.
[09-Feb-2014 01:24:31]  <Rig> Of course, we could always go to the school and see if anything is up there.
[09-Feb-2014 01:24:40]  <saladofstones> I'd say the library is best
[09-Feb-2014 01:25:02]  <saladofstones> it seems like the best way to look up about the torch and I don't know if the school would have anything relevant to our interests
[09-Feb-2014 01:25:20]  <ponicalica> Yeah, I think the library might be a good plan, if they have information on witch symbolism &c.
[09-Feb-2014 01:25:29]  <Rig> "Ayako, you said the torches are witch-hunting imagery, right? Do you think the Conservator Library would have anything useful on that kind of thng?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:25:51]  <saladofstones> perks up at witch-hunters, "Ii think we should be careful though"
[09-Feb-2014 01:26:11]  <saladofstones> "if only sanae had the sense to leave a dying message or something"
[09-Feb-2014 01:26:35]  <saladofstones> "anyways, the people who did this might be watching here right?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:27:16]  <IllFlower> On the other hand, they'd probably have tried to get the jump on the girls by now.
[09-Feb-2014 01:27:45]  <Rig> Jun glances at Wakahisa. She was the only one here when they'd arrived. Maybe she was the one who was watching. Shii mentioned a civil war of some sort.
[09-Feb-2014 01:27:46]  <saladofstones> (I'm suggesting we move to a place less likely to get us ambushed)
[09-Feb-2014 01:28:17]  <ponicalica> "It's possible.  Witch symbolism can be a crapshoot at the best of times, but there are some common motifs.  Actually, I think my notebook has at least a little information on the torches-and-pitchforks symbols..."
[09-Feb-2014 01:29:20]  <IllFlower> There are mostly scribbles regarding the Salem witch trials.
[09-Feb-2014 01:30:13]  <Rig> Should we move on or is there anything else to do here?
[09-Feb-2014 01:30:16]  <ponicalica> ("The attacker's a foreigner?!")
[09-Feb-2014 01:30:17]  <IllFlower> It's possible that the symbol originates not from the witch, but from those controlling it.
[09-Feb-2014 01:30:26]  <saladofstones> (Half-japanese, half-bostonian)
[09-Feb-2014 01:30:36]  <saladofstones> "a flower just told me that..."
[09-Feb-2014 01:30:38]  <Rig> IllFlower's entire plan is to promote Japanese nationalism.
[09-Feb-2014 01:31:20]  <Barcode> we could have just watched that one mech anime.
[09-Feb-2014 01:31:22]  <IllFlower> Apparently.
[09-Feb-2014 01:31:37]  <IllFlower> There's nothing else in particular here.
[09-Feb-2014 01:32:11]  <ponicalica> Should we interrogate the boyfriend and get more red herrings?
[09-Feb-2014 01:32:24]  <saladofstones> we should set fire to the shrine to remove evidence
[09-Feb-2014 01:32:42]  <IllFlower> lol, I think asking the boyfriend about things would be even less helpful.
[09-Feb-2014 01:32:47]  <IllFlower> I thought you guys were going to the library?
[09-Feb-2014 01:33:05]  <ponicalica> Yeah, let's go to the library to look for the symbolism.
[09-Feb-2014 01:33:18]  <ponicalica> *symbolic images of subway turnstiles*
[09-Feb-2014 01:33:27]  <IllFlower> Fast forward.
[09-Feb-2014 01:33:41]  <Rig> >>
[09-Feb-2014 01:33:49]  <ponicalica> »
[09-Feb-2014 01:33:50]  <IllFlower> It's already been a long day by the time the girls enter the Library.
[09-Feb-2014 01:34:16]  <IllFlower> The head librarian, as always, greets her new patrons with a courteous nod. "How can I help you?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:34:32]  <ponicalica> "We're looking for information on a symbol: a hand clutching a torch."
[09-Feb-2014 01:35:34]  <IllFlower> "A hand clutching a torch...? Another one, huh?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:36:20]  <ponicalica> "Another...what?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:36:59]  <IllFlower> "You're the third or fourth person to ask me about that. Well, actually, no, that's not strictly true. Most of the ones who came before you were familiars.
[09-Feb-2014 01:37:36]  <ponicalica> "Now I have two questions."
[09-Feb-2014 01:37:39]  <IllFlower> "
[09-Feb-2014 01:37:43]  <ponicalica> ("I shouldn't've used regular expressions.")
[09-Feb-2014 01:38:36]  <IllFlower> /(?:Wh(?:at|y)|How)\?/i
[09-Feb-2014 01:38:59]  <IllFlower> The librarian gives Ayako a puzzled look.
[09-Feb-2014 01:39:00]  <saladofstones> "Are we sure we want to investigate this? afterall if all the familiars are interested in, I'm sure much more uh"
[09-Feb-2014 01:39:05]  <saladofstones> "qualified? people can do this"
[09-Feb-2014 01:39:14]  <ponicalica> "What did the familiars want to know about the symbol?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:39:46]  <Rig> "For someone investigating a girl's death you certainly are dead set on not investigating it, Wakahisa."
[09-Feb-2014 01:41:31]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: "From what they told me, it seemed to have something to do with the initiates they were responsible for. Some sort of group emblem.
[09-Feb-2014 01:41:44]  <IllFlower> "I'll tell them what I told you:
[09-Feb-2014 01:42:02]  <IllFlower> "-- sorry, tell you what I told them:
[09-Feb-2014 01:42:23]  <IllFlower> "The historical antecedents are a mess, which leads me to suspect this is something new."
[09-Feb-2014 01:42:29]  <saladofstones> "Ffine"
[09-Feb-2014 01:43:27]  <ponicalica> "Do you know the names of any initiates you know to be involved?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:44:08]  <saladofstones> (my brain is dying halp)
[09-Feb-2014 01:45:28]  <IllFlower> "They didn't name any names. Whoever it is, they don't operate in the open.
[09-Feb-2014 01:45:53]  <IllFlower> "The symbol is more like... something left in graffiti on a wall.
[09-Feb-2014 01:45:57]  <IllFlower> "A covert show of support."
[09-Feb-2014 01:46:32]  <ponicalica> "Is there any trend to the events?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:46:39]  <IllFlower> "Events?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:46:59]  <ponicalica> "We found the symbolism twice.  Both associated with witch attacks."
[09-Feb-2014 01:47:12]  <IllFlower> The librarian looks somewhat taken aback.
[09-Feb-2014 01:47:18]  <IllFlower> "That's the first I've heard of that."
[09-Feb-2014 01:49:39]  <IllFlower> Apparently everyone is just as shocked as she is.
[09-Feb-2014 01:49:55]  <ponicalica> yeah I don't know where to go from here :V
[09-Feb-2014 01:50:00]  <saladofstones> (brb)
[09-Feb-2014 01:51:40]  <Rig> "Can you tell us which familiars asked you about it?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:52:06]  <ponicalica> (Librarian rattles off a list of names without context.)
[09-Feb-2014 01:52:10]  <IllFlower> "Oh, yes, of course. Just give me a second."
[09-Feb-2014 01:52:24]  <IllFlower> She writes a few names down on a slip of paper, which she hands to Jun.
[09-Feb-2014 01:52:59]  <IllFlower> They all look to be rather abnormally cutesy.
[09-Feb-2014 01:53:17]  <ponicalica> I thought "abnormally cutesy" was common among familiars
[09-Feb-2014 01:53:24]  <IllFlower> thejoke.png
[09-Feb-2014 01:54:43]  <ponicalica> "Are these the same familiars that have been shuffling around initiates recently?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:55:03]  <Rig> Jun scans over the list and fails to recognize any names. She really shouldn't have expected to.
[09-Feb-2014 01:55:21]  <saladofstones> (back, assume I was frozen in fear and bubbling at the eyes)
[09-Feb-2014 01:55:29]  <IllFlower> Rig: The Conservators presumably have a way to track them down.
[09-Feb-2014 01:55:36]  <saladofstones> looks over the names, seeing if she recoqnizes them
[09-Feb-2014 01:55:37]  *** AttObl|GoldenTime is now known as AttObl
[09-Feb-2014 01:55:39]  <Rig> Yeah, I would assume.
[09-Feb-2014 01:55:48]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: "I've been hearing about that. I wouldn't be surprised."
[09-Feb-2014 01:56:28]  <Rig> "One last thing before we go," Jun says. She puts the photo of Sanae on the counter in front of the librarian. "Do you know either of these people?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:56:58]  <IllFlower> The librarian takes the photo and brings it up to her face.
[09-Feb-2014 01:57:22]  <IllFlower> "I know the girl. Miss Tanimura, yes? She was a regular here."
[09-Feb-2014 01:57:32]  <IllFlower> s/was/is/
[09-Feb-2014 01:57:48]  <Rig> "When did you last see her?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:58:00]  <Barcode> (("is???? boy do we have news for you"))
[09-Feb-2014 01:58:06]  <Rig> "And what did she generally do here?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:58:10]  <IllFlower> "Last week, I believe. Is something the matter?"
[09-Feb-2014 01:58:57]  <Rig> Jun pauses.
[09-Feb-2014 01:59:10]  <Rig> She isn't used to being the one delivering this news to people.
[09-Feb-2014 01:59:50]  <IllFlower> ("She's more of the one who tends to get that news.")
[09-Feb-2014 02:00:17]  <Rig> "She was..." Jun's voice fades. "I'm sorry. We'reinvestigatingherdeath."
[09-Feb-2014 02:00:31]  <Rig> Jun doesn't try to meet the librarian's eyes.
[09-Feb-2014 02:01:52]  <IllFlower> The librarian looks down and nods. "I see. I take it the torch has something to do with that, then?"
[09-Feb-2014 02:02:27]  <Rig> "Yes. The symbol was found near where she died."

[09-Feb-2014 02:04:59]  <IllFlower> "I wish you the best of luck."
[09-Feb-2014 02:05:00]  <IllFlower> The librarian falls silent.
[09-Feb-2014 02:05:10]  <Rig> "Thank you for your help."

[09-Feb-2014 02:06:27]  <Barcode> just say she didn't come with the mto the library, maybe.
[09-Feb-2014 02:06:47]  <ponicalica> yet another Conservator got sick tonight
[09-Feb-2014 02:07:08]  <IllFlower> AI takes control of his character.
[09-Feb-2014 02:07:47]  <IllFlower> I have nothing else to say here, so what happens next is up to you guys.
[09-Feb-2014 02:08:02]  <ponicalica> I think the plan is to go interrogate one of the familiars.
[09-Feb-2014 02:08:07]  <Rig> I was thinking we'd find someplace quiet and get ahold of Shii.
[09-Feb-2014 02:08:18]  <Rig> Then use Shii to point us to one of the names on the list.
[09-Feb-2014 02:08:57]  <IllFlower> That works for me.
[09-Feb-2014 02:09:22]  <IllFlower> Shall we go ahead and do that, then?
[09-Feb-2014 02:10:08]  <ponicalica> yeah
[09-Feb-2014 02:10:23]  <Rig> Jun motions for the other girls to follow her. She leads them down into the area where they'd interrogated Kazuto before stopping and calling Shii.
[09-Feb-2014 02:10:25]  <IllFlower> Okay. Give me just a second, I need to take a quick break.
[09-Feb-2014 02:10:41]  <Rig> No problem.
[09-Feb-2014 02:10:53]  <Barcode> Rig: oh, also, remember that fucking mess of a turn-based game i tried to show you a while back? been revising it into something that at least LOOKS more playable.

[09-Feb-2014 02:11:49]  <Barcode> m. better that way, lol.
[09-Feb-2014 02:14:27]  <IllFlower> With a familiar *crack*, Shii appears on a table in front of the girls.
[09-Feb-2014 02:14:37]  <IllFlower> Apparently, she learned how to do this at Hogwarts.
[09-Feb-2014 02:15:04]  <IllFlower> "Hello, Ayako, Jun. Do you have news?"
[09-Feb-2014 02:16:55]  <ponicalica> "We found a symbol by magically checking the scene of Sanae's death.  A hand clutching a torch.  Some other familiars asked about it; we'd like to contact them."
[09-Feb-2014 02:17:36]  <IllFlower> She presumably mentions that it turned up in Akiko's case, too.
[09-Feb-2014 02:18:32]  *** AttObl is now known as AttObl|Teleglitch
[09-Feb-2014 02:18:36]  <IllFlower> "A hand clutching a torch?" Shii nods in contemplation.
[09-Feb-2014 02:19:23]  <IllFlower> "I'll get the word out about that. We can't overlook something like that showing up in multiple attacks. Especially when one of them was fatal."
[09-Feb-2014 02:19:54]  <IllFlower> Jun hands Shii the list of familiars that the librarian gave her.
[09-Feb-2014 02:20:42]  <IllFlower> "Pyunpyun, Asacchi... mm..." she reads aloud softly.
[09-Feb-2014 02:21:06]  <Barcode> lolo.
[09-Feb-2014 02:21:11]  <IllFlower> "Wait, wait a second." Shii looks up at Jun and Ayako, pointing to one of the items on the list with her tail.
[09-Feb-2014 02:21:27]  <IllFlower> Barcode: I only have, like, five names to use for familiars, haha.
[09-Feb-2014 02:21:49]  <Barcode> "beykyu..."
[09-Feb-2014 02:21:51]  <Rig> "A familiar familiar?"
[09-Feb-2014 02:21:56]  <ponicalica> Barcode: Juubey
[09-Feb-2014 02:22:19]  <IllFlower> "Mizu-chin is Sanae Tanimura's familiar."
[09-Feb-2014 02:22:29]  <ponicalica> haven't you used mizu-chin before too
[09-Feb-2014 02:22:33]  <IllFlower> Yes.
[09-Feb-2014 02:27:42]  <IllFlower> "Have you been in contact with him yet?"
[09-Feb-2014 02:27:42]  <Rig> "No." Jun says. "We arrived at the scene and Wakashina was the only one there."
[09-Feb-2014 02:28:45]  <IllFlower> A brief comedy of errors ensues as it's established that Hibiki's last name is Wakahisa, and that she is in fact the girl standing next to the other two.
[09-Feb-2014 02:28:45]  <IllFlower> "In any case," Shii picks up afterward, "it's clear you should talk to him as soon as possible. You won't be able to summon him like you can me, but he's based out of an apartment in the west."
[09-Feb-2014 02:28:45]  <Rig> Excellent.
[09-Feb-2014 02:28:45]  <IllFlower> She gives the girls the necessary directions, of course.
[09-Feb-2014 02:28:45]  <IllFlower> Or at least starts to, before one of them just whips out a smartphone.

[09-Feb-2014 02:33:35]  <ponicalica> Yeah.
[09-Feb-2014 02:35:05]  <ponicalica> You mentioned only having five names for familiars.  Who's the fifth? :P

[09-Feb-2014 02:37:23]  <ponicalica> Hopefully the girls have a monthly pass or whatever
[09-Feb-2014 02:37:36]  <IllFlower> Mizu-chin's quarters are in a fairly traditional suburban apartment complex. The girls draw up to the entrance and knock on the door, which opens by itself.
[09-Feb-2014 02:38:27]  <IllFlower> The interior is quite bare, with just a television and a heated table in the living room.
[09-Feb-2014 02:39:05]  <IllFlower> A taller girl is sitting at the table. She turns to look at Ayako and Jun, and waves.
[09-Feb-2014 02:39:39]  <ponicalica> "I assume you're one of Mizu-chin's initiates?"
[09-Feb-2014 02:40:03]  <IllFlower> A creature resembling a small aquatic animal is opposite the girl. That must be Mizu-chin.

[09-Feb-2014 02:42:08]  <Rig> "We were curious about Sanae Tanimura. She was one of your initiates, right?"

[09-Feb-2014 02:46:14]  <IllFlower> Jun and Ayako take seats around the table. It's a bit awkward trying to figure out where to seat three parties around a four-sided square table, but they manage.
[09-Feb-2014 02:46:37]  <ponicalica> Ayako draws the hand grasping a torch on a blank page of her notebook, and shows it to Mizu-chin.

[09-Feb-2014 02:46:45]  <Barcode> lol
[09-Feb-2014 02:47:18]  <Rig> back
[09-Feb-2014 02:47:24]  <ponicalica> Kaede then goes to stand outside Aoi Iwatani's house, watching.
[09-Feb-2014 02:47:46]  <IllFlower> Pining for her lost love, no doubt.
[09-Feb-2014 02:48:15]  <IllFlower> Actually, Aoi was continuity with the last Magical Burst campaign.
[09-Feb-2014 02:48:19]  <IllFlower> This world is getting complicated.
[09-Feb-2014 02:48:38]  <ponicalica> Wasn't Motoko's last name Iwatani too?
[09-Feb-2014 02:48:48]  <Barcode> itawani
[09-Feb-2014 02:48:58]  <IllFlower> Yeah. Aoi was Motoko's second cousin.
[09-Feb-2014 02:49:52]  <IllFlower> Anyway, anything in particular you want to ask Mizu-chin, or are you just going to dangle the drawing in front of him and hope he figures it out? :p
[09-Feb-2014 02:50:14]  <Barcode> "Who drew this?"
[09-Feb-2014 02:50:45]  <ponicalica> "We found this symbol at the scene of Sanae's death.  Are you familiar with it?"
[09-Feb-2014 02:51:02]  <IllFlower> (Come to think of it, I stole "Mizu-chin" from Xeniera.)
[09-Feb-2014 02:51:30]  <Barcode> shit, xeniera came before spec ops: the line, but now i'm thinking of homura in that setting or something.
[09-Feb-2014 02:51:57]  <ponicalica> Xeniera was born in like 1992, dude
[09-Feb-2014 02:52:01]  <ponicalica> he's a person
[09-Feb-2014 02:52:08]  <ponicalica> you mean PMMM, right?
[09-Feb-2014 02:52:26]  <IllFlower> No, both Xeniera's MB campaign and Spec Ops were set in Dubai.
[09-Feb-2014 02:52:26]  <Barcode> the campaign he ran, i mean.
[09-Feb-2014 02:52:39]  <ponicalica> Oh right, lol
[09-Feb-2014 02:52:45]  <Barcode> my dad finished spec ops and had nothing to say about the campaign. ;~;
[09-Feb-2014 02:53:04]  <Barcode> i had to lay out the things it was talking about for him. which is weird, i thought he'd get it.
[09-Feb-2014 02:53:18]  <Barcode> anyway sorry conitnue
[09-Feb-2014 02:54:04]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Mizu-chin's reaction tells Ayako everything she needs to know, but all the same he also says, "Yes, I am. It's something that's been appearing here and there around my initiates lately."
[09-Feb-2014 02:56:09]  <IllFlower> He ponders for a moment, then continues. "All indications led me to think it was the mark of some club or faction. You said it had something to do with Sanae's death?"
[09-Feb-2014 02:56:50]  <ponicalica> "We did a magical scan.  This symbol appeared.  The symbol also appeared during a previous witch attack we were investigating.  If this is a club or faction, it's become corrupted."
[09-Feb-2014 02:57:12]  <IllFlower> "become"
[09-Feb-2014 02:57:28]  <Rig> "We were told you'd asked about it at the library. How long has it been appearing?"
[09-Feb-2014 02:57:48]  <IllFlower> Mizu-chain shakes his head in disbelief.
[09-Feb-2014 02:57:54]  <IllFlower> s/chain/chin/
[09-Feb-2014 02:57:59]  <ponicalica> MAKKUSU CHAIN
[09-Feb-2014 02:58:20]  <IllFlower> "I've only started seeing it in the past month or so. Whatever it is, it's quite new.
[09-Feb-2014 02:58:36]  <IllFlower> "Which makes the fact that it's already reached this level quite concerning."
[09-Feb-2014 02:59:02]  <ponicalica> "Are there any initiates in particular it's associated with?"
[09-Feb-2014 02:59:11]  <Rig> "Have any of your other initiates been targeted by witches more than usual?"
[09-Feb-2014 03:00:14]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Same answer as before, about operating in the shadows.
[09-Feb-2014 03:00:51]  <IllFlower> Rig: Not to his knowledge.
[09-Feb-2014 03:01:01]  <IllFlower> Give me a second to sort things out, there's more that needs to be said.
[09-Feb-2014 03:01:06]  <Rig> No problem.
[09-Feb-2014 03:01:13]  <ponicalica> okay
[09-Feb-2014 03:02:44]  <IllFlower> "I can tell you where I've seen that symbol most frequently, though.
[09-Feb-2014 03:03:17]  <IllFlower> "There's a pattern of it being concentrated around schools.
[09-Feb-2014 03:03:42]  <IllFlower> "You mentioned it showed up at the scene of Sanae's death?
[09-Feb-2014 03:03:52]  <Rig> "Yes, at a shrine."
[09-Feb-2014 03:03:57]  <IllFlower> "I've seen it more than a few times around her school in particular."
[09-Feb-2014 03:04:09]  <IllFlower> Mizu-chin looks aside for a moment.
[09-Feb-2014 03:04:24]  *** AttObl|Teleglitch is now known as AttObl
[09-Feb-2014 03:04:27]  <IllFlower> "One of my other charges attends the same school."
[09-Feb-2014 03:04:38]  <IllFlower> He ducks his head underneath the table and pulls out a photograph.
[09-Feb-2014 03:05:20]  <IllFlower> It's of a girl with long black hair, with a young-looking face.
[09-Feb-2014 03:06:01]  <IllFlower> "Her name's Minami Tsuchida. She only came into my care recently."
[09-Feb-2014 03:06:12]  <ponicalica> "Transferred from another initiate?"
[09-Feb-2014 03:06:17]  <IllFlower> It's obvious Mizu-chin's trying not to jump too hastily to conclusions.
[09-Feb-2014 03:06:33]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: s/initiate/familiar/ "Yes. About three months ago."
[09-Feb-2014 03:06:43]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: yeah, make that replacement :V
[09-Feb-2014 03:07:13]  <ponicalica> "Can you tell us more about Minami?"
[09-Feb-2014 03:08:23]  <IllFlower> ("How does that make you feel?")
[09-Feb-2014 03:09:15]  <ponicalica> yeah that was a shitty question
[09-Feb-2014 03:09:28]  <IllFlower> Mizu-chin stutters. "I-- I don't know. Definitely not the kind who would be associated with something like this, in my mind."
[09-Feb-2014 03:12:02]  <Rig> "Would you mind if we talked to her?"
[09-Feb-2014 03:12:41]  <IllFlower> Sounds awfully polite for a possible suspect, haha.
[09-Feb-2014 03:14:58]  <IllFlower> I expected you'd be more confrontational.
[09-Feb-2014 03:15:00]  <Rig> Hitomi would have cracked her knuckles at the appropriate point.
[09-Feb-2014 03:15:08]  <IllFlower> Of course.
[09-Feb-2014 03:15:13]  <Rig> Well, Mizu-chin is cooperating well enough.
[09-Feb-2014 03:15:27]  <IllFlower> Oh, no, with Minami.
[09-Feb-2014 03:15:35]  *** Arisaka is now known as JBridge
[09-Feb-2014 03:15:43]  <ponicalica> Well we haven't started talking to her yet.
[09-Feb-2014 03:16:05]  <IllFlower> Something more like "Can you tell us where she is?" I mean.
[09-Feb-2014 03:16:10]  <IllFlower> But anyway,
[09-Feb-2014 03:16:26]  <IllFlower> "No, of course not. I'm surprised you're even asking.
[09-Feb-2014 03:16:54]  <IllFlower> "You'd probably have the best luck looking for her at school.
[09-Feb-2014 03:17:07]  <IllFlower> "I have her home address as well, but I imagine that'd be more likely to cause a scene."
[09-Feb-2014 03:17:22]  <Rig> "Yes, we've had some experience with that today."
[09-Feb-2014 03:18:00]  <ponicalica> It's time for another school infiltration?
[09-Feb-2014 03:18:05]  <Rig> Jun starts to stand up, but stops as she remembers one detail. "Did Sanae have a boyfriend at school?"
[09-Feb-2014 03:20:27]  <IllFlower> "Yes, she did. I think his name was Noguchi? She talked about him every once in a while. They only started seeing each other recently, though. Sometime within the past two months."
[09-Feb-2014 03:21:34]  <ponicalica> "Did Minami know Noguchi?"
[09-Feb-2014 03:22:20]  <IllFlower> "It wouldn't surprise me. She's a couple of years younger than the two of them, but she does still attend the same school."
[09-Feb-2014 03:26:26]  <Rig> "I think we've got enough information to proceed."
[09-Feb-2014 03:27:32]  <ponicalica> Man, this entire session has basically been chasing people to get them to talk about other ones, lol
[09-Feb-2014 03:27:55]  <Barcode> illflower's been playing too much LA Noire.
[09-Feb-2014 03:28:24]  <IllFlower> This session hasn't exactly gone the way I thought it was going to, haha.
[09-Feb-2014 03:28:47]  <IllFlower> So, what's the plan?
[09-Feb-2014 03:28:50]  <Rig> Does it ever go the way you think?
[09-Feb-2014 03:29:28]  <IllFlower> The one where you guys fought Kotomi went pretty much according to my expectations.
[09-Feb-2014 03:29:33]  <ponicalica> My first instinct is to talk to Minami but these conversations have felt a bit blood-from-a-stone-y.
[09-Feb-2014 03:29:36]  <IllFlower> Lots of destruction, lots of fallout.
[09-Feb-2014 03:29:51]  <Rig> I'm not sure where else we could go.
[09-Feb-2014 03:30:45]  <IllFlower> Well, maybe this time you can extract blood from a human instead.
[09-Feb-2014 03:31:25]  <ponicalica> Then yeah, let's head to Minami.
[09-Feb-2014 03:31:39]  * Rig presses X to Jason.
[09-Feb-2014 03:32:06]  <IllFlower> How would you guys like to play this?
[09-Feb-2014 03:32:36]  <IllFlower> You can go for direct confrontation, you can try and surveil, you can stand on a box in the courtyard and challenge her to magical combat...
[09-Feb-2014 03:33:00]  <ponicalica> What do you think, Rig?
[09-Feb-2014 03:33:07]  <Rig> I'd like to go direct.
[09-Feb-2014 03:33:16]  <Rig> Kick in her teeth. Play some bad cop, nerdy cop.
[09-Feb-2014 03:33:33]  <Rig> Kidding about the last bit.
[09-Feb-2014 03:34:16]  <IllFlower> The Hitomi strategy.
[09-Feb-2014 03:34:16]  <ponicalica> well it is a pretty accurate summation of Ayako
[09-Feb-2014 03:34:55]  <Rig> So, Jun and Ayako thank Mixu-chain.
[09-Feb-2014 03:35:07]  <Rig> And head out.
[09-Feb-2014 03:35:12]  <IllFlower> Done.
[09-Feb-2014 03:35:24]  <IllFlower> Any situation you'd like to set up?
[09-Feb-2014 03:35:43]  <IllFlower> We can always have you corner her in an empty classroom or something.
[09-Feb-2014 03:36:46]  <Rig> Yeah, that seems reasonable.
[09-Feb-2014 03:36:54]  <Rig> Want me to set it up? Or should you?
[09-Feb-2014 03:37:35]  <IllFlower> It seems like you have a good idea of the scene already.
[09-Feb-2014 03:37:57]  <IllFlower> If that's the case, she's all yours.
[09-Feb-2014 03:38:10]  <Rig> Okay. What time-ish is it when we arrive?
[09-Feb-2014 03:39:13]  <IllFlower> If you go right after talking to Mizu-chin, it's probably about sundown.
[09-Feb-2014 03:39:26]  <ponicalica> Nice and atmospheric.
[09-Feb-2014 03:40:10]  <IllFlower> You could always fake a PA announcement.
[09-Feb-2014 03:41:16]  <ponicalica> So like "Minami Tsuchida, please come to room 2916"?
[09-Feb-2014 03:41:18]  <IllFlower> Get her to report to the otherwise deserted classroom 1-3 or something.
[09-Feb-2014 03:41:42]  <Rig> Jun and Ayako arrive at the school. It's late in the day and most of the students are just finishing up club meetings. Jun stops the first student they see. "Can you tell us where Minami Tsuchida is?" Luckily, the boy knows her and points them towards one of the art classes. "Ayako, you can probably pass for an aide. Go in and tell her she's needed in..." Jun looks in a nearby classroom. Empty. "1-3."
[09-Feb-2014 03:42:13]  <IllFlower> Smooth operator, Jun is.
[09-Feb-2014 03:42:38]  <Rig> She knows how clubs work.
[09-Feb-2014 03:42:53]  <Rig> Eesh, PiratePad is always down.
[09-Feb-2014 03:43:09]  <IllFlower> Ayako opens the door to the art classroom to find a handful of students working on various projects.
[09-Feb-2014 03:43:27]  <IllFlower> She spots Minami painting a very abstract piece in a corner near the window.
[09-Feb-2014 03:43:36]  <ponicalica> Is it a hand with a torch?
[09-Feb-2014 03:43:40]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yeah, I moved the character sheets.
[09-Feb-2014 03:43:42]  <IllFlower> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AizHQ9KT342udEN1Q0ZxT1liX0FyVDdVRkNSdXcxc1E

[09-Feb-2014 03:44:09]  <IllFlower> The long descriptions aren't on there, but they're on the character sheet snapshots in the log directory.
[09-Feb-2014 03:44:19]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Ha, no, that'd be way too obvious.
[09-Feb-2014 03:45:03]  <ponicalica> "Miss Tsuchida, (some teacher's name she pulled from the directory) needs to speak to you in room 1-3."
[09-Feb-2014 03:45:57]  <IllFlower> Minami turns her head to look at Ayako.
[09-Feb-2014 03:46:12]  <IllFlower> "1-3? That's odd...
[09-Feb-2014 03:47:10]  <IllFlower> "Akane?" she asks one of her classmates. "Can you look after the paints? I'll be right back."
[09-Feb-2014 03:47:37]  <IllFlower> In spite of her confusion, Minami follows Ayako down to 1-3, as requested.
[09-Feb-2014 03:48:11]  <IllFlower> She opens the door to find not the teacher, of course, but Jun.
[09-Feb-2014 03:48:35]  <IllFlower> Ayako walks up and closes the door behind the two of them, blocking one of the room's exits.
[09-Feb-2014 03:48:51]  <IllFlower> "Who are you?" Minami asks.
[09-Feb-2014 03:49:49]  <Rig> Jun holds her palm and the Convservator's seal glows on her hand briefly.
[09-Feb-2014 03:50:01]  <Rig> "Mizu-chin told us where to find you. We need to talk."
[09-Feb-2014 03:50:27]  <IllFlower> The fading sunlight casts long shadows across the room. Looks like the windows here face west.
[09-Feb-2014 03:50:48]  <IllFlower> "I have nothing to discuss with you," Minami says, quite bluntly.
[09-Feb-2014 03:51:57]  <Rig> Jun leans against a desk and crosses her arms. "You don't have much choice in the matter."
[09-Feb-2014 03:52:14]  <Rig> "You know Sanae was murdered earlier today, don't you?"
[09-Feb-2014 03:52:56]  <IllFlower> Minami throws glances across the room, to the windows and the one remaining unguarded door.
[09-Feb-2014 03:53:08]  <IllFlower> "I do."
[09-Feb-2014 03:53:27]  <Rig> "Do you know why she was murdered?"
[09-Feb-2014 03:53:46]  <IllFlower> "I do."
[09-Feb-2014 03:54:25]  <Rig> Jun crosses the room so the setting sun is behind her. Her shadow falls across Minami. "Tell me."
[09-Feb-2014 03:55:21]  <IllFlower> "Two more and there would have been a reward."
[09-Feb-2014 03:56:07]  <IllFlower> Minami laughs a humorless, mirthless laugh.
[09-Feb-2014 03:56:07]  <ponicalica> well shit
[09-Feb-2014 03:56:32]  <IllFlower> "You have no idea what you're in the middle of, do you?"
[09-Feb-2014 03:56:57]  <Rig> Jun advances on the girl. "No, but I don't think you know who I am."
[09-Feb-2014 03:57:15]  <IllFlower> "All are equal in death."
[09-Feb-2014 03:57:17]  <Rig> I'd like to initiate a conflict.
[09-Feb-2014 03:57:23]  <IllFlower> Much obliged.
[09-Feb-2014 03:57:27]  <IllFlower> What are the stakes?
[09-Feb-2014 03:57:30]  <Rig> The stakes are that Jun beats the answers out of Minami.
[09-Feb-2014 03:57:37]  <IllFlower> Which answers?
[09-Feb-2014 03:57:48]  <ponicalica> Who she's working for and why, I'm thinking.
[09-Feb-2014 03:57:51]  <Rig> Why she ambushed/killed Sanae.
[09-Feb-2014 03:57:59]  <Rig> Or who asked her to.
[09-Feb-2014 03:58:04]  <IllFlower> I can do that.
[09-Feb-2014 03:58:14]  <IllFlower> Give me a moment to make a new character.
[09-Feb-2014 03:58:17]  <Rig> Okay.
[09-Feb-2014 03:58:20]  <IllFlower> Starting venue?
[09-Feb-2014 03:58:25]  <Rig> Physical.
[09-Feb-2014 03:58:26]  <ponicalica> Should Ayako be involved here too?
[09-Feb-2014 03:58:36]  <Rig> She doesn't have to be.
[09-Feb-2014 03:58:46]  <Rig> In fact, I'd be okay with Ayako standing back while Jun goes to town.
[09-Feb-2014 03:59:16]  <IllFlower> Physical hand-to-hand or no?
[09-Feb-2014 03:59:17]  <ponicalica> Yeah, it might make more sense that she stands back and only gets involved(as a tool if I'm reading the rules right) if she makes a run for it, etc.
[09-Feb-2014 03:59:21]  <Rig> Hand to hand.

[09-Feb-2014 04:25:17]  <ponicalica> Ayako entered the conflict with the relationship die is what happened, I think; anything else would be a follow-up.
[09-Feb-2014 04:26:04]  <IllFlower> Yeah, she would have had to have joined at the beginning in order to be a full participant.

[09-Feb-2014 04:31:13]  <Rig> Gonna add a d4 to Jun's Takeshi relationship.
[09-Feb-2014 04:31:24]  <IllFlower> 4d4?

[09-Feb-2014 04:31:40]  <Rig> Dishonoring his memory.
[09-Feb-2014 04:31:53]  <ponicalica> The killer of Sanae, who had a boyfriend, etc
[09-Feb-2014 04:32:00]  <IllFlower> She's taking it hard, man.
[09-Feb-2014 04:32:11]  <IllFlower> What else?
[09-Feb-2014 04:32:59]  <Rig> I wanna reflect that she got hurt fighting. So a 1d4 trait involving injury?
[09-Feb-2014 04:33:21]  <Rig> Or maybe drop one from Bd.
[09-Feb-2014 04:33:31]  <IllFlower> I'd say the latter.
[09-Feb-2014 04:33:45]  <IllFlower> Since being hurt isn't exactly a voluntary roll.
[09-Feb-2014 04:34:04]  <Rig> Yeah.

[09-Feb-2014 04:35:15]  <Rig> Jun is shit at not getting hurt.
[09-Feb-2014 04:35:28]  <IllFlower> Minami stands up, looking down at Jun's crumpled form.
[09-Feb-2014 04:36:15]  <Barcode> heh, shit, couldn't ayako start a megukal conflict as a followup
[09-Feb-2014 04:36:17]  <IllFlower> Hm, I'm wondering if I shouldn't have Minami try to kill Ayako or something.
[09-Feb-2014 04:36:30]  <Barcode> IllFlower: mind the stakes and all that.
[09-Feb-2014 04:36:36]  <Barcode> stakes system*
[09-Feb-2014 04:37:08]  <Rig> Good, Never Forget came on Spotify.
[09-Feb-2014 04:37:12]  <IllFlower> I think that's actually legit, but it seems a bit drastically cruel even for Minami.
[09-Feb-2014 04:37:22]  <Rig> Well, she is vicious.
[09-Feb-2014 04:37:38]  <IllFlower> "Oh, you're incapacitated? Let me just kill your friend in front of your eyes!"
[09-Feb-2014 04:37:51]  <Barcode> oh, it makes sense, it just means ponny has no reason to Give, is all.
[09-Feb-2014 04:37:51]  <Rig> That's a bit drastic actually.
[09-Feb-2014 04:38:03]  <Barcode> since he might as well just fight through any and all Fallouts.
[09-Feb-2014 04:38:08]  <ponicalica> Barcode: nah, there's still the possibility of worse fallouts
[09-Feb-2014 04:38:13]  <IllFlower> Than dying?
[09-Feb-2014 04:38:23]  <ponicalica> The stakes are four dice when death is on the line
[09-Feb-2014 04:38:40]  <IllFlower> Oh, right, *everyone* dying.
[09-Feb-2014 04:39:05]  <Rig> i think it'd make sense for Minami to try to bolt now.
[09-Feb-2014 04:39:28]  <ponicalica> Ayako stares at Minami and Jun, unsure as to whether she should stop her now or try to just keep her from bolting.
[09-Feb-2014 04:39:38]  <Barcode> is minami not hurt at all
[09-Feb-2014 04:39:42]  <Barcode> re leg pop
[09-Feb-2014 04:39:47]  <Rig> Or Ayako could initiate a conflict to stop her.
[09-Feb-2014 04:39:58]  <Rig> Yeah, she has 3d6 fallout to take, I think.
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:05]  <ponicalica> 3d8
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:08]  <IllFlower> Those stakes would be too similar to the previous, I think.
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:12]  <Rig> d6 from Jun.
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:14]  <IllFlower> No, it's 3d6 on her side.
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:18]  <ponicalica> oh, okay
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:18]  <IllFlower> @dice roll 3d6
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:18]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 1 4 6 = 11.
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:23]  <Barcode> 1,1,1. the pop was just cracking her joint, like you'd crack your knuckle.
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:30]  <IllFlower> 10.
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:37]  <Rig> So 1 long term.
[09-Feb-2014 04:40:44]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[09-Feb-2014 04:41:15]  <IllFlower> Since it was a physical injury I think it's only fair that I mirror Rig and bump Bd down from 4 to 3.
[09-Feb-2014 04:41:26]  <Rig> Works for me.
[09-Feb-2014 04:41:41]  <Rig> Damn, those magic stats are out of this world.
[09-Feb-2014 04:43:11]  <IllFlower> Yeah, had you escalated things would have gotten ugly fast.
[09-Feb-2014 04:43:33]  <Rig> Yeah, I didn't even look. It just didn't make sense to escalate.
[09-Feb-2014 04:45:11]  <ponicalica> Or maybe we should tail Minami, see where she runs when she does?
[09-Feb-2014 04:45:55]  <ponicalica> And then gather for a more decisive confrontation when we have Hi{bik|kar}i
[09-Feb-2014 04:45:57]  <IllFlower> That might not be a bad idea.
[09-Feb-2014 04:46:11]  <IllFlower> The stakes are different enough that I think it'd work.
[09-Feb-2014 04:47:19]  <Rig> I like that.
[09-Feb-2014 04:47:28]  <ponicalica> Is Jun physically capable in that regards?
[09-Feb-2014 04:47:50]  <IllFlower> I'm split on that.
[09-Feb-2014 04:47:56]  <Rig> I don't think so.
[09-Feb-2014 04:47:57]  <IllFlower> She did take the appropriate fallout.
[09-Feb-2014 04:48:51]  <IllFlower> Okay, so we'll just run with Ayako, then?
[09-Feb-2014 04:49:22]  <IllFlower> You're in luck, actually, Bd+Ht for a physical conflict are exactly equal, haha.
[09-Feb-2014 04:49:47]  <ponicalica> haha
[09-Feb-2014 04:51:38]  <IllFlower> Do you want to go ahead with that, ponicalica?
[09-Feb-2014 04:52:15]  <ponicalica> Yeah.  Maybe establish the stakes a little more clearly beforehand, but yeah
[09-Feb-2014 04:52:44]  <IllFlower> Whether Minami manages to lose Ayako, I'd say.
[09-Feb-2014 04:53:14]  <IllFlower> If Minami loses, Ayako will figure out where she's going, undetected.
[09-Feb-2014 04:53:53]  <ponicalica> Alright.
[09-Feb-2014 04:54:08]  <IllFlower> With that, I think Minami should raise first.

[09-Feb-2014 05:03:57]  <IllFlower> You just have to keep her in your sights for sees, I think.
[09-Feb-2014 05:04:43]  <IllFlower> Oh, there's actually a sample tailing scenario on page 88.
[09-Feb-2014 05:04:51]  <ponicalica> Hmm, maybe something like finding a route that keeps her just out of reach of a fleeing Minami but then how would you/she See that?  oh, lol, let's check page 88

[09-Feb-2014 05:05:46]  <ponicalica> Wait, 88?
[09-Feb-2014 05:06:01]  <ponicalica> oh, wait, yeah
[09-Feb-2014 05:06:03]  <IllFlower> Yeah, at the top.

[09-Feb-2014 05:07:55]  <IllFlower> The raises are going to be fairly indirect on your end, I suppose.
[09-Feb-2014 05:08:12]  <ponicalica> hmmm, yeah, I'm thinking something like she sees a map of the school and figures out the only way she can actually exit
[09-Feb-2014 05:08:21]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that's not a bad one.
[09-Feb-2014 05:08:28]  <IllFlower> Take a shortcut.
[09-Feb-2014 05:08:59]  <IllFlower> They're on the third floor and there's only one stairwell in the direction she ran.
[09-Feb-2014 05:10:23]  <IllFlower> Oh, I assume she says some parting words to Jun. Maybe calls Shii over or something.
[09-Feb-2014 05:10:58]  <IllFlower> Can't just leave her comrade lying on the floor in some school.
[09-Feb-2014 05:11:03]  <ponicalica> Of course.
[09-Feb-2014 05:11:08]  <ponicalica> I don't think that's a Raise though.
[09-Feb-2014 05:11:28]  <IllFlower> Oh, yeah, no, the raise would be the shortcut or whatever.
[09-Feb-2014 05:12:05]  <IllFlower> Or maybe some misdirection. Make a huge racket elsewhere.
[09-Feb-2014 05:12:17]  <IllFlower> Make Minami think Ayako went *that* way.
[09-Feb-2014 05:12:41]  <ponicalica> reminds me of Jun in the hospital room, that does
[09-Feb-2014 05:13:02]  <IllFlower> Birds of a feather.
[09-Feb-2014 05:15:07]  <ponicalica> Ayako sees the map of the school and the direction Minami fled in, noticing the single stairwell she'd have to take.  Ayako notices another stairwell nearby that will let her keep up with Minami without her noticing.
[09-Feb-2014 05:15:38]  <ponicalica> now the question is how strong of a Raise actually is that :P
[09-Feb-2014 05:16:25]  *** Nitya <~Glossina@gannon-wless-gw.resnet.wsu.edu> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 186 seconds)
[09-Feb-2014 05:16:36]  <IllFlower> Pick a number, any number.
[09-Feb-2014 05:16:45]  <ponicalica> @dice use 4 6
[09-Feb-2014 05:16:45]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Used 4 6 = 10. Bank now has 1 2 6 6 = 15.

[09-Feb-2014 05:16:50]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Bank has 1 2 2 3 5 6 6 = 25.
[09-Feb-2014 05:18:36]  <IllFlower> Minami realizes her mistake when she reaches the bottom floor. She tries climbing out of a window to give Ayako the slip, but takes a bit of a tumble on landing.
[09-Feb-2014 05:18:40]  <IllFlower> @dice use 2 3 5
[09-Feb-2014 05:18:40]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 2 3 5 = 10. Bank now has 1 2 6 6 = 15.
[09-Feb-2014 05:18:50]  <IllFlower> 3d6 fallout.
[09-Feb-2014 05:19:10]  <IllFlower> Aaaand we are now exactly even. Wow.
[09-Feb-2014 05:19:38]  <IllFlower> Maybe I shouldn't have used that 3.
[09-Feb-2014 05:19:39]  <Barcode> oh, i thought she had jumped out of the third story window
[09-Feb-2014 05:20:21]  <IllFlower> Hm, actually, if we play this to its logical conclusion, I lose.
[09-Feb-2014 05:20:47]  <IllFlower> My raise, your see, your raise, my see, then we're out of dice and it's my raise.
[09-Feb-2014 05:21:23]  <IllFlower> I don't feel like escalating this so I'm going to cut my losses and give, keeping 6.
[09-Feb-2014 05:22:08]  <ponicalica> Alright.  So I suppose Ayako tails Minami undetected?
[09-Feb-2014 05:22:11]  *** Alicia <~alicia@wl-s191-63.resnet.ucla.edu> has quit IRC (Quit: Lost terminal)
[09-Feb-2014 05:22:13]  <IllFlower> Minami just includes the possibility that the Conservators are on her in her calculations, I guess.
[09-Feb-2014 05:22:35]  <IllFlower> Yeah, she doesn't *know* that Ayako's on her, but she compensates with additional paranoia or something.
[09-Feb-2014 05:22:59]  *** Alicia <~alicia@wl-s191-63.resnet.ucla.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[09-Feb-2014 05:23:14]  <ponicalica> It's not like the Conservators and their attitudes towards false doctrine etc. aren't unknown in the magical community
[09-Feb-2014 05:23:38]  <Alicia> Are you still conserving.
[09-Feb-2014 05:24:06]  <Rig> I think we're gonna wrap up soon.
[09-Feb-2014 05:24:26]  <Alicia> (Okay, thanks. Sorry, I lost connection so I wasn't sure.)
[09-Feb-2014 05:25:41]  <IllFlower> Yeah, I think this may actually be a good place to stop.
[09-Feb-2014 05:25:52]  <Rig> Thoughts on the session?>
[09-Feb-2014 05:25:56]  <IllFlower> It's been almost five and a half hours, haha.
[09-Feb-2014 05:26:07]  <Rig> It was a long one.
[09-Feb-2014 05:26:08]  <ponicalica> yeah, I should probably get me some food
[09-Feb-2014 05:26:10]  <IllFlower> Well, we actually had conflict this time, which was an improvement.
[09-Feb-2014 05:26:12]  <ponicalica> And yeah, it was a long session
[09-Feb-2014 05:26:16]  <Rig> We could try doing this over Skype.
[09-Feb-2014 05:26:30]  <ponicalica> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
[09-Feb-2014 05:26:41]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[09-Feb-2014 05:26:43]  <Rig> It would speed things up by a huge amount.
[09-Feb-2014 05:27:03]  <IllFlower> Is that "eeeeeeh" as in "wat" or "eeeeeeh" as in "I dunno about that..."?
[09-Feb-2014 05:27:09]  <Rig> Latter.
[09-Feb-2014 05:27:19]  <ponicalica> it's "eeeeeeeeeeeeh" as in "I'm not a fan of Skype".
[09-Feb-2014 05:27:33]  <Alicia> Same (even though I wasn't here).
[09-Feb-2014 05:27:40]  <IllFlower> Maybe a better description of the former would be "classroom full of incredulous Japanese schoolchildren."
[09-Feb-2014 05:28:28]  <ponicalica> "eeeeeeeh maji?  EASY MODO blah blah blah apparently this dumb meme was based on a dōjin comic where women mock a dude for being a virgin"
[09-Feb-2014 05:28:35]  <IllFlower> I think that's something we can hash out later.
[09-Feb-2014 05:29:00]  <Rig> Well, I enjoyed this session.
[09-Feb-2014 05:29:05]  <Rig> Even though we went off the rails for a while.
[09-Feb-2014 05:29:10]  <Rig> And it took forever.
[09-Feb-2014 05:29:15]  <Rig> But that's par for the course.
[09-Feb-2014 05:29:17]  <IllFlower> I'm not opposed to it. Maybe we can use Hangouts or something if Skype's a problem.
[09-Feb-2014 05:29:54]  <IllFlower> Pretty sure half of you guys are using Google's browser already anyway. :p
[09-Feb-2014 05:30:17]  <IllFlower> Rig: Good to hear you liked it.
[09-Feb-2014 05:30:28]  <IllFlower> Thanks again for playing, all of you.
[09-Feb-2014 05:30:29]  <Rig> Hopefully it wasn't awful for you.
[09-Feb-2014 05:30:30]  <ponicalica> Hangouts would solve the "Skype freezes up on me" problem though my general dislike of voice/video chat would still exist.
[09-Feb-2014 05:30:35]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Thanks for GMing.
[09-Feb-2014 05:30:38]  <IllFlower> We'll be back at some point sometime.
