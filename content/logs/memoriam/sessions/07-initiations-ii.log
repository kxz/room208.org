[05-Jan-2014 20:17:24]  <IllFlower> okay, so we're midway through getting traits down.
[05-Jan-2014 20:17:36]  <Alicia> I think mine were already done.
[05-Jan-2014 20:18:33]  *** Saladofstones <~Saladofst@pool-173-51-83-42.lsanca.fios.verizon.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Rosemary, heaven restore you in light.)
[05-Jan-2014 20:18:38]  <Rig> Yeah, Alicia's character is solid enough.
[05-Jan-2014 20:18:47]  *** Saladofstones <~Saladofst@pool-173-51-83-42.lsanca.fios.verizon.net> has joined #madokamadness
[05-Jan-2014 20:18:48]  <ponicalica> ...and saladofstones just disappeared. V
[05-Jan-2014 20:18:54]  <ponicalica> there we go
[05-Jan-2014 20:18:55]  <Saladofstones> I returned
[05-Jan-2014 20:18:59]  <Saladofstones> It closed
[05-Jan-2014 20:19:27]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@181.135.143.31> has joined #madokamadness
[05-Jan-2014 20:19:50]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Magical Dogs character creation | Xeniera is planning FF:Eva
[05-Jan-2014 20:19:59]  <Rig> Okay, so we were at the point where we had a tenured Soviet History professor as a magical girl.
[05-Jan-2014 20:20:50]  <IllFlower> yeah, we need to retool Hibiki's traits.
[05-Jan-2014 20:21:28]  <Alicia> Become magical girl for Motherland.
[05-Jan-2014 20:21:38]  <Saladofstones> okay 
[05-Jan-2014 20:21:43]  <Saladofstones> I need a link to the character sheet
[05-Jan-2014 20:21:56]  <IllFlower> I think we can keep some element of her inherent "political" distrust of others, and her independent streak.
[05-Jan-2014 20:22:04]  <IllFlower> http://piratepad.net/1RS1pZjAtn # it's also linked from the wiki page.
[05-Jan-2014 20:22:05]  <Omnipresence> 14URL: [piratepad.net] PiratePad: 1RS1pZjAtn
[05-Jan-2014 20:22:37]  <Saladofstones> yeah I was thinknig over it
[05-Jan-2014 20:23:56]  <Saladofstones> I'm not sure how much the penal element needs to stay, but I would like to have the idea of her being someone who thinks of herself as a good political person who got fucked over by politics but doesn't want to give up her position
[05-Jan-2014 20:24:54]  <Alicia> God I think it's finally quiet enough. @_@
[05-Jan-2014 20:25:53]  <Rig> Okay, so, Hibiki is proud?
[05-Jan-2014 20:26:13]  <IllFlower> well, there's a good tension there, between her principles (that say "no, I know I'm innocent") and her own personal pride (that says "but if I stand up I'm going to get knocked down a peg").
[05-Jan-2014 20:26:14]  <Nitya> who wouldn't be proud of an in-depth knowledge of soviet hisotyr
[05-Jan-2014 20:26:31]  <Saladofstones> I would be
[05-Jan-2014 20:28:10]  <IllFlower> there's something in there about enjoying her status and her sense of independence.
[05-Jan-2014 20:28:25]  <Rig> Okay, so, independent, proud, enjoys status.
[05-Jan-2014 20:28:50]  <IllFlower> "haughty 2d6" ;)
[05-Jan-2014 20:28:55]  <Rig> Yeah.
[05-Jan-2014 20:28:58]  <Saladofstones> "is a tsundere"
[05-Jan-2014 20:29:03]  <Rig> I was gonna say "enjoys the high life"
[05-Jan-2014 20:29:58]  <ponicalica> meguca life
[05-Jan-2014 20:29:59]  <Rig> Okay, now, she took a fall for some reason.
[05-Jan-2014 20:30:44]  <Saladofstones> two factions are having conflict in the Osaka region, someone other than Hibiki causes an incident that is indirectly tied back to her. She's innocent, but its in the interest of everyone to minimize attention and damage, so s he's the fall guy
[05-Jan-2014 20:31:00]  <Saladofstones> her conflict is that she didn't do it, but knew that she didn't have the pull to do anything and was given a good offer to take the hit
[05-Jan-2014 20:31:21]  <SpruceZeus> jseblan: Up for a quick game of magic?
[05-Jan-2014 20:31:30]  <jseblan> yes
[05-Jan-2014 20:31:32]  <SpruceZeus> oh right magical dogs shit going on rn sorry
[05-Jan-2014 20:32:25]  <Alicia> Heh.
[05-Jan-2014 20:32:31]  <IllFlower> I could see this being a "take the upstart down a notch" situation. either way, your relationships look fairly workable, flavor text aside.
[05-Jan-2014 20:34:01]  <IllFlower> I wouldn't actually suggest "haughty 2d6" just because I actually used that for an NPC. hence the wink. :p
[05-Jan-2014 20:34:04]  <IllFlower> but the general idea of being proud (and being proud of being a Conservator) works for a trait or two.
[05-Jan-2014 20:34:15]  <Rig> Why not have her betrayal be a trait?
[05-Jan-2014 20:34:34]  <Rig> "was betrayed" "took a fall for her ideals"
[05-Jan-2014 20:34:39]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: I remember you mentioned something about magic being a way to get out of the mundane life where she feels she can't do anything important?
[05-Jan-2014 20:35:14]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: yeah she was pretty aimless, and felt that there wasn't anythings he could do in ordinary life to fulfill her ambitions
[05-Jan-2014 20:35:44]  <Saladofstones> its pretty important since that is why she's conflicted about taking the hit, she did sort of betray herself but the idea of losing megucahood would be worse than death to her
[05-Jan-2014 20:35:50]  <IllFlower> "magic makes my life worth living" etc.
[05-Jan-2014 20:35:51]  <Rig> Also, 2d6 for soviet history puts soviet history as important for her as protecting people is to Jun.
[05-Jan-2014 20:35:59]  <Rig> Which is fine.
[05-Jan-2014 20:36:40]  <Rig> But something to consider.
[05-Jan-2014 20:36:55]  <Saladofstones> I think given her personality, she might like american history more since muh self made man but soviet history, as a culture, does have the idea of a backwards agricultural nation becoming a major political force
[05-Jan-2014 20:39:01]  <IllFlower> it would be something interesting in talky conflicts.
[05-Jan-2014 20:39:22]  <Rig> Yeah, but I don't think it's 2d6 worth of interesting.
[05-Jan-2014 20:39:43]  <IllFlower> yeah, I don't disagree with that.
[05-Jan-2014 20:39:51]  <Saladofstones> I altered it to 3d6 of magic is worth everything
[05-Jan-2014 20:39:58]  <Saladofstones> "    3d6 Better to suffer with magic than to thrive without it"
[05-Jan-2014 20:40:30]  <Saladofstones> I can live a 1d6 for soviet history
[05-Jan-2014 20:40:31]  <Rig> Okay, that's a trait I like. It defines the character and does something to explain why she'd rather be punished than be thrown out entirely.
[05-Jan-2014 20:40:43]  <Rig> And yeah, 1d6 is good for soviet history.
[05-Jan-2014 20:41:09]  <Rig> You really don't need to add flavor text for every trait.
[05-Jan-2014 20:42:24]  <Saladofstones> Yeah I see that, it was making things too complicated
[05-Jan-2014 20:43:02]  <Rig> Okay, so, I still think being proud works as a trait.
[05-Jan-2014 20:43:16]  <Rig> Maybe proud of something in particular. Independence, being a conservator, something like that.
[05-Jan-2014 20:43:35]  <Saladofstones> She's proud of being in a position of authority, in specific, so of being a conservator
[05-Jan-2014 20:43:38]  <Saladofstones> which is why getting demoted sucks
[05-Jan-2014 20:43:51]  <IllFlower> she needs Conservatorship as a trait or relationship anyway, and this sounds like a perfect trait.
[05-Jan-2014 20:44:08]  <Saladofstones> so as a 1d8
[05-Jan-2014 20:44:21]  <Saladofstones> that means is it stronger or weaker than a 2d8 trait?
[05-Jan-2014 20:44:35]  <Rig> It means it's less important.
[05-Jan-2014 20:44:35]  <Saladofstones> >finally get tenyruu
[05-Jan-2014 20:44:39]  <Saladofstones> its glorious
[05-Jan-2014 20:45:17]  <Rig> Basically, big dice size means they draw power from it.
[05-Jan-2014 20:45:19]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[05-Jan-2014 20:45:22]  <Rig> Lots of dice means it's important.
[05-Jan-2014 20:45:33]  <Saladofstones> I'd say its important, but not as important as her having the position at all
[05-Jan-2014 20:45:35]  <Saladofstones> not sure how to fram that
[05-Jan-2014 20:45:52]  <Rig> I think 1d8 is a good starting point for the trait.
[05-Jan-2014 20:47:34]  <IllFlower> if you think about it in terms of the conflict mechanics, both increasing the die size and number of dice will get you a higher total - but the latter means that to get the same total you'll need more dice, which means that your character has to take fallout.
[05-Jan-2014 20:48:14]  <IllFlower> so more dice mean something that your character is willing to defend at high cost to herself; larger dice mean something that your character uses for (offensive) power, like Rig said.
[05-Jan-2014 20:50:59]  <Rig> So, we have a trait for being a Conservator, a trait for caring about magic, a trait for character fluff.
[05-Jan-2014 20:52:12]  <Rig> And I think there is 1d8 and 2d6 left.
[05-Jan-2014 20:52:14]  <Saladofstones> I think there shoudl be something related to her perceptive nature though
[05-Jan-2014 20:53:22]  <Rig> How about just a trait like "an eye for details" or something?
[05-Jan-2014 20:55:30]  <Rig> Okay, that leaves 2d6.
[05-Jan-2014 20:56:44]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[05-Jan-2014 20:58:25]  <Rig> IllFlower: Have any ideas for traits?
[05-Jan-2014 20:58:40]  <IllFlower> hm, let's see...
[05-Jan-2014 20:59:16]  <IllFlower> last time we fell back on elemental affinities, particular likes or dislikes, those sorts of things.
[05-Jan-2014 20:59:33]  <Rig> Yeah, I did use one of my traits to define magical flavor.
[05-Jan-2014 20:59:54]  <IllFlower> yeah, maybe she has some preferred method of fighting.
[05-Jan-2014 20:59:58]  <Saladofstones> she has tenure
[05-Jan-2014 21:00:01]  <IllFlower> lol.
[05-Jan-2014 21:00:09]  <Saladofstones> uh
[05-Jan-2014 21:00:16]  <Rig> I also included a school activity.
[05-Jan-2014 21:00:22]  <Saladofstones> seriously though, I feel she's more of a magical investigator than anything else
[05-Jan-2014 21:00:27]  <Saladofstones> so perhaps something related to that
[05-Jan-2014 21:01:02]  <Rig> "reads a lot of detective stories"
[05-Jan-2014 21:01:14]  <Rig> "quotes Detective Dee frequently"
[05-Jan-2014 21:01:22]  <Saladofstones> I don't know what that is
[05-Jan-2014 21:02:30]  <Rig> A set of stories about a Chinese official.
[05-Jan-2014 21:02:37]  <Rig> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrated_Cases_of_Judge_Dee
[05-Jan-2014 21:02:37]  <Omnipresence> 14URL: [en.wikipedia.org] Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
[05-Jan-2014 21:03:39]  <Saladofstones> [messanger of the dragon palace] Can read the atmosphere
[05-Jan-2014 21:03:59]  <ponicalica> read the atmosphere: elemental affinity for air
[05-Jan-2014 21:04:43]  <Alicia> Should I have an elemental affinity or.
[05-Jan-2014 21:04:49]  <IllFlower> that'd actually be something interesting, a knack for reading the atmosphere.
[05-Jan-2014 21:05:17]  <IllFlower> (as opposed to Barcode's character, who didn't much care for that kinda thing, haha.)
[05-Jan-2014 21:05:33]  <Saladofstones> so I have the anti-snezana here
[05-Jan-2014 21:06:10]  <IllFlower> Alicia: it's not necessary, I think. we're all fairly satisfied with the traits you have.
[05-Jan-2014 21:07:22]  <Alicia> All right, cool.
[05-Jan-2014 21:07:44]  <Alicia> "Its a knack"
[05-Jan-2014 21:08:29]  <Rig> Okay, that's all the dice allocated. Any thoughts on traits?
[05-Jan-2014 21:08:39]  <IllFlower> so is this ability one for reading the atmosphere, air elementalism, or some pun-based mix of the two?
[05-Jan-2014 21:08:50]  <Saladofstones> mix of the two
[05-Jan-2014 21:09:23]  <IllFlower> hahaha. someone in the power-granting department has a very wry sense of humor. I don't mind that. anyone else?
[05-Jan-2014 21:09:58]  <Saladofstones> I'm good
[05-Jan-2014 21:10:54]  <Saladofstones> well this went smoothly
[05-Jan-2014 21:10:58]  <Saladofstones> is Ponicalica alive still?
[05-Jan-2014 21:11:08]  <ponicalica> yeah
[05-Jan-2014 21:11:08]  * Alicia pokes ponicalica.
[05-Jan-2014 21:11:26]  <Rig> I'm good with those traits.
[05-Jan-2014 21:11:46]  <IllFlower> okay, we'll all float on to relationships, then.
[05-Jan-2014 21:12:38]  <ponicalica> what's IllFlower's japanese quote in there?
[05-Jan-2014 21:12:43]  <IllFlower> reading through Hikari's relationships I'm a bit conflicted.
[05-Jan-2014 21:12:50]  <Saladofstones> so is hikari
[05-Jan-2014 21:13:34]  <IllFlower> the Conservator relationship itself is fine, not sure about the description... might excise that since it seems in conflict with the personality we've already established.
[05-Jan-2014 21:14:06]  <IllFlower> the friend relationship is a bit weird. if the friend is already distant, you'll have to justify how the relationship is still important in its present state.
[05-Jan-2014 21:14:25]  <Alicia> Mhmm…
[05-Jan-2014 21:14:50]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: I think yours work fairly well as they are.
[05-Jan-2014 21:15:01]  <Saladofstones> yeah I am satisfied
[05-Jan-2014 21:15:48]  *** Barcode <~Barcode@dhcp-c8-d7-19-26-33-7c.cpe.sourcecable.net> has joined #madokamadness
[05-Jan-2014 21:15:48]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Barcode
[05-Jan-2014 21:15:56]  <Rig> You could turn the distant-friend into a friend that is concerned about where all Hikari's free time is going.
[05-Jan-2014 21:16:07]  <Alicia> Maybe the friend is simply just someone like who she wants to be? Then I can remove the distant bit.
[05-Jan-2014 21:16:35]  <Saladofstones> that kind of gets close to hibiki's relationship with her dad
[05-Jan-2014 21:16:37]  <Saladofstones> also brb, lunch
[05-Jan-2014 21:16:46]  <Alicia> True, true.
[05-Jan-2014 21:17:05]  <IllFlower> well, we have a fair few relationships that are like that.
[05-Jan-2014 21:17:35]  <IllFlower> ponicalica's kinda got one (in an "I'll show you" kind of fashion).
[05-Jan-2014 21:18:18]  <Alicia> In this case it'd be a positive role model. Hibiki's all "I don't want to be like you," Hikari desperately wants to be like [friend] because of these ideals, so on for ponny.
[05-Jan-2014 21:19:31]  <IllFlower> hm, Hikari doesn't seem like the kind of person who would really take to that kind of idealism.
[05-Jan-2014 21:19:33]  <Alicia> I'll just put down a description or something, and IllFlower can fill in a name later? >_>;
[05-Jan-2014 21:20:21]  <IllFlower> I could see something like "she wants to be closer" (or more honest) considering that whole outer/inner self thing she's got going.
[05-Jan-2014 21:21:41]  <Alicia> Hm, yeah, she wants to be a better friend to someone who's been there for her, but to even talk about this stuff would open up the fact that she is… but is not, that sort of stuff.
[05-Jan-2014 21:22:14]  <Alicia> Also, I like Hibiki's description.
[05-Jan-2014 21:23:34]  <IllFlower> she knows there's something missing. her best friend holds the key to finding it. she just has no idea what that something is.
[05-Jan-2014 21:23:57]  <Alicia> Mhm.
[05-Jan-2014 21:24:00]  <IllFlower> but God knows if her best friend ever got tangled up in any of this mess she'd hate herself for the rest of her life.
[05-Jan-2014 21:24:13]  <Alicia> The life of a Conservator.
[05-Jan-2014 21:25:30]  <IllFlower> if you want flavor text, "something missing, she's [he's?] the key" should be enough to jog our minds :p
[05-Jan-2014 21:26:05]  <Alicia> I'll keep it ambiguous, you do with the character as you wish beyond the flavor text. :p
[05-Jan-2014 21:26:28]  <Alicia> With regards to names, sex, etc., I mean.
[05-Jan-2014 21:26:34]  <Alicia> name*
[05-Jan-2014 21:26:39]  <IllFlower> well, it *is* your character's best friend, I only come up with names, and then only when I'm bored ;)
[05-Jan-2014 21:27:09]  <Barcode> just don't call him greg sunogahara or somethin'.
[05-Jan-2014 21:28:00]  <Alicia> I wanted to use a name but then realized they'd be teh gaijin. :I
[05-Jan-2014 21:28:09]  * Alicia thinks of a Japanese name.
[05-Jan-2014 21:28:15]  <IllFlower> "Barc 'Barcode' Odelay"
[05-Jan-2014 21:28:23]  <Barcode> ._.
[05-Jan-2014 21:28:26]  <Alicia> XD
[05-Jan-2014 21:28:48]  <IllFlower> apparently someone in the family was a big Beck fan? I dunno.
[05-Jan-2014 21:29:13]  <IllFlower> Alicia: I'd say that names are unimportant until the character comes up, you can always leave it blank for later.
[05-Jan-2014 21:29:28]  <Barcode> yeah, just Hikari's Friend d# works.
[05-Jan-2014 21:29:31]  <IllFlower> (just like you can leave most of the relationship dice unused for later.)
[05-Jan-2014 21:29:57]  <Alicia> All righty. I think I'll put down Junpei anyway since it works as well as anything else.
[05-Jan-2014 21:30:24]  <Alicia> I think that's it for my relationships, for now?
[05-Jan-2014 21:30:39]  <IllFlower> "Jun--" "yes, you called?" "--pei--" "oh, goddammit, Hikari, stop doing that."
[05-Jan-2014 21:31:11]  <Alicia> :3
[05-Jan-2014 21:31:13]  <IllFlower> okay, everyone here? we're going into belongings next.
[05-Jan-2014 21:31:46]  <IllFlower> feel free to think of whatever. keep them to something you can keep on your person, though.
[05-Jan-2014 21:31:54]  <Saladofstones> I'm back
[05-Jan-2014 21:31:57]  <Alicia> I am still here. The twenty seconds have not changed me.
[05-Jan-2014 21:32:04]  * Alicia thinks.
[05-Jan-2014 21:32:45]  <Alicia> How many dice do we have for them, or what.
[05-Jan-2014 21:33:12]  <Barcode> also for fun: your meguka costume you can describe, as you can your megukal weapon
[05-Jan-2014 21:33:23]  <IllFlower> there's the stuff on page 28 for costumes as well. we're basically s/coat/costume/g throughout the manual.
[05-Jan-2014 21:33:28]  <Barcode> the "coat" is replaced by your trasnsformation's costume, and the weapon replaces the gun.
[05-Jan-2014 21:33:43]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: whats the moonspeek under its a knack?
[05-Jan-2014 21:34:06]  <Saladofstones> also is today ichka?
[05-Jan-2014 21:34:25]  <IllFlower> "read the atmosphere"
[05-Jan-2014 21:34:57]  <IllFlower> 2d6 is a good default for a costume. 1d6 if it's seen lots of wear, like Jun's has.
[05-Jan-2014 21:35:24]  <IllFlower> you have basically as many dice as you want for belongings, but keep the the rules for assigning them on page 27, and note that we'll stop you if you get too crazy.
[05-Jan-2014 21:35:44]  <Alicia> All right.
[05-Jan-2014 21:35:46]  <IllFlower> magical weapons get an additional 1d4.
[05-Jan-2014 21:35:47]  <Barcode> if you're afraid of powergaming, you can consult my character, who even has a baton for non-magical fighting
[05-Jan-2014 21:35:59]  <Barcode> yeah, magical weapons, like guns, are the only items that get different-type dice added to them.
[05-Jan-2014 21:36:11]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[05-Jan-2014 21:36:14]  <Barcode> and in their case it's simply "1d4 + [the other die type]".
[05-Jan-2014 21:36:30]  <IllFlower> again, you don't have to have a magical weapon. Jun has none, for example.
[05-Jan-2014 21:36:46]  <Rig> Though I did make a laser sword in our last encounter.
[05-Jan-2014 21:36:47]  <Alicia> I want a magical weapon.
[05-Jan-2014 21:36:47]  <Rig> ^_^
[05-Jan-2014 21:37:36]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[05-Jan-2014 21:37:43]  <Barcode> still disappointed i never really got the chance to get hitomi to swing the meteor hammer :(
[05-Jan-2014 21:37:56]  <Barcode> though i figured she wouldn't risk getting killed for bla bla bla plot
[05-Jan-2014 21:37:57]  <Saladofstones> would hidden blades ala assassin's creed by okay?
[05-Jan-2014 21:38:03]  <Alicia> Can I have a fancy right. Like, would that be 1d6 or 2d6.
[05-Jan-2014 21:38:06]  <Alicia> ring*
[05-Jan-2014 21:38:12]  <Alicia> Ring, right, totally the same deal.
[05-Jan-2014 21:38:13]  <Alicia> :|
[05-Jan-2014 21:38:15]  <Barcode> Saladofstones: in-magic, anything goes. outside of magic would be more questionable
[05-Jan-2014 21:38:30]  <Rig> 2d6 is exceptional quality.
[05-Jan-2014 21:38:57]  <Saladofstones> As theoretically someone whose been doing this a fair time, and someone who is an investigator, having concealable hidden blades fits
[05-Jan-2014 21:38:59]  <Saladofstones> and are fucking cool
[05-Jan-2014 21:38:59]  * Alicia considers its importance.
[05-Jan-2014 21:39:02]  <IllFlower> yeah, again, I point to the die rules at the bottom of page 27.
[05-Jan-2014 21:39:45]  <IllFlower> Hitomi did have a baton, so it's hardly out of the question that Hibiki might have blades.
[05-Jan-2014 21:39:48]  <Alicia> Oh yeah and we also describe our costume, huh.
[05-Jan-2014 21:39:54]  <ponicalica> yeah.
[05-Jan-2014 21:40:01]  <ponicalica> I added a bunch of description way after char creation though
[05-Jan-2014 21:40:08]  <Alicia> Ah, okay.
[05-Jan-2014 21:40:11]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking back to the scene in Kino's Journey where she's forced to disarm and drops about seven knives.
[05-Jan-2014 21:40:17]  <Barcode> heh
[05-Jan-2014 21:40:18]  <Alicia> Yeah I'll focus on the outfit later.
[05-Jan-2014 21:40:36]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[05-Jan-2014 21:40:37]  <Barcode> something else to consider is that magical murder is something the order tries to avoid, becvause Bad Shit Happens then. In the same way that murder in regular Dogs is something that reeks of Demonic INfluence. That being said, having a boot knife or thirty could work.
[05-Jan-2014 21:40:51]  <IllFlower> yeah, I should have been clearer - a lot of the description on the character sheet was added after character creation, as everyone got a better sense of their characters.
[05-Jan-2014 21:41:07]  <IllFlower> usually, just a sentence or less is enough to start.
[05-Jan-2014 21:41:10]  <Barcode> granted, dogs /also/ has "your character just shoots people who are causing trouble" as a reasonable plot thing
[05-Jan-2014 21:41:24]  <Barcode> a reasonasble character thing*
[05-Jan-2014 21:41:45]  <Alicia> Well how am I going to work a sweet-ass axe into it. :x Hikari may be obsessive but she won't *completely* maul a bad guy because.
[05-Jan-2014 21:41:49]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: that would have been to good to know
[05-Jan-2014 21:41:51]  <IllFlower> Barcode: well, technically, Dogs have a very long chain, and if they decide to shoot someone most people will just say, "ah, that's the King's will."
[05-Jan-2014 21:41:59]  <Rig> And I don't think any of us have used our belongings much.
[05-Jan-2014 21:42:05]  <Rig> They're there for flavor more than dice.
[05-Jan-2014 21:42:34]  <Alicia> Mkay.
[05-Jan-2014 21:42:41]  <Rig> Gideon (my Dogs character) literally thought of himself as the executor of the King's Will.
[05-Jan-2014 21:42:49]  <Barcode> Alicia: you could have a magical axe.
[05-Jan-2014 21:42:55]  <Rig> Gideon was a fun character. Playing a super religious dude was cool.
[05-Jan-2014 21:42:55]  <Alicia> :D
[05-Jan-2014 21:42:57]  <Barcode> as in one you use if shit gets to literal meguking.
[05-Jan-2014 21:43:11]  <Alicia> Yes, that's what I meant. Not one to carry around.
[05-Jan-2014 21:43:11]  <IllFlower> Rig: Hitomi cracked Kazuto's knee with her baton, and then Ayako went through basically half her belongings desperately trying to save Jun :p
[05-Jan-2014 21:43:14]  <ponicalica> of course, if it does you're probably fucked, but still :P
[05-Jan-2014 21:43:22]  <Alicia> <_< >_>
[05-Jan-2014 21:43:26]  <IllFlower> Rig's point is valid, though. you don't have to think too hard about belongings.
[05-Jan-2014 21:43:31]  <Rig> IllFlower: Jun did use her lipstick and shit during that last fight.
[05-Jan-2014 21:44:14]  <IllFlower> I think dice for the costume, and then one or two other belongings, ought to be enough to start.
[05-Jan-2014 21:44:46]  <Barcode> yeah, you don't need a whole inventory.
[05-Jan-2014 21:45:05]  <IllFlower> also, I reserve the right to think of rings as methods of unleashing blood magic, à la Beyond the Boundary.
[05-Jan-2014 21:45:34]  <Saladofstones> >beyond the boundary
[05-Jan-2014 21:45:38]  <Saladofstones> >kyoani didn't find a way
[05-Jan-2014 21:45:42]  <Alicia> You do not know how totally okay I am with that, IllFlower.
[05-Jan-2014 21:45:43]  <Alicia> :|
[05-Jan-2014 21:45:51]  * Barcode remembers AoT
[05-Jan-2014 21:46:11]  <Saladofstones> death to infidels
[05-Jan-2014 21:46:44]  <Saladofstones> fucking shit
[05-Jan-2014 21:46:54]  <IllFlower> "hemomancer 2d8"
[05-Jan-2014 21:47:01]  <Rig> phlebomancer
[05-Jan-2014 21:47:09]  <ponicalica> elemental affinity to blood
[05-Jan-2014 21:47:24]  <Rig> I come from the elemental plane of grit.
[05-Jan-2014 21:47:33]  <Rig> Barcode is from the elemental plane of diesel.
[05-Jan-2014 21:47:49]  <Alicia> I come from the elemental plane of love.
[05-Jan-2014 21:48:08]  * Barcode chuckles wheezingly, flame effects in the background
[05-Jan-2014 21:48:46]  <IllFlower> Saladofstones: any belongings?
[05-Jan-2014 21:49:07]  <Saladofstones> are all megucauniforms 2d6?
[05-Jan-2014 21:49:19]  <Rig> nope
[05-Jan-2014 21:49:26]  <Rig> 2d6 is the base.
[05-Jan-2014 21:49:36]  <Rig> Jun's is old and worn down.
[05-Jan-2014 21:49:38]  <Rig> So it's 1d6.
[05-Jan-2014 21:49:39]  <IllFlower> they're usually 2d6, but if they've seen particular history they can be bumped up or down (usually down).
[05-Jan-2014 21:50:05]  <IllFlower> in this game, the costumes are more symbolic of the character than they are physical entities.
[05-Jan-2014 21:50:05]  <Alicia> I put down three, I might want to put down more fluff later but this is good.
[05-Jan-2014 21:50:15]  <IllFlower> Jun's had some tough times, so her costume is 1d6.
[05-Jan-2014 21:51:58]  <Alicia> "fights to defend the institution of magic and the hierarchy; deeply trusts the system" This is going to (keep being) good, huh.
[05-Jan-2014 21:52:10]  <Alicia> Going to keep being. Whatever.
[05-Jan-2014 21:52:16]  <Alicia> It is good, and will be, it sounds like.
[05-Jan-2014 21:53:14]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: So for magical weapons, can I have a pair of hidden blades ala assassins creed?
[05-Jan-2014 21:53:33]  <Saladofstones> other than that, perhaps one of the belongings is a tome of some variety going over the subleties of magic thats all full of arcane and shit
[05-Jan-2014 21:53:38]  <IllFlower> yeah, you can do basically whatever for magical weapons.
[05-Jan-2014 21:53:50]  <Alicia> (Bazooka.)
[05-Jan-2014 21:53:53]  <Alicia> (no not really.)
[05-Jan-2014 21:54:06]  <IllFlower> I'd say not to go too crazy, just so the dice match the weapon, but blades? blades are definitely d6-able.
[05-Jan-2014 21:54:52]  <Barcode> quake-style RL. dodgeable, but deadly
[05-Jan-2014 21:55:06]  <Rig> 2d10 Excellent Rocket Launcher
[05-Jan-2014 21:55:11]  <Barcode> taking the hit could be rocket jumping to avoid attax
[05-Jan-2014 21:55:25]  <Saladofstones> so for the 1d4 for magical weapons
[05-Jan-2014 21:55:38]  <Rig> It's just added to the normal value for the object.
[05-Jan-2014 21:55:40]  <Saladofstones> can they be excellent blades to represent my time in the conservators
[05-Jan-2014 21:56:01]  <Alicia> But 1d4 is for crap/worn stuff, I thought.
[05-Jan-2014 21:56:08]  <Alicia> Oh wait.
[05-Jan-2014 21:56:11]  <Saladofstones> its an additional modifier
[05-Jan-2014 21:56:11]  <Alicia> Magical weapons.
[05-Jan-2014 21:56:20]  <Alicia> Yeah I got mixed up.
[05-Jan-2014 21:56:33]  <Saladofstones> as for ordinary things, maybe a russian naval hat
[05-Jan-2014 21:56:55]  <IllFlower> I don't have any particular objections to 2d6 blades, other than the part where I'm uncomfortably reminded of JackMackerel.
[05-Jan-2014 21:57:09]  <Rig> Hm.
[05-Jan-2014 21:57:13]  <Alicia> ?
[05-Jan-2014 21:57:16]  <Alicia> What'd he do.
[05-Jan-2014 21:57:18]  <Rig> I think naval hats are pushing it.
[05-Jan-2014 21:57:28]  <Saladofstones> russian surplus is everywhere comrade
[05-Jan-2014 21:58:15]  <IllFlower> >Hibiki's costume is entirely Soviet-era officer surplus
[05-Jan-2014 21:58:26]  <Rig> Well, belongings are supposed to be things you can carry with you.
[05-Jan-2014 21:58:38]  <Saladofstones> well I can just always wear a hat
[05-Jan-2014 21:58:47]  <Rig> What kind of hat are we talking about?
[05-Jan-2014 21:59:16]  <Saladofstones> http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130901123715/kancolle/images/b/bf/072.jpg this kind

[05-Jan-2014 21:59:25]  <Saladofstones> its not magical
[05-Jan-2014 22:00:03]  <Rig> Yeah, I guess that sounds okay.
[05-Jan-2014 22:00:44]  * IllFlower reads image caption
[05-Jan-2014 22:00:45]  <IllFlower> lulz
[05-Jan-2014 22:00:57]  <Saladofstones> now he realizes
[05-Jan-2014 22:01:48]  <IllFlower> I don't actually know anything about Kantai Collection, man.
[05-Jan-2014 22:02:06]  <Rig> Okay, any more belongings?
[05-Jan-2014 22:02:10]  <Saladofstones> thats it for me
[05-Jan-2014 22:03:09]  <Saladofstones> Illflower: come on man, don't you want to be part of the sensation?
[05-Jan-2014 22:03:10]  <IllFlower> okay, now we go for initiations!
[05-Jan-2014 22:03:11]  <Saladofstones> carnival da yo
[05-Jan-2014 22:03:15]  <Alicia> I'm good.
[05-Jan-2014 22:03:46]  <IllFlower> I don't need moe ships. I'm swimming in moe.
[05-Jan-2014 22:04:02]  <Saladofstones> you need ships to ford the thames, comrade
[05-Jan-2014 22:04:49]  <IllFlower> anyway, initiation instructions are on page 28.
[05-Jan-2014 22:05:28]  <Saladofstones> "I hope my character becomes a soviet history professor"
[05-Jan-2014 22:05:34]  <Saladofstones> this sounds interesting
[05-Jan-2014 22:05:41]  <IllFlower> the first step is to think of something you want your character to have accomplished during initiation.
[05-Jan-2014 22:06:16]  <IllFlower> we have to do this one at a time, so the player for whom we have the first workable idea will go first.
[05-Jan-2014 22:08:38]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[05-Jan-2014 22:08:44]  <Saladofstones> I don't want to pick something that will break my character
[05-Jan-2014 22:09:19]  <Alicia> I hope that my character becomes a conservator while keeping a steady mind.
[05-Jan-2014 22:09:23]  <Alicia> Is that good?
[05-Jan-2014 22:09:26]  <ponicalica> it has to be something that still works if you fail
[05-Jan-2014 22:09:40]  <Alicia> Hm.
[05-Jan-2014 22:10:12]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: the thing being is that you don't want it to really be bad if you don't reach it
[05-Jan-2014 22:10:33]  <Alicia> Yeah. What to think up…
[05-Jan-2014 22:10:41]  <Saladofstones> How about "I hope Hibiki is able to accomplish her original goal of expanding cosnervators powers?
[05-Jan-2014 22:10:55]  <Saladofstones> I'd want to say that she avoids getting in trouble but eh
[05-Jan-2014 22:11:48]  <IllFlower> that's really abstract, kind of hard to to a concrete conflict with.
[05-Jan-2014 22:12:41]  <IllFlower> also, if you look at the initiations of the existing characters, none of them directly dealt with conservatorship, so don't feel obligated to bind yourself that way.
[05-Jan-2014 22:12:57]  <IllFlower> the initiation is really just some event that further defines the character.
[05-Jan-2014 22:13:21]  <IllFlower> nothing to do with the point at which she became a magical girl, or a conservator, necessarily.
[05-Jan-2014 22:13:59]  <Alicia> Noted.
[05-Jan-2014 22:14:06]  * Alicia tries to think up a scenario.
[05-Jan-2014 22:14:12]  <Saladofstones> what did someone else do as an initiation?
[05-Jan-2014 22:14:50]  <Rig> «Okay, so Jun hopes that she can solve problems without resorting to violence.»
[05-Jan-2014 22:14:54]  <Rig> You were even there for this.
[05-Jan-2014 22:15:02]  <Rig> https://room208.org/logs/memoriam/sessions/01-initiations.html

[05-Jan-2014 22:15:31]  <Rig> «How about something along the lines of "I hope I'm ready to deal with other people's problems"?»
[05-Jan-2014 22:16:47]  <Rig> "I hope my character saved someone from committing suicide." That was Jun's.
[05-Jan-2014 22:17:05]  <Saladofstones> "
[05-Jan-2014 22:17:05]  <Saladofstones> 08-09 20:38 Rig Bardick, long lost brother of Riddick.

[05-Jan-2014 22:17:12]  <Saladofstones> oh okay
[05-Jan-2014 22:18:11]  <Alicia> Hikari hopes that she can save someone from a brigand.
[05-Jan-2014 22:18:27]  <Saladofstones> brigand?
[05-Jan-2014 22:18:29]  <Alicia> (Or would it be a group of them, or would that be too much?)
[05-Jan-2014 22:18:32]  <Alicia> Thief, robber.
[05-Jan-2014 22:18:41]  <IllFlower> haha, we're pretty urban for a brigand, but the general idea is kinda sound.
[05-Jan-2014 22:19:15]  <Alicia> Yeah, I'm not sure how far into the mountains it'd be, and whatnot. :p
[05-Jan-2014 22:19:21]  <Alicia> we'd be*
[05-Jan-2014 22:19:36]  <IllFlower> seems abnormally self-sacrificial for the character by itself, but maybe it's something she does for showier reasons?
[05-Jan-2014 22:20:02]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[05-Jan-2014 22:21:31]  <IllFlower> either way, Alicia, I'm fine with the general outlines of that.
[05-Jan-2014 22:21:46]  <Alicia> If you're going to be doing God's Work, *sometimes* you'll have to get your hands dirty, and showing off that she can handle this stuff is a fine idea.
[05-Jan-2014 22:21:54]  <Alicia> ("They're just *thieves*")
[05-Jan-2014 22:22:31]  <Alicia> (She thinks is a decent idea, even if there will be pain involved.)
[05-Jan-2014 22:23:15]  <Saladofstones> Hibiki wants to get out of this chickenshit outfit without incident
[05-Jan-2014 22:23:20]  <Saladofstones> @yt starcraft marine quotes

[05-Jan-2014 22:23:31]  <IllFlower> Alicia: okay, so something like her wanting to prove to someone (maybe a peer) that she's cut out for the job?
[05-Jan-2014 22:23:52]  <Alicia> Pretty much, yeah.
[05-Jan-2014 22:24:30]  <IllFlower> okay, gimme a sec to think.
[05-Jan-2014 22:24:33]  <Alicia> Hikari hopes that she can stand her ground against a thief and prove herself to her peers.
[05-Jan-2014 22:24:44]  <IllFlower> comments from the audience?
[05-Jan-2014 22:24:47]  <Alicia> and as a result*
[05-Jan-2014 22:24:58]  <Barcode> getting dressed, then eating something. let's see
[05-Jan-2014 22:24:59]  <Saladofstones> Alicia: Does she also want to prove her ideal of justice?
[05-Jan-2014 22:25:10]  <Barcode> this is non-magical, then?
[05-Jan-2014 22:25:23]  <Barcode> just, hey thief, stop that, in her school uniform
[05-Jan-2014 22:25:23]  <Rig> Like, is someone getting mugged or something?
[05-Jan-2014 22:25:43]  <Rig> No real objections.
[05-Jan-2014 22:25:45]  <Barcode> mugging might be more specific in a good way
[05-Jan-2014 22:25:47]  <Rig> Just need to see it set.
[05-Jan-2014 22:25:53]  <Alicia> They're thieves, Saladofstones, I think that's enough reason to jump nto action from "Hey stop mugging that old man you dick."
[05-Jan-2014 22:26:01]  <Barcode> arright, so, yes, mugging :P
[05-Jan-2014 22:26:18]  <Alicia> into*
[05-Jan-2014 22:26:40]  <IllFlower> we could always cast it as a consequence of "witchy influence" if we need to connect it to magic somehow.
[05-Jan-2014 22:26:56]  <Alicia> Yes.
[05-Jan-2014 22:27:00]  <Alicia> Dern witches.
[05-Jan-2014 22:27:39]  <Barcode> stealing our wallets.
[05-Jan-2014 22:27:47]  <IllFlower> okay, let's think of a setting. alleyway? lonely apartment block?
[05-Jan-2014 22:28:04]  <Rig> I like the apartment block.
[05-Jan-2014 22:28:05]  <Alicia> "Jun sees the knife and the girl. She vaguely recognizes her from one of the other after school activities, but can't remember her name. "Hey, are you okay?" See: 5 1; Remaining: 45566" Sees and Raises confuse me.
[05-Jan-2014 22:28:13]  <Alicia> Yeah, apartment block.
[05-Jan-2014 22:28:17]  <Rig> What's confusing about them?
[05-Jan-2014 22:28:18]  <IllFlower> we'll get into that in just a second, don't worry. :p
[05-Jan-2014 22:28:20]  <Barcode> ^
[05-Jan-2014 22:28:24]  <Alicia> Mm.
[05-Jan-2014 22:28:46]  <IllFlower> okay, so we have a victim... let's say she's about Hikari's age? maybe a little older. how old is Hikari?
[05-Jan-2014 22:28:52]  <Alicia> 17.
[05-Jan-2014 22:29:09]  <Alicia> I was going to choose 18 but that's taken. It'd feel weird.
[05-Jan-2014 22:29:19]  <IllFlower> lol.
[05-Jan-2014 22:29:23]  <Alicia> >_>
[05-Jan-2014 22:30:01]  <IllFlower> I'm going to say our assailant has got a knife, just to raise the stakes a bit.
[05-Jan-2014 22:30:10]  <IllFlower> though I don't intend to cause anyone any lethal harm, of course.
[05-Jan-2014 22:30:10]  <Alicia> All right.
[05-Jan-2014 22:30:24]  <Rig> No, IllFlower would never kill a character.
[05-Jan-2014 22:30:31]  <Alicia> What kind of cruel GM are you actually no that's totally cool.
[05-Jan-2014 22:30:41]  <IllFlower> me? never, never!
[05-Jan-2014 22:30:49]  <IllFlower> there's a summary of the conflict rules on page 79.
[05-Jan-2014 22:31:07]  * Alicia reads.
[05-Jan-2014 22:31:12]  <IllFlower> I suggest opening at low stakes, e.g. talking.
[05-Jan-2014 22:31:43]  <IllFlower> the first step is always to roll dice. for this conflict, I'm obligated to roll 4d6+4d10. you'd roll, if we were to do talking, Ac+Ht.
[05-Jan-2014 22:32:36]  <Alicia> So that's 3d6+3d6?
[05-Jan-2014 22:32:49]  <IllFlower> yeah.
[05-Jan-2014 22:33:19]  <IllFlower> you may notice this puts you at a disadvantage right off the bat, but that's what traits and escalation are for.
[05-Jan-2014 22:33:24]  <IllFlower> +roll 4d6+4d10
[05-Jan-2014 22:33:25]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (1+1+1+5)+(7+8+4+4)=31
[05-Jan-2014 22:33:26]  <Alicia> Okay, yes. Do I… I haven't RP'd in forever. ._.
[05-Jan-2014 22:33:37]  <IllFlower> ... oh, or I could roll three 1s, that'd work too.
[05-Jan-2014 22:33:39]  <Barcode> check the conflict rules!
[05-Jan-2014 22:33:49]  <Barcode> IllFlower: this is revenge for your like, eight 10s in the final battle last game!
[05-Jan-2014 22:34:05]  <Rig> Has the scene actually been set?
[05-Jan-2014 22:34:09]  <IllFlower> if you need more details, there's a more fleshed-out explanation on page 54.
[05-Jan-2014 22:34:33]  <Alicia> +roll 3d6+3d6
[05-Jan-2014 22:34:33]  <rollermine> Alicia: (1+2+3)+(2+1+5)=14
[05-Jan-2014 22:35:17]  <IllFlower> Rig: yeah, gimme a second.
[05-Jan-2014 22:35:57]  <IllFlower> we're at an apartment block, Hikari is presumably just passing by... she's around a friend or two, presumably? because of that whole "showing off" thing from earlier.
[05-Jan-2014 22:36:38]  <Barcode> (pst, alicia, you can comment on that if you want!)
[05-Jan-2014 22:36:54]  <Barcode> ("it's been 40 seconds barcode")
[05-Jan-2014 22:36:56]  <Alicia> (I knooow! Just tense. Haven't done it in forever.)
[05-Jan-2014 22:37:26]  <IllFlower> you don't have to get every detail right. it's a building process.
[05-Jan-2014 22:37:36]  <Barcode> oh, yeah, you can backtrack SLIGHTLY too, so.
[05-Jan-2014 22:37:46]  <Barcode> broad strokes.
[05-Jan-2014 22:37:47]  *** Alicia is now known as Hiiragi
[05-Jan-2014 22:38:22]  <Saladofstones> Hiiararargi
[05-Jan-2014 22:38:45]  <Barcode> yes.
[05-Jan-2014 22:39:13]  <IllFlower> she rounds a corner, notices a man pulling a knife on a girl about her age, decides this is her chance to swing into action. you know, the usual.
[05-Jan-2014 22:40:02]  <IllFlower> this fine with everyone? I know it's bare-bones, haha
[05-Jan-2014 22:40:40]  <Saladofstones> for great justice
[05-Jan-2014 22:41:04]  * Hiiragi pushes her friends behind her slightly, motioning for them to be silent, before approaching the man to look him in the face. "What do you think you're doing, *sir*?" See 31, leave 1225.
[05-Jan-2014 22:41:13]  <Hiiragi> (Am I doing this right? ._.)
[05-Jan-2014 22:41:16]  <IllFlower> mm, hold on a second.
[05-Jan-2014 22:42:10]  <Rig> You're a bit eager on the dice there.
[05-Jan-2014 22:42:12]  <ponicalica> Hikari Hiiragi aka tongue twister name
[05-Jan-2014 22:42:27]  <IllFlower> technically, you raise first. raising is an "offensive" action, seeing is something you do in response. kinda like poker.
[05-Jan-2014 22:42:48]  <Hiiragi> Oh, my bad. >_< Yeah, that's what I meant to do.
[05-Jan-2014 22:42:55]  <Hiiragi> Maybe I shouldn't.
[05-Jan-2014 22:43:03]  <IllFlower> I have 11144578, okay.
[05-Jan-2014 22:43:10]  <Barcode> oh, IF opens, then?
[05-Jan-2014 22:43:22]  <Barcode> (i forgot.)
[05-Jan-2014 22:43:56]  <IllFlower> I think it could go either way. either the mugger does something unignorable (I open), or Hikari comes in to break things up (Alicia opens).
[05-Jan-2014 22:44:37]  <Hiiragi> Yeah, come up and stare him down (as much as possible).
[05-Jan-2014 22:44:49]  <Hiiragi> (At the very least, the other girl can escape.)
[05-Jan-2014 22:44:51]  <IllFlower> I should note that if you raise too low it's easy for me to reverse the blow by seeing your total with a single die.
[05-Jan-2014 22:44:59]  <Hiiragi> Oh, hm.
[05-Jan-2014 22:45:06]  <IllFlower> if you raise too high, though, you can easily blow dice you might need later.
[05-Jan-2014 22:45:18]  <Hiiragi> 32?
[05-Jan-2014 22:45:49]  <Rig> That can be countered with a single die.
[05-Jan-2014 22:46:02]  <Barcode> actually, anything she would do could be
[05-Jan-2014 22:46:05]  <IllFlower> you can also take time to consider whether any traits or relationships would be useful, especially now as your dice are fairly anemic.
[05-Jan-2014 22:46:06]  <Barcode> since he roleld an 8.
[05-Jan-2014 22:46:30]  <Barcode> unless yeah, you brought in other traits/dice/whatever.
[05-Jan-2014 22:46:40]  <IllFlower> for example, the "making a big scene" trait seems pretty applicable here, and that's 1d8.
[05-Jan-2014 22:46:47]  <Hiiragi> Bring in 1d8 — yeah.
[05-Jan-2014 22:46:54]  <Hiiragi> I was just going to type that.
[05-Jan-2014 22:47:22]  <IllFlower> if you get anything higher than a 3, you'll be in a better position.
[05-Jan-2014 22:47:46]  <Hiiragi> +roll 1d8
[05-Jan-2014 22:47:46]  <rollermine> Hiiragi: (7)=7
[05-Jan-2014 22:47:51]  <IllFlower> nicely done.
[05-Jan-2014 22:48:03]  <IllFlower> 1122357.
[05-Jan-2014 22:49:06]  <IllFlower> you can change the dice you raised with from that pool, now. I think the RP is just fine, no need to change that.
[05-Jan-2014 22:49:37]  <Hiiragi> Is 52 overdoing it? 32 is too little…
[05-Jan-2014 22:50:01]  <IllFlower> you'd need something that totals higher than 8 in order for me to not immediately reverse the blow.
[05-Jan-2014 22:50:15]  <Hiiragi> Bad rolls.
[05-Jan-2014 22:50:20]  <IllFlower> at the same time, perhaps that's appropriate for the narrative, maybe Hikari is getting in over her head.
[05-Jan-2014 22:51:51]  <Hiiragi> 52, yeah.
[05-Jan-2014 22:52:07]  <Hiiragi> Er. 521.
[05-Jan-2014 22:52:14]  <IllFlower> you can't raise with more than two dice.
[05-Jan-2014 22:52:19]  <Rig> You can only... yeah.
[05-Jan-2014 22:52:21]  <Hiiragi> Oh, my bad. 52.
[05-Jan-2014 22:52:40]  <Rig> You should probably do 72.
[05-Jan-2014 22:52:53]  <Hiiragi> … yeah. Raise 72.
[05-Jan-2014 22:53:02]  <IllFlower> okay, leaving 11235.
[05-Jan-2014 22:55:26]  <IllFlower> the man turns to glare at Hikari. "what goes on between Hayakawa and myself is is none of your business," he says with a grunt. see 18.
[05-Jan-2014 22:55:38]  <IllFlower> at this point it's my turn to raise. just a second.
[05-Jan-2014 22:57:00]  <IllFlower> "or would you rather I come after you too, young lady?" he flashes the blade at Hikari, the reflected sunlight glinting off of her forehead. raise 17, leave 1445.
[05-Jan-2014 22:57:05]  <IllFlower> **
[05-Jan-2014 22:58:05]  <Hiiragi> (This would, I'm pretty sure, be stressful, so could I roll the other 1d8 too?)
[05-Jan-2014 22:58:20]  <Hiiragi> (Life-threatening, also trying to save someone.)
[05-Jan-2014 22:58:41]  <IllFlower> that seems more like it'd call in your d4 trait, really.
[05-Jan-2014 22:58:48]  <Rig> Yeah.
[05-Jan-2014 22:58:48]  <Hiiragi> Point.
[05-Jan-2014 22:58:53]  <IllFlower> since she's being directly threatened.
[05-Jan-2014 22:59:17]  <IllFlower> you can always escalate to punching me if you don't think things are going in your favor. I can't add dice.
[05-Jan-2014 22:59:17]  <Rig> you could also roll the d6 for the good of others if you try to talk him into being good.
[05-Jan-2014 22:59:28]  <IllFlower> that too.
[05-Jan-2014 23:00:06]  <Hiiragi> Punching people totally has to do with the good of others.
[05-Jan-2014 23:00:24]  <Hiiragi> How does escalation work?
[05-Jan-2014 23:00:57]  <IllFlower> escalating lets you bring in additional dice, at the cost of raising the severity of any fallout you might take.
[05-Jan-2014 23:01:00]  <IllFlower> the details are on page 70.
[05-Jan-2014 23:01:33]  <Hiiragi> Hm.
[05-Jan-2014 23:02:12]  <Hiiragi> I'll escalate.
[05-Jan-2014 23:02:41]  <Barcode> Alright, in what way?
[05-Jan-2014 23:02:58]  <Barcode> Body and Heart (you get your Body dice) means you'd try to do something physical without hurting the guy. Trying ot hurt him physically would be Body and Will (IIRC).
[05-Jan-2014 23:03:34]  <Hiiragi> Oh okay, so that'd be Body and Will, then I describe…
[05-Jan-2014 23:03:40]  <Hiiragi> respond*
[05-Jan-2014 23:03:51]  <SpruceZeus> I'll escalate. <- WWMD? (What Would Makoto Do?)
[05-Jan-2014 23:03:51]  <IllFlower> do you want to escalate to hand-to-hand fighting, then?
[05-Jan-2014 23:03:58]  <Hiiragi> Yes.
[05-Jan-2014 23:04:07]  <Barcode> Just keep in mind he's got a knife. She'd risk punching him?
[05-Jan-2014 23:04:30]  <Barcode> I mean, she could always be relying on "who would stab a teenage girl", if she's bold enough, of course.
[05-Jan-2014 23:04:31]  <Hiiragi> There are always groin kicks…
[05-Jan-2014 23:04:33]  <IllFlower> Barcode: well, RP-wise I don't get any additional dice, so if she rolls well it doesn't matter.
[05-Jan-2014 23:04:44]  <Barcode> true. it'd be up to you to decide why that works.
[05-Jan-2014 23:04:49]  <IllFlower> yeah, I've got ideas.
[05-Jan-2014 23:04:54]  <IllFlower> Hiiragi: roll Bd+Wl.
[05-Jan-2014 23:05:05]  <Hiiragi> +roll 3d6+4d6
[05-Jan-2014 23:05:06]  <rollermine> Hiiragi: (6+1+3)+(1+2+6+2)=21
[05-Jan-2014 23:05:12]  <Hiiragi> Eek.
[05-Jan-2014 23:05:27]  <IllFlower> 111122233566.
[05-Jan-2014 23:05:47]  <IllFlower> I do recommend keeping track of your dice on a piece of paper somewhere, definitely beats scrolling :p
[05-Jan-2014 23:06:00]  <Hiiragi> I am.
[05-Jan-2014 23:06:10]  <Barcode> alternatively, a text file.
[05-Jan-2014 23:07:49]  <IllFlower> you have a fair number of high dice and the best I can see without taking fallout is 9. if you want to try to crack this fellow's jaw, you can do that ;)

[05-Jan-2014 23:09:00]  * Hiiragi says "You don't have that out once you start threatening someone!" and kicks him in the groin with the tip of her boots. See 65, leave 632221111.
[05-Jan-2014 23:09:15]  <Hiiragi> (I forgot to put down that she wears boots, sorry.)
[05-Jan-2014 23:09:25]  <IllFlower> direct, aren't we? hahaha
[05-Jan-2014 23:09:27]  <Barcode> notreally important, don't worry.
[05-Jan-2014 23:09:42]  <Hiiragi> The only good REKT is direct, IllFlower.

[05-Jan-2014 23:10:56]  <IllFlower> that is hella brutal, only way I can see that is with 445 and then I don't have enough left to raise (1).
[05-Jan-2014 23:11:20]  <Hiiragi> Whoops.
[05-Jan-2014 23:11:27]  <IllFlower> not a bad thing, haha.
[05-Jan-2014 23:11:32]  <IllFlower> I mean, it is a groin kick.
[05-Jan-2014 23:11:36]  <Hiiragi> Yes. :)
[05-Jan-2014 23:12:36]  <ponicalica> gj hikari
[05-Jan-2014 23:12:36]  <IllFlower> the kick catches our assailant squarely in its target, causing him to drop the knife and double over in shock. see 445. can't raise. presumably Hikari collars this fellow and drags him off to the nearest police substation or something.
[05-Jan-2014 23:13:03]  <IllFlower> we're done here. add a d6 trait, Hiiragi.
[05-Jan-2014 23:13:31]  <IllFlower> "I can defend others" or "I stand for justice" or even "I'm good at aiming groin kicks 1d6."

Come on, friends, we're done here. You two hold him down while I look for something to restrain him with before we take him to the police."

[05-Jan-2014 23:20:51]  <IllFlower> something that can be settled in the course of a single conflict, of course.
[05-Jan-2014 23:21:00]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[05-Jan-2014 23:21:27]  <IllFlower> she prides herself on being able to sleuth, so maybe something related to that?
[05-Jan-2014 23:21:48]  <Saladofstones> I'm thinking that she wants to meet with a local contact and learn more about going ons?
[05-Jan-2014 23:21:53]  <Saladofstones> figure out whats been happening

[05-Jan-2014 23:23:03]  <Saladofstones> this is a stealth mission
[05-Jan-2014 23:23:34]  <IllFlower> the big thing is that it should be something that really affects the character. the end result is a trait getting added, after all.

[05-Jan-2014 23:25:13]  <SpruceZeus> this is a stealth mission <- meguca gear solid
[05-Jan-2014 23:25:25]  <Saladofstones> I was thinking something like that, but can't the stakes be too high?
[05-Jan-2014 23:25:32]  <Saladofstones> since the failure presumabely is that she isn't reinstated
[05-Jan-2014 23:25:36]  <IllFlower> if she fails then there's a backup, someone else pulls strings for her, but failing to defend herself would leave a psychological impact.
[05-Jan-2014 23:26:16]  <Barcode> oh, that's true. you could have someone who cares for the character come to her side in the case, which can leave her thinking "what, who cares, why bother" and then also "i'm not self-sufficient like my ideals say i should be"
[05-Jan-2014 23:26:27]  <IllFlower> yeah, exactly.
[05-Jan-2014 23:26:58]  <Barcode> if you win, of course, the opposite would be true - you'd feel better about your ideals and all that. either way, works out well.
[05-Jan-2014 23:27:02]  <SpruceZeus> http://safebooru.org/index.php?page=post&s=view&id=922549 of course someone did it already

[05-Jan-2014 23:28:40]  <IllFlower> okay, let's set the stage, then. Hibiki's been summoned before the Order's Shadowy Tribunal of Shadows as part of her reinstatement hearing.

[05-Jan-2014 23:29:34]  <IllFlower> it seems to be mostly composed of old men, in line with what we've established before `_`
[05-Jan-2014 23:29:52]  <Hibiki> (Down with the old man corporate culture of megucas)
[05-Jan-2014 23:30:01]  <Barcode> ^
[05-Jan-2014 23:30:42]  <IllFlower> I'll be playing the tribunal's membership, of course.
[05-Jan-2014 23:31:01]  <IllFlower> this'll be a talky conflict; I don't suggest escalating ;)
[05-Jan-2014 23:31:02]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@182.55.188.37> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[05-Jan-2014 23:31:22]  <Hibiki> (I don't see what escalating would gain me, unless I kill the council)
[05-Jan-2014 23:31:52]  <SpruceZeus> smash the patriarchy!
[05-Jan-2014 23:31:52]  <Barcode> well, it'd let your character "win" the case, unless your character wants to specifically win it verbally. but yeah it wouldn't make senes for other reasons.
[05-Jan-2014 23:31:55]  <IllFlower> RP-wise it'd gain you dice, but in terms of the narrative you'd probably get yourself banished to another dimension before you could even transform
[05-Jan-2014 23:32:04]  <IllFlower> sooo not happening.
[05-Jan-2014 23:32:10]  <Rig> I did a taking initiation for Gideon.
[05-Jan-2014 23:32:12]  <Rig> Was fun.

[05-Jan-2014 23:32:35]  <IllFlower> Hibiki, roll Ac+Ht. I'll roll 4d6+4d10 as usual, and then raise since I'm asking the questions here.
[05-Jan-2014 23:32:50]  <Hibiki> having such low heart is going to be a bitch
[05-Jan-2014 23:32:53]  <IllFlower> note that talky conflicts are pretty freeform, you don't have to sweat getting all the details right.

[05-Jan-2014 23:33:27]  <Hibiki> (will I begin or will you? my understanding is that my reinstatement is guarnteed to me already, just at a lwoer rank. So I'm not sure what I'm argunig for)
[05-Jan-2014 23:33:49]  <IllFlower> your own pride more than anything else, I think.
[05-Jan-2014 23:33:59]  <Hibiki> so is it a show trial, more or less?
[05-Jan-2014 23:34:20]  <Barcode> meta-wise it is, but in-conflict you don't know that.
[05-Jan-2014 23:34:41]  <IllFlower> yeah, none of the characters have made up their minds yet, this is your chance to impress them.
[05-Jan-2014 23:35:07]  <Hibiki> this is massively scary but lets begin
[05-Jan-2014 23:35:48]  <IllFlower> okay, go ahead and roll.
[05-Jan-2014 23:35:51]  <IllFlower> +roll 4d6+4d10
[05-Jan-2014 23:35:52]  <rollermine> IllFlower: (5+4+4+4)+(2+9+10+7)=45
[05-Jan-2014 23:36:22]  <Hiiragi> Oh my.
[05-Jan-2014 23:36:32]  <Hibiki> +roll 5d6+2d6
[05-Jan-2014 23:36:32]  <rollermine> Hibiki: (4+1+2+1+6)+(3+3)=20
[05-Jan-2014 23:36:34]  <Hibiki> fuck
[05-Jan-2014 23:37:06]  <Hibiki> kuso
[05-Jan-2014 23:37:08]  <Hibiki> rather
[05-Jan-2014 23:37:10]  <ponicalica> that's actually not that bad for 7d6
[05-Jan-2014 23:37:38]  <IllFlower> I dunno, E(7 dice) is 24.5
[05-Jan-2014 23:38:18]  <IllFlower> anyway, I'll start.
[05-Jan-2014 23:38:54]  <Hibiki> time to see if my criminal justice history helps me now
[05-Jan-2014 23:39:32]  <IllFlower> "Miss Hibiki Wakahisa," the man at the head of the tribunal asks, "you're here to make your case for reinstatement as a Conservator of the Magical Order."
[05-Jan-2014 23:40:50]  <IllFlower> he clears his throat. "having admitted to the wrongs that you've committed, what makes you believe you are fit to return to service?"
[05-Jan-2014 23:41:17]  <IllFlower> (I know this is vague, let me know if it's too much so.) raise 45, leave 24479X. **
[05-Jan-2014 23:42:01]  <Hibiki> (what goes over the specific of talky conflicts?)
[05-Jan-2014 23:42:54]  <IllFlower> general rules start on page 54. you can say basically whatever you want, but it should go with your dice, more or less.
[05-Jan-2014 23:43:46]  <IllFlower> this is collaborative to some extent, so if you can't think of something awesome to punctuate your high-dice raise right off the bat, that's okay, haha.
[05-Jan-2014 23:43:49]  <ponicalica> Also, keep in mind that you can bring in traits and relationships.
[05-Jan-2014 23:44:19]  <Hibiki> hmm
[05-Jan-2014 23:44:24]  <Hibiki> I figure I'd bring that up later
[05-Jan-2014 23:44:32]  <Hiiragi> "By the graces of Motherland Russia I — no, We — simply cannot let this stand…"
[05-Jan-2014 23:44:41]  <IllFlower> yeah. for instance, her betrayers might be in the audience, so you can roll 1d8 because that relationship is caught up in what happens.
[05-Jan-2014 23:44:56]  <Hibiki> Alright I'll try it out
[05-Jan-2014 23:45:10]  <Hibiki> my dice are shit so this is gunna be gud
[05-Jan-2014 23:45:31]  <IllFlower> in general, if you want to bring in a trait or relationship, just suggest it, and if nobody objects you're clear.
[05-Jan-2014 23:45:51]  <Hibiki> hmm

[05-Jan-2014 23:49:27]  <IllFlower> you have 1123346, as a reminder.
[05-Jan-2014 23:49:30]  <Hibiki> hmm
[05-Jan-2014 23:49:46]  <IllFlower> I raised 4+5 = 9.
[05-Jan-2014 23:50:17]  <Barcode> saying something like that seems like grounds for the d8, if you want to use it
[05-Jan-2014 23:50:28]  <Barcode> ("some of which have since been promoted")
[05-Jan-2014 23:50:34]  <IllFlower> yeah, almost certainly.
[05-Jan-2014 23:50:40]  <Hibiki> I figure that an ehye for details is appropiate
[05-Jan-2014 23:50:51]  <Rig> Not sure how that works here.
[05-Jan-2014 23:51:18]  <IllFlower> yeah, same. it's not directly applicable.
[05-Jan-2014 23:51:29]  <Barcode> you can use dice in future conflicts, btw.
[05-Jan-2014 23:51:42]  <IllFlower> not here.
[05-Jan-2014 23:51:49]  <Hibiki> I think I'd need to escalate

[05-Jan-2014 23:52:03]  <Barcode> oh i meant like, if he says "i pull in my relationship" it's not liek he can't pull in his relationship later in the game, just not again in this conflict
[05-Jan-2014 23:52:14]  <Hibiki> (how about my betrayers? I figure that relationship works)
[05-Jan-2014 23:52:21]  <Hibiki> but I feel that might come up later
[05-Jan-2014 23:52:24]  <IllFlower> yeah, that's the 1d8 we were mentioning.
[05-Jan-2014 23:52:34]  <IllFlower> you may as well just roll it now, no point in holding it back.
[05-Jan-2014 23:52:36]  <Hibiki> +roll 1d8
[05-Jan-2014 23:52:36]  <rollermine> Hibiki: (5)=5
[05-Jan-2014 23:52:39]  <Hibiki> cool
[05-Jan-2014 23:52:46]  <IllFlower> 11233456.
[05-Jan-2014 23:53:18]  <Hibiki> (to my understanding, I can see a verbal conflict right?)
[05-Jan-2014 23:53:30]  <IllFlower> you have to, in fact.
[05-Jan-2014 23:54:05]  <Hibiki> so I see with two dice, then raise with one of them?
[05-Jan-2014 23:54:17]  <Hibiki> oh no thats reveresing the blow
[05-Jan-2014 23:54:57]  <IllFlower> ordinarily, you see with two dice, then raise with another two.
[05-Jan-2014 23:55:19]  <Hibiki> so I'd see with 3 and 6 and raise with 5 and 4, for example?
[05-Jan-2014 23:55:22]  <IllFlower> yeah.
[05-Jan-2014 23:55:50]  <Rig> You can see with as many dice as you need/want.
[05-Jan-2014 23:56:15]  <Hibiki> but raising with more dice has more fallout?
[05-Jan-2014 23:56:24]  <Hibiki> yeah I see this hurr
[05-Jan-2014 23:56:58]  <Rig> Yeah, if you raise with 3 or more you take fallout.
[05-Jan-2014 23:57:30]  <Hibiki> I see with 3 6, raise with 5 4, seems like a safe thing to do, my character is being cautious
[05-Jan-2014 23:57:34]  <Hibiki> she doesn't have the best case
[05-Jan-2014 23:57:53]  <IllFlower> to clarify, you can *see* (respond) with more than two dice, but can only *raise* ("attack") with two.
[05-Jan-2014 23:58:23]  <IllFlower> okay. ordinarily you'd separately describe the raise, but I think impugning the dignity of the tribunal is enough of a raise ;)
[05-Jan-2014 23:58:29]  <Hibiki> (OOC, is it worth seeing with as high as possible)
[05-Jan-2014 23:58:40]  <Hibiki> (or do I want to have my raise)
[05-Jan-2014 23:58:44]  <IllFlower> depends on what you want to do in the narrative.
[05-Jan-2014 23:59:21]  <IllFlower> you can take fallout with a bad see if you want to save up for a cool raise later, for instance.
[05-Jan-2014 23:59:48]  <Barcode> also, you can try for "wearing down" your opponent rather than intending to hurt them, if you save your good dice for last or something.
[05-Jan-2014 23:59:49]  <IllFlower> there isn't really any "victory" separate from the one in-character.
[06-Jan-2014 00:00:06]  <Barcode> Yeah, taht's the big thing. yOu can win "who gets the bag of chips" and end up dead because of it.
[06-Jan-2014 00:00:11]  <IllFlower> anyway, I'll go ahead and see.
[06-Jan-2014 00:00:13]  <Barcode> (if you escalated it to a gunfight)
[06-Jan-2014 00:00:31]  <Hibiki> well I already used my good dice so we'll see
[06-Jan-2014 00:00:45]  <Rig> I'd like to see a fight over a bag of chips where everyone ends up dead.
[06-Jan-2014 00:01:06]  <Barcode> four way conflict, hmmmmm
[06-Jan-2014 00:01:26]  <IllFlower> "their conduct is not under question," one of the men off to the side says. "I'd prefer if you could stay on the subject of your own case for reinstatement." see 27.

[06-Jan-2014 00:04:47]  <IllFlower> another one of the council speaks up. "yes, you're doing yourself no favors. some of my colleagues wished to see you stripped of your magical abilities entirely, you are aware.

[06-Jan-2014 00:06:46]  <IllFlower> "let me rephrase the chief's question. how have you changed, Miss Wakahisa? what strides have you made to justify your return to the ranks of the Conservators?" raise 44, leave 9X. **

[06-Jan-2014 00:10:03]  <IllFlower> actually, you're in a pretty good position here. you just need to see 8, then raise 11 or higher.
[06-Jan-2014 00:10:07]  <Barcode> 3 6 3 is good, yeah
[06-Jan-2014 00:10:22]  <IllFlower> Hibiki: I was hoping you'd have an idea.
[06-Jan-2014 00:10:55]  <Hibiki> Just wanted to make sure you didn't have one in mind, I figure it was something generic that isn't super serious, but something requiring a demotion and reinstatement
[06-Jan-2014 00:11:08]  <IllFlower> nope, take the wheel.
[06-Jan-2014 00:11:11]  <Hibiki> maybe "Abusing powers of your station" or something like that
[06-Jan-2014 00:11:45]  <Hiiragi> ("A situation got out of control when it shouldn't have"?)
[06-Jan-2014 00:11:56]  <IllFlower> I was thinking civilian injuries somewhere.
[06-Jan-2014 00:11:58]  <Barcode> Hibiki: yeah, part of this game is sharing narrative power, even when it comes to the GM. as long as everyone likes it at least a little, you're good as gravy
[06-Jan-2014 00:12:10]  <Barcode> and i mean, this is also specific to your character.

Those individuals with a much stronger involvement than I received much lighter sentences, and since this court heavily factors in precedent, I simply wished to re-s
[06-Jan-2014 00:13:11]  <Hibiki> tate my understanding of the situation."
[06-Jan-2014 00:13:22]  <Hibiki> (test in the sense of I understand how this fangled RPing work)
[06-Jan-2014 00:14:43]  <IllFlower> RP-wise, that's fine. you didn't really address the question in the raise, though.
[06-Jan-2014 00:15:33]  <Rig> Yeah, that's not worth a block/dodge.
[06-Jan-2014 00:15:36]  <Rig> That'd be taking the blow.

[06-Jan-2014 00:26:28]  <Barcodrawing> i think it works. the court itself is the one making the decision, after all.
[06-Jan-2014 00:26:30]  <Hiiragi> (Nah it's fine, Rig just amused me.)
[06-Jan-2014 00:26:38]  <IllFlower> okay, you have 1123 left.
[06-Jan-2014 00:27:01]  <Rig> What do you have?
[06-Jan-2014 00:27:09]  <IllFlower> 9X.
[06-Jan-2014 00:27:09]  <IllFlower> I'm gonna say this isn't looking all that good.
[06-Jan-2014 00:27:15]  <Hibiki> for who
[06-Jan-2014 00:27:17]  <Barcodrawing> lol.
[06-Jan-2014 00:27:23]  <Hibiki> oh
[06-Jan-2014 00:27:29]  <IllFlower> Indiana Jones.
[06-Jan-2014 00:27:39]  <Barcodrawing> Hibiki: you'll lose, basically :P but no fear,  it won't end your character or whatever.
[06-Jan-2014 00:27:51]  <Hibiki> (I thought I was in a strong position though :V)
[06-Jan-2014 00:27:59]  <Hibiki> or is 9x bad
[06-Jan-2014 00:28:03]  <Rig> Not really. He's gonna reverse whatever you raise.
[06-Jan-2014 00:28:13]  <Rig> You should just throw yourself on the mercy of the court.
[06-Jan-2014 00:28:22]  <Rig> 9X is a 9 and a 10.
[06-Jan-2014 00:28:28]  <Hibiki> shit son
[06-Jan-2014 00:28:38]  <Hibiki> (I could give but that would be out of character)
[06-Jan-2014 00:28:50]  <Rig> We use X because our format would make 10 read as two numbers.
[06-Jan-2014 00:28:55]  <Hiiragi> She could give without actually giving.
[06-Jan-2014 00:29:01]  <IllFlower> yeah, you might have been better off seeing 233, taking some fallout, and then raising with 6 plus a trait you bring in.
[06-Jan-2014 00:29:19]  <Hibiki> I'll do that then
[06-Jan-2014 00:29:27]  <Hibiki> still its 19 I have to beat, right?
[06-Jan-2014 00:29:36]  <Hibiki> or just 10 and 9
[06-Jan-2014 00:29:59]  <IllFlower> just one of the two.
[06-Jan-2014 00:30:22]  <IllFlower> if you raise at least 11, I have no choice but to blow both of my dice on the see, and I have nothing to raise. thus I lose.
[06-Jan-2014 00:31:04]  *** SpruceZeus|away is now known as SpruceZeus
[06-Jan-2014 00:31:20]  <Hibiki> hmm
[06-Jan-2014 00:31:24]  <Hibiki> I'd have to get a 5 or better
[06-Jan-2014 00:31:43]  <Rig> I suppose it isn't in character to give.
[06-Jan-2014 00:32:01]  <ponicalica> you could escalate, that wouldn't be a terrible idea at all nosiree :P
[06-Jan-2014 00:32:06]  <IllFlower> you haven't rolled the 1d8 for "position of power."
[06-Jan-2014 00:32:16]  <IllFlower> exactly a 50% chance you roll 5 or better on that.
[06-Jan-2014 00:32:23]  <Hibiki> shit man
[06-Jan-2014 00:32:25]  <Hibiki> this is intense
[06-Jan-2014 00:32:34]  <Rig> Rollermine will fuck you up, son.
[06-Jan-2014 00:32:36]  <Rig> It's his job.

[06-Jan-2014 00:32:57]  <IllFlower> I dunno, when you guys were chasing down Kazuto it gave Barcodrawing a 6 of 6.
[06-Jan-2014 00:33:27]  <Barcodrawing> yeah, that was sweet.
[06-Jan-2014 00:33:31]  <Hibiki> shiit
[06-Jan-2014 00:33:37]  <Hibiki> so I Rp anything else or take the plunge?
[06-Jan-2014 00:34:02]  <IllFlower> if you want to take that die, go ahead and roll it.
[06-Jan-2014 00:34:15]  <IllFlower> are you going to see 233, then?
[06-Jan-2014 00:35:00]  <Hibiki> +roll 1d8
[06-Jan-2014 00:35:01]  <rollermine> Hibiki: (4)=4
[06-Jan-2014 00:35:02]  <Hibiki> fuck

[06-Jan-2014 00:35:24]  <Hiiragi> (Welp.)
[06-Jan-2014 00:35:31]  <Rig> So, you can RP losing or give.
[06-Jan-2014 00:35:42]  <IllFlower> Hibiki: it might be better to just give instead of taking the fallout from a 233 roll.
[06-Jan-2014 00:36:03]  <Hibiki> hmm
[06-Jan-2014 00:36:27]  <Rig> But taking the fallout would be in character.
[06-Jan-2014 00:36:36]  * Rig encourages people to take fallout always.
[06-Jan-2014 00:36:38]  <IllFlower> yeah, that is true.
[06-Jan-2014 00:36:41]  <Barcodrawing> lol.
[06-Jan-2014 00:36:43]  <Hiiragi> You can do both.
[06-Jan-2014 00:36:44]  <Hibiki> Is there anyway I can pull this out still?
[06-Jan-2014 00:36:53]  <Hiiragi> And still be in-character, all dramatic and such.
[06-Jan-2014 00:36:56]  <Rig> Not unless you just justify more traits?
[06-Jan-2014 00:37:01]  <IllFlower> not really. I don't see very many options.
[06-Jan-2014 00:37:05]  <Hibiki> I have to remember what traits
[06-Jan-2014 00:37:10]  <Barcodrawing> yeah you'd have to cheese extra traits and bleh

[06-Jan-2014 00:37:19]  <Rig> Yeah, there isn't much you can do.
[06-Jan-2014 00:37:21]  <Hibiki> I'm looking up that
[06-Jan-2014 00:37:23]  <Barcodrawing> fallout could be "I embarrassed myself in front of the council d4" or wahtever. if you don't want to do that you can give there, of course.
[06-Jan-2014 00:37:23]  <Rig> It's not like losing is bad.
[06-Jan-2014 00:37:55]  <Hibiki> Well its in character to fight until the bitter end, but wouldn't that related to my dad relationship?
[06-Jan-2014 00:37:59]  <Hibiki> i.e. the idea that losing is bad
[06-Jan-2014 00:38:12]  <Hiiragi> Yeah, says in the manual that you won't, like, be at a horrible loss for it if you do end up losing.

[06-Jan-2014 00:38:45]  <ponicalica> you get a d6 trait no matter what happens
[06-Jan-2014 00:38:50]  <IllFlower> Hibiki will take it hard, definitely, but sometimes that's how the situation goes down.
[06-Jan-2014 00:39:22]  <ponicalica> the fallout is its own thing but since this is a social-level conflict there's no risk of death
[06-Jan-2014 00:39:49]  <IllFlower> an additional 2d6 probably won't help even in this case, you'd have to see 19 starting with 1+1+4+6=12.
[06-Jan-2014 00:40:18]  <Hibiki> +roll 2d6
[06-Jan-2014 00:40:18]  <rollermine> Hibiki: (2+1)=3
[06-Jan-2014 00:40:22]  <Hibiki> yeah no I take it
[06-Jan-2014 00:40:52]  <IllFlower> okay, 3d4 fallout, then.
[06-Jan-2014 00:40:53]  <Hibiki> let it end
[06-Jan-2014 00:40:59]  <Hibiki> +roll 3d4
[06-Jan-2014 00:40:59]  <rollermine> Hibiki: (4+2+1)=7
[06-Jan-2014 00:41:30]  <Rig> Short term.
[06-Jan-2014 00:41:34]  <IllFlower> okay, one short-term consequence and one piece of experience fallout. those are listed on page 64.
[06-Jan-2014 00:41:36]  <Rig> And 1 experience.
[06-Jan-2014 00:41:48]  <IllFlower> in addition, you get a 1d6 trait relating to the initation experience.
[06-Jan-2014 00:42:13]  <IllFlower> "I hate being court-martialed 1d6" :p
[06-Jan-2014 00:42:46]  <Barcodrawing> yeah, "indignant d6" or something.
[06-Jan-2014 00:43:03]  <Hibiki> wait I got one
[06-Jan-2014 00:43:08]  <Hibiki> a one
[06-Jan-2014 00:43:29]  <Hibiki> so I get something good
[06-Jan-2014 00:43:49]  <IllFlower> yes.
[06-Jan-2014 00:44:07]  <Hibiki> hmm
[06-Jan-2014 00:44:11]  <Barcodrawing> good in the sense that it's worth a decent amoutn dice-wise, of course.
[06-Jan-2014 00:44:27]  <Hiiragi> You get a 1d6 whether you groin kick someone or lose in the courts.

[06-Jan-2014 00:46:00]  <Hiiragi> Yes.

[06-Jan-2014 00:46:10]  <IllFlower> page 66.
[06-Jan-2014 00:46:16]  <Barcodrawing> i think you can't get 8 or higher without weapons being involved?
[06-Jan-2014 00:46:20]  <Barcodrawing> or it's like a horrrrible roll
[06-Jan-2014 00:46:23]  <IllFlower> Hibiki: that's the list for when you have 1s.
[06-Jan-2014 00:46:41]  <IllFlower> 1 = experience fallout.
[06-Jan-2014 00:46:55]  <Hibiki> oh okay
[06-Jan-2014 00:46:56]  <IllFlower> Barcodrawing: you can get 8 if you're unlucky enough to roll 44 in a talky conflict.
[06-Jan-2014 00:47:09]  <IllFlower> so it's not all sticks and stones.

[06-Jan-2014 00:49:07]  <Hibiki> for my emotional fallout I'll add one d to being in a position of power is all I want, since I don't want to be in the position of having to do this again

[06-Jan-2014 00:49:31]  <IllFlower> "fuck accountability"
[06-Jan-2014 00:49:45]  <Hibiki> and for my new trait, I dunno, something to do with bureacracy or tenure

[06-Jan-2014 00:52:23]  <IllFlower> Hibiki: I'm not so sure if she's good at it, but certainly she can be someone who tries to.

[06-Jan-2014 00:52:45]  <Barcodrawing> final confrontation*

[06-Jan-2014 00:56:58]  <IllFlower> until then!
[06-Jan-2014 00:57:34]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[06-Jan-2014 00:57:46]  <Saladofstones> for a 1d4 trait how about "on the court's shit list for the short term"
[06-Jan-2014 00:57:56]  <Saladofstones> or assuming what happened, she is sour about being bailed out?
[06-Jan-2014 00:58:04]  <Rig> Doesn't seem like it has much a chance of coming up.

[06-Jan-2014 00:59:28]  <Rig> Hopefully our actual sessions move a bit quicker.
[06-Jan-2014 00:59:31]  <Saladofstones> as for the emotional fallout trait, I know it has to relate, but is it a bad trait per say?
[06-Jan-2014 00:59:40]  <Saladofstones> Rig: I know how this works now, so it should be smoother
[06-Jan-2014 01:00:13]  <Rig> Well, you get one from the experience fallout list and one from the initiation.
[06-Jan-2014 01:00:22]  <ponicalica> 16:54:01 < Hibiki> or "I will cut that claim into pieces!" <---lol
[06-Jan-2014 01:00:49]  <Rig> Maybe you meant the 1d4 to the 1d6 trait from initiation?
[06-Jan-2014 01:01:09]  <Alicia> Sometime next weekend (probably)…
[06-Jan-2014 01:01:25]  <Saladofstones> I get one for the fallout dice, one for rolling a one, and one for the initiation
[06-Jan-2014 01:01:28]  <Saladofstones> if I udnerstand this right
[06-Jan-2014 01:01:35]  <Saladofstones> no I'm dumb
[06-Jan-2014 01:01:43]  <Saladofstones> my fallout was the plus one dice
[06-Jan-2014 01:01:56]  <Rig> Okay, fallout is something different that the initiation trait.
[06-Jan-2014 01:02:03]  <Saladofstones> I understand that
[06-Jan-2014 01:02:05]  <Rig> You always get a 1d6 trait from initiation.
[06-Jan-2014 01:02:05]  <Saladofstones> I got it mixed up
[06-Jan-2014 01:02:18]  <Rig> It should be something related to what happened.
[06-Jan-2014 01:02:32]  <Rig> The 1d4 is a temporary detriment for having to take a blow.
[06-Jan-2014 01:02:50]  <Rig> You rolled a 1 when you rolled for fallout, so you get 1 experience thing.
[06-Jan-2014 01:03:30]  <Alicia> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8731765/Pictures%20and%20video/emoticons/indgnt.png I still have this open, Barcodrawing.

[06-Jan-2014 01:03:52]  <Alicia> :3
[06-Jan-2014 01:04:10]  <Rig> You said you wanted to up the number of dice for the position of power trait for your experience.
[06-Jan-2014 01:04:20]  <Rig> And IllFlower did that bit already it looks like.
[06-Jan-2014 01:04:54]  <Rig> So, you need some 1d6 trait that relates to losing your court thing.
[06-Jan-2014 01:05:41]  <Saladofstones> hmm
[06-Jan-2014 01:06:28]  <Alicia> How short is short-term?
[06-Jan-2014 01:06:34]  <Saladofstones> I think one conflict
[06-Jan-2014 01:07:16]  <Alicia> Ah.
[06-Jan-2014 01:07:30]  <Rig> Yeah.
[06-Jan-2014 01:07:44]  <Rig> The initiation trait is permanent though.
