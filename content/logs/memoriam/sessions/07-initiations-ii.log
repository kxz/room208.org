@time=2014-01-05T20:26:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well, there's a good tension there, between her principles (that say "no, I know I'm innocent") and her own personal pride (that says "but if I stand up I'm going to get knocked down a peg").

She's innocent, but its in the interest of everyone to minimize attention and damage, so s he's the fall guy
@time=2014-01-05T20:31:00.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :her conflict is that she didn't do it, but knew that she didn't have the pull to do anything and was given a good offer to take the hit

@time=2014-01-05T20:32:25.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Heh.
@time=2014-01-05T20:32:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I could see this being a "take the upstart down a notch" situation. either way, your relationships look fairly workable, flavor text aside.
@time=2014-01-05T20:34:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I wouldn't actually suggest "haughty 2d6" just because I actually used that for an NPC. hence the wink. :p
@time=2014-01-05T20:34:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but the general idea of being proud (and being proud of being a Conservator) works for a trait or two.
@time=2014-01-05T20:34:15.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Why not have her betrayal be a trait?
@time=2014-01-05T20:34:34.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"was betrayed" "took a fall for her ideals"
@time=2014-01-05T20:34:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Saladofstones: I remember you mentioned something about magic being a way to get out of the mundane life where she feels she can't do anything important?
@time=2014-01-05T20:35:14.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Illflower: yeah she was pretty aimless, and felt that there wasn't anythings he could do in ordinary life to fulfill her ambitions
@time=2014-01-05T20:35:44.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :its pretty important since that is why she's conflicted about taking the hit, she did sort of betray herself but the idea of losing megucahood would be worse than death to her
@time=2014-01-05T20:35:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"magic makes my life worth living" etc.
@time=2014-01-05T20:35:51.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also, 2d6 for soviet history puts soviet history as important for her as protecting people is to Jun.
@time=2014-01-05T20:35:59.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Which is fine.
@time=2014-01-05T20:36:40.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But something to consider.
@time=2014-01-05T20:36:55.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think given her personality, she might like american history more since muh self made man but soviet history, as a culture, does have the idea of a backwards agricultural nation becoming a major political force
@time=2014-01-05T20:39:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :it would be something interesting in talky conflicts.
@time=2014-01-05T20:39:22.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, but I don't think it's 2d6 worth of interesting.
@time=2014-01-05T20:39:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, I don't disagree with that.
@time=2014-01-05T20:39:51.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I altered it to 3d6 of magic is worth everything
@time=2014-01-05T20:39:58.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"    3d6 Better to suffer with magic than to thrive without it"
@time=2014-01-05T20:40:30.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I can live a 1d6 for soviet history
@time=2014-01-05T20:40:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, that's a trait I like. It defines the character and does something to explain why she'd rather be punished than be thrown out entirely.
@time=2014-01-05T20:40:43.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And yeah, 1d6 is good for soviet history.
@time=2014-01-05T20:41:09.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You really don't need to add flavor text for every trait.
@time=2014-01-05T20:42:24.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah I see that, it was making things too complicated
@time=2014-01-05T20:43:02.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, so, I still think being proud works as a trait.
@time=2014-01-05T20:43:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe proud of something in particular. Independence, being a conservator, something like that.
@time=2014-01-05T20:43:35.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She's proud of being in a position of authority, in specific, so of being a conservator
@time=2014-01-05T20:43:38.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :which is why getting demoted sucks
@time=2014-01-05T20:43:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she needs Conservatorship as a trait or relationship anyway, and this sounds like a perfect trait.
@time=2014-01-05T20:44:08.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so as a 1d8
@time=2014-01-05T20:44:21.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :that means is it stronger or weaker than a 2d8 trait?
@time=2014-01-05T20:44:35.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It means it's less important.
@time=2014-01-05T20:44:35.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :>finally get tenyruu
@time=2014-01-05T20:44:39.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :its glorious
@time=2014-01-05T20:45:17.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Basically, big dice size means they draw power from it.
@time=2014-01-05T20:45:19.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hmm
@time=2014-01-05T20:45:22.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Lots of dice means it's important.
@time=2014-01-05T20:45:33.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd say its important, but not as important as her having the position at all
@time=2014-01-05T20:45:35.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :not sure how to fram that
@time=2014-01-05T20:45:52.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think 1d8 is a good starting point for the trait.
@time=2014-01-05T20:47:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :if you think about it in terms of the conflict mechanics, both increasing the die size and number of dice will get you a higher total - but the latter means that to get the same total you'll need more dice, which means that your character has to take fallout.
@time=2014-01-05T20:48:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so more dice mean something that your character is willing to defend at high cost to herself; larger dice mean something that your character uses for (offensive) power, like Rig said.
@time=2014-01-05T20:50:59.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, we have a trait for being a Conservator, a trait for caring about magic, a trait for character fluff.
@time=2014-01-05T20:52:12.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And I think there is 1d8 and 2d6 left.
@time=2014-01-05T20:52:14.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think there shoudl be something related to her perceptive nature though
@time=2014-01-05T20:53:22.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How about just a trait like "an eye for details" or something?
@time=2014-01-05T20:55:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, that leaves 2d6.
@time=2014-01-05T20:56:44.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hmm
@time=2014-01-05T20:58:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: Have any ideas for traits?
@time=2014-01-05T20:58:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hm, let's see...
@time=2014-01-05T20:59:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :last time we fell back on elemental affinities, particular likes or dislikes, those sorts of things.
@time=2014-01-05T20:59:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I did use one of my traits to define magical flavor.
@time=2014-01-05T20:59:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, maybe she has some preferred method of fighting.
@time=2014-01-05T20:59:58.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she has tenure
@time=2014-01-05T21:00:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :lol.
@time=2014-01-05T21:00:09.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :uh
@time=2014-01-05T21:00:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I also included a school activity.
@time=2014-01-05T21:00:22.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :seriously though, I feel she's more of a magical investigator than anything else
@time=2014-01-05T21:00:27.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so perhaps something related to that
@time=2014-01-05T21:01:02.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"reads a lot of detective stories"
@time=2014-01-05T21:01:14.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"quotes Detective Dee frequently"

@time=2014-01-05T21:08:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :so is this ability one for reading the atmosphere, air elementalism, or some pun-based mix of the two?
@time=2014-01-05T21:08:50.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :mix of the two

@time=2014-01-05T21:13:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the Conservator relationship itself is fine, not sure about the description... might excise that since it seems in conflict with the personality we've already established.
@time=2014-01-05T21:14:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the friend relationship is a bit weird. if the friend is already distant, you'll have to justify how the relationship is still important in its present state.

@time=2014-01-05T21:16:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe the friend is simply just someone like who she wants to be? Then I can remove the distant bit.
@time=2014-01-05T21:16:35.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :that kind of gets close to hibiki's relationship with her dad

@time=2014-01-05T21:16:46.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :True, true.
@time=2014-01-05T21:17:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well, we have a fair few relationships that are like that.
@time=2014-01-05T21:17:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica's kinda got one (in an "I'll show you" kind of fashion).
@time=2014-01-05T21:18:18.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In this case it'd be a positive role model. Hibiki's all "I don't want to be like you," Hikari desperately wants to be like [friend] because of these ideals, so on for ponny.

@time=2014-01-06T00:50:32.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Bureaucracy sucks, I don't."
@time=2014-01-06T00:50:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I hate being asked intrusive questions 1d6"

@time=2014-01-06T00:52:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hibiki: I'm not so sure if she's good at it, but certainly she can be someone who tries to.

@time=2014-01-06T00:54:58.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's a good thing I put down Junpei instead of Barc Odey.
@time=2014-01-06T00:55:07.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It was fun flowers.
@time=2014-01-06T00:55:10.000Z :Hibiki PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So I don't know how I get shafted by the counsel?
@time=2014-01-06T00:55:46.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :oh yeah, don' flour gotta write somethign now
@time=2014-01-06T00:55:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hibiki: I'd play it out, ordinarily, but I'm running short on time.
@time=2014-01-06T00:56:06.000Z :Hibiki NICK Saladofstones
@time=2014-01-06T00:56:12.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In short: never trust salad as your legal defense
@time=2014-01-06T00:56:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :we'll schedule a first session sometime in the near future, probably next weekend.
@time=2014-01-06T00:56:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :we can address any lingering questions in the intervening time.
@time=2014-01-06T00:56:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :until then!
@time=2014-01-06T00:57:34.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hmm
@time=2014-01-06T00:57:46.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :for a 1d4 trait how about "on the court's shit list for the short term"
@time=2014-01-06T00:57:56.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :or assuming what happened, she is sour about being bailed out?
@time=2014-01-06T00:58:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Doesn't seem like it has much a chance of coming up.
@time=2014-01-06T00:58:29.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I like the one that's on there now.
@time=2014-01-06T00:58:39.000Z :Hiiragi PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I registered Hiiragi.

@time=2014-01-06T00:59:28.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hopefully our actual sessions move a bit quicker.
@time=2014-01-06T00:59:31.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :as for the emotional fallout trait, I know it has to relate, but is it a bad trait per say?
@time=2014-01-06T00:59:40.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: I know how this works now, so it should be smoother
@time=2014-01-06T01:00:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, you get one from the experience fallout list and one from the initiation.
@time=2014-01-06T01:00:22.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :16:54:01 < Hibiki> or "I will cut that claim into pieces!" <---lol
@time=2014-01-06T01:00:49.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe you meant the 1d4 to the 1d6 trait from initiation?
@time=2014-01-06T01:01:09.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sometime next weekend (probably)…
@time=2014-01-06T01:01:25.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I get one for the fallout dice, one for rolling a one, and one for the initiation
@time=2014-01-06T01:01:28.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :if I udnerstand this right
@time=2014-01-06T01:01:35.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :no I'm dumb
@time=2014-01-06T01:01:43.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :my fallout was the plus one dice
@time=2014-01-06T01:01:56.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, fallout is something different that the initiation trait.
@time=2014-01-06T01:02:03.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I understand that
@time=2014-01-06T01:02:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You always get a 1d6 trait from initiation.
@time=2014-01-06T01:02:05.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I got it mixed up
@time=2014-01-06T01:02:18.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It should be something related to what happened.
@time=2014-01-06T01:02:32.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The 1d4 is a temporary detriment for having to take a blow.
@time=2014-01-06T01:02:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You rolled a 1 when you rolled for fallout, so you get 1 experience thing.

@time=2014-01-06T01:03:49.000Z :Barcodrawing PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: it's still my face.
@time=2014-01-06T01:03:52.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness ::3
@time=2014-01-06T01:04:10.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You said you wanted to up the number of dice for the position of power trait for your experience.
@time=2014-01-06T01:04:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And IllFlower did that bit already it looks like.
@time=2014-01-06T01:04:54.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, you need some 1d6 trait that relates to losing your court thing.
@time=2014-01-06T01:05:41.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hmm
@time=2014-01-06T01:06:28.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How short is short-term?
@time=2014-01-06T01:06:34.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think one conflict
@time=2014-01-06T01:07:16.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ah.
@time=2014-01-06T01:07:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.
@time=2014-01-06T01:07:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The initiation trait is permanent though.
@time=2014-01-06T01:09:53.000Z :Rig QUIT :Quit: god doesn't know of the curses upon me
@time=2014-01-06T01:11:53.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Illflower: okay if I fill in the trait later?
@time=2014-01-06T01:11:55.000Z :Saladofstones PRIVMSG #madokamadness :my brain is dead
@time=2014-01-06T01:14:12.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-01-06T01:16:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ready for the next sessions. :D
@time=2014-01-06T01:17:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Session*, but that works.
