@time=2014-06-08T00:56:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Given that everything else Rin has maxes out at d8, the only way to get out of this without taking fallout is to roll 8 8. I try not to be too pushy, but Rin might want to reconsider her position!
@time=2014-06-08T00:59:21.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: of course, Rin would probably take the fallout.
@time=2014-06-08T01:02:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And thus Ayako and Hikari carry Rin to the nearest hospital/place to rest.
@time=2014-06-08T01:04:55.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But yeah I think Rin might want to just... take it.

@time=2014-06-08T01:26:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, might as well take the opportunity to work on everyone's outstanding fallout.
@time=2014-06-08T01:27:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia, you have a long-term item as well.
@time=2014-06-08T01:27:18.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Is that one long-term experience fallout, you mean.
@time=2014-06-08T01:27:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica, you get to pantomime brushing dirt off your shoulder like this was nothing.
@time=2014-06-08T01:27:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: No, experience and long-term fallout are two separate things.
@time=2014-06-08T01:28:01.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :one long term (11) plus one experience (rolled a 1)
@time=2014-06-08T01:28:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You can look at page 82 of the manual for the list.
@time=2014-06-08T01:29:13.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: I was thinking 1d4 ~~~> 2d4 cracks under conflict?
@time=2014-06-08T01:29:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hm, she took the fallout trying to defend Ayako, right?
@time=2014-06-08T01:29:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes.
@time=2014-06-08T01:30:11.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hm. So probably "1d4 reckless"?
@time=2014-06-08T01:30:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that's reasonable.
@time=2014-06-08T01:30:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or that as well.
@time=2014-06-08T01:30:35.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'll just add 1d4 reckless, then. It fits, especially given her follow up response to Michi.
@time=2014-06-08T01:30:47.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not to say she eas particularly convincing, but that's something else.
@time=2014-06-08T01:31:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha.
@time=2014-06-08T01:31:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Done.

@time=2014-06-08T01:31:59.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: I don't think anyone was particularly convincing arguing with Michi :p
@time=2014-06-08T01:32:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005?
@time=2014-06-08T01:32:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd take a look at that overkill trait for the long-term fallout. But that's just me.
@time=2014-06-08T01:33:44.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Fair point.
@time=2014-06-08T01:34:47.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :for the 1d4 trait, "Willing to go to extreme lengths to accomplish her goals (at the expense of all else)"?
@time=2014-06-08T01:35:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That sounds like the existing trait.
@time=2014-06-08T01:35:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You might just change that to a d4 trait from d6.
@time=2014-06-08T01:39:36.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ACTION has spent this time primarily going over situations in her head of how this would be afterwards.

@time=2014-06-08T01:52:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Something relationship-related seems apropos for the experience.
@time=2014-06-08T02:00:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anybody?
@time=2014-06-08T02:00:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Adding something related to Hikari or Ayako makes sense to me, since she actually worked like a team with them. Kind of.
@time=2014-06-08T02:02:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She tried.
@time=2014-06-08T02:02:56.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she provided air support
@time=2014-06-08T02:03:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That 1d4 with Ayako looks like a ripe target.
@time=2014-06-08T02:03:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako's just helping everyone today, isn't she.
@time=2014-06-08T02:04:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or you could add an (n+1)d6 relationship with Hikari or something.
@time=2014-06-08T02:07:43.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Reminds me, Hikari actually doesn't have many relationship dice, heh.
@time=2014-06-08T02:11:08.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A 2d6 relationship with Hikari, perhaps? (assigning one of two unassigned d6 and adding a d6 to it)
@time=2014-06-08T02:11:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sold.
@time=2014-06-08T02:12:33.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin made a friend!
@time=2014-06-08T02:12:44.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yay
@time=2014-06-08T02:12:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, we've gotta clear the scene, and we'll be all done.
@time=2014-06-08T02:13:38.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Cool.
@time=2014-06-08T02:15:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In the instant before her attack is to connect, Michi sees a look of panic flash across Rin's face. Her wand stops mere inches from the tip of Rin's nose.
@time=2014-06-08T02:16:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She stares into Rin's eyes, her breathing labored, as her mirror illusion collapses.
@time=2014-06-08T02:17:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Finally, Michi dematerializes the wand with a flick of her wrist.
@time=2014-06-08T02:18:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Please leave," she says, her gaze not once straying.
