[17-Jan-2014 23:04:45]  <IllFlower> Okay, why don't we get things started?
[17-Jan-2014 23:05:34]  <IllFlower> Last we left off, the girls had been talking to Chihiro about recent witch attacks on her friend Akiko.
[17-Jan-2014 23:06:40]  <IllFlower> Any unresolved questions before we move on?
[17-Jan-2014 23:06:53]  <ponicalica> I don't think so.
[17-Jan-2014 23:07:04]  <Rig> How do you expect me to keep these names straight?
[17-Jan-2014 23:07:16]  <ponicalica> he has a page with all the NPCs
[17-Jan-2014 23:07:23]  <IllFlower> Rig: Keep careful notes. This will be on the exam!
[17-Jan-2014 23:09:25]  <IllFlower> Give me a second to get my own notes together...
[17-Jan-2014 23:13:51]  <IllFlower> So under the girls' watchful eyes, a thankfully uneventful night passes.
[17-Jan-2014 23:14:06]  <IllFlower> Unless one of them was so eager to fight that she tried to draw the witch out of hiding or something.
[17-Jan-2014 23:14:23]  <IllFlower> Although I suspect nobody really wants to fight *that* badly.
[17-Jan-2014 23:15:17]  <ponicalica> I don't think so.  I don't even think Jun's that eager.
[17-Jan-2014 23:15:32]  <IllFlower> Well, then, Chihiro reports to the girls the following morning...
[17-Jan-2014 23:16:23]  <IllFlower> Looks like Jun's bed is turning into a conference room.
[17-Jan-2014 23:16:37]  <IllFlower> "She's awake," Chihiro says. "It looks like the operation went relatively well."
[17-Jan-2014 23:17:09]  <ponicalica> "Relatively?"
[17-Jan-2014 23:17:20]  <IllFlower> She opens her mouth as if to say something, but then closes it again, as if debating whether or not to say what she's thinking of.
[17-Jan-2014 23:17:43]  <IllFlower> Finally, given Ayako's prompting, she continues.
[17-Jan-2014 23:18:26]  <IllFlower> "Aki's not talking at all. Not a word. It's been four hours."
[17-Jan-2014 23:18:40]  <ponicalica> whoops, forgot about **, lol
[17-Jan-2014 23:18:53]  <IllFlower> Eh, whatever, haha.
[17-Jan-2014 23:18:55]  <IllFlower> **
[17-Jan-2014 23:19:54]  <ponicalica> brb bathroom
[17-Jan-2014 23:20:25]  <IllFlower> What timing.
[17-Jan-2014 23:20:39]  <Rig> I'll review the logs from last time to be sure I remember who did what and why.
[17-Jan-2014 23:21:54]  <ponicalica> back
[17-Jan-2014 23:22:37]  *** BGTB2005 <~BGT@pool-71-180-144-151.tampfl.fios.verizon.net> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 207 seconds)
[17-Jan-2014 23:22:54]  <ponicalica> Names with the -ko ending are female, right?
[17-Jan-2014 23:23:33]  <Hiiragi> "In any case, Jun's awake and with us, thankfully. Have the doctors said anything about her condition?"
[17-Jan-2014 23:23:52]  <IllFlower> Almost. "-hiko" is a male ending. Different character.
[17-Jan-2014 23:24:57]  <IllFlower> Hiiragi: "They've said that as far as they can tell, they didn't see any physical injuries that would cause that sort of thing. I heard the word 'aphasia' tossed around a couple of times."
[17-Jan-2014 23:26:01]  <ponicalica> **?
[17-Jan-2014 23:26:11]  <IllFlower> (The characters meet her and it turns out she has short hair, wears a kimono, and has crazy-colored eyes.)
[17-Jan-2014 23:26:30]  <IllFlower> Yeah, I'm not going to bother with ** for now. Just assume it's there.
[17-Jan-2014 23:26:37]  <Rig> Jun looks out the window. She's gotten tired of the view after all these weeks. "They think she can't talk because of a head injury?"
[17-Jan-2014 23:27:13]  *** BGTB2005 <~BGT@pool-71-180-144-151.tampfl.fios.verizon.net> has joined #madokamadness
[17-Jan-2014 23:28:03]  <ponicalica> "It's one of the more distressing side effects of witch attacks.  Supposedly the connections in the brain can get all scrambled up in there if the witch is powerful enough.  Depending on what gets broken up it can be really nasty."
[17-Jan-2014 23:28:53]  <IllFlower> Rig: "I don't know. It sounded like they were grasping for explanations."
[17-Jan-2014 23:29:35]  <IllFlower> Chihiro shuffles her feet. "I think Ayako has it, really."
[17-Jan-2014 23:30:42]  <Rig> "If we can't talk to her there isn't much we can do here."
[17-Jan-2014 23:31:32]  <jseblan> has it ever happened that you opened a bottle of soda with those old style metal pins and it popped out so strongly and loudly you hallucinated the cap hitting your face
[17-Jan-2014 23:32:15]  <jseblan> http://nutshelllivelifewell.com/content/dam/lclonline/images/products/FR2329209.png.thumb.420.420.margin.png that

[17-Jan-2014 23:32:20]  <ponicalica> Ayako hears hospital orderlies discussing soft drinks outside the hallway, but ignores them.  "Not quite.  There's a spell that can sometimes unscramble the connections long enough to communicate with the afflicted.  The downside is that it tends not to last for long, and that the images are often rather disturbing."
[17-Jan-2014 23:32:39]  *** jseblan <~chatzilla@CPEbcc81007908e-CMbcc81007908b.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has left #madokamadness
[17-Jan-2014 23:32:43]  <IllFlower> Rig: "Nothing? You can't do anything about it? Then is she just going to be like that until..."
[17-Jan-2014 23:33:44]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Emdogs | VIDEO GAMES: see Steam group (ask Barcode)
[17-Jan-2014 23:34:00]  <Hiiragi> "'Sometimes' unscrambles the connections, Ayako? And presumably, you know how to do this, too?" Hikari questions, trying not to get caught up in her own thoughts.
[17-Jan-2014 23:34:21]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: oshi continuity
[17-Jan-2014 23:34:21]  <Rig> "Ayako has some idea, but that involves getting into her hospital room alone long enough to cast some spell. It's risky." Jun sighs. "It could be worth it. The other option is trying to draw the witch to us."
[17-Jan-2014 23:34:35]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: yeah pretty much :D
[17-Jan-2014 23:35:38]  <IllFlower> Chihiro demurs. "So what do all of you think?
[17-Jan-2014 23:35:59]  <IllFlower> "I guess I'm not exactly eager to draw a witch out. You can understand."
[17-Jan-2014 23:36:47]  <Rig> Jun looks at the new girl. Her name was Hiiragi or Hirigana or something. "What do you think?"
[17-Jan-2014 23:37:35]  <ponicalica> "I'd want to at least try to get into the hospital room and untangle.  It's a risky proposition, but it's a lot safer than going head-on against a witch, especially one strong enough to do this to another initiate."
[17-Jan-2014 23:38:38]  <Hiiragi> Hikari thinks to herself for a moment. "I'm… not too sure. Taking on a witch, or more, is no easy feat, but the alternative isn't too good either… not without a guarantee of success."
[17-Jan-2014 23:39:13]  <IllFlower> A guarantee of success? In this godforsaken setting?
[17-Jan-2014 23:39:35]  <Rig> Jun sighs. "Well, if you want to get into Aki's room you're going to need a distraction."
[17-Jan-2014 23:40:10]  <Rig> "I think I can provide that since I can't very well wander the hospital."
[17-Jan-2014 23:40:43]  <IllFlower> "Twelve-Second Senpai^W Hospital Orderly"
[17-Jan-2014 23:40:44]  <IllFlower> If only Barcode were here.
[17-Jan-2014 23:40:48]  <Rig> Heh.
[17-Jan-2014 23:40:59]  <ponicalica> hitomi would make an excellent distaction
[17-Jan-2014 23:41:21]  <IllFlower> Chihiro nods, mostly going along with the flow.
[17-Jan-2014 23:41:58]  <Rig> "You guys should go wait near Aki's room. In a few minutes I'll cause a distraction that should get enough attention that you can get in. How much time do you need?"
[17-Jan-2014 23:43:08]  <ponicalica> "It really depends on how successful the spell is.  The more information we have, the better, really."
[17-Jan-2014 23:43:27]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Thank you for remembering, haha.
[17-Jan-2014 23:43:45]  <IllFlower> What kind of information were you thinking?
[17-Jan-2014 23:44:47]  <IllFlower> (Also, I just realized that witches technically don't manifest according to our setting materials until we reach 5d10 demonic influence, i.e. murder. Might have had to rethink that if we wanted to draw the witch out, haha.)
[17-Jan-2014 23:45:22]  <Rig> Hehehe.
[17-Jan-2014 23:46:02]  <IllFlower> (Either that, or "We must sacrifice the blood of the innocent to draw forth the witch!" and a black metal soundtrack.)
[17-Jan-2014 23:47:01]  <ponicalica> I'm actually not 100% sure, considering how little we know about Akiko.  Probably more info on Akiko and what she was doing.  Maybe Alicia should lead if/when we make conversation since Chihiro's supposed to be Hikari's friend?
[17-Jan-2014 23:48:10]  <IllFlower> Hm, yeah. That'd be a decent start. Gotta be able to figure out when you've hit the right memories...
[17-Jan-2014 23:49:41]  <Hiiragi> "Are you sure you can go at it alone, Jun? You may be well, but if you and I caused a distraction, once we get more information, it'd be bbeter than just… one person risking their life. We an regroup, too, if we get to doing something with this."
[17-Jan-2014 23:50:08]  <Rig> "It's not like I'm going to risk my life for this distraction. It's hospital orderlies."
[17-Jan-2014 23:50:29]  <Rig> "Besides, I'm sure Ayako could use help with the spell."
[17-Jan-2014 23:50:49]  <Rig> ((Jun is later murdered by hospital orderlies))
[17-Jan-2014 23:51:07]  <ponicalica> "It's probably better for you to come with me, Hikari, since you're more familiar with Chihiro and Akiko than I am, and it's always good when fighting witches to have three of us..."
[17-Jan-2014 23:51:20]  <ponicalica> s/fighting witches/something something magic
[17-Jan-2014 23:51:37]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: "Right, let me tell you what I know, then...
[17-Jan-2014 23:52:11]  <IllFlower> "Apparently she was found unconscious in an alley downtown last night.
[17-Jan-2014 23:52:28]  <Hiiragi> "True, Ayako. And if those are no longer an issue…" She trails off, imagining how things could go down.
[17-Jan-2014 23:52:55]  <IllFlower> "I'm not sure if she got called out on an assignment or something, because I'd been talking to her earlier, and she'd told me she was at home.
[17-Jan-2014 23:53:11]  <IllFlower> "Or maybe the witch dragged her away, I'm not sure..."
[17-Jan-2014 23:55:39]  <IllFlower> I think once we're done here we can jump into whatever we're doing for the attack plan. I imagine there'll be some conflict involved.
[17-Jan-2014 23:56:32]  <Rig> Yeah, I was thinking that Jun would have a conflict with the orderlies to keep them distracted.
[17-Jan-2014 23:56:40]  <ponicalica> I figured Jun would distract and then we'd go perform the spell and then try to get information.  I don't know what all you would want to be a conflict
[17-Jan-2014 23:56:50]  <Rig> Two conflicts at once!
[17-Jan-2014 23:56:57]  <Hiiragi> Awesome.
[17-Jan-2014 23:57:10]  <ponicalica> heh, I figured they'd be sequential, for IllFlower's benefit if nobody else's...
[17-Jan-2014 23:57:11]  <IllFlower> Rig: I was thinking of that, but I'm not sure the mechanics of simultaneous conflict would work so well, haha.
[17-Jan-2014 23:57:25]  <IllFlower> The stakes would be rather complicated.
[17-Jan-2014 23:57:26]  <Rig> Nah, but we can do them sequentially. Jun's conflict first.
[17-Jan-2014 23:57:47]  <IllFlower> Okay. Let's do that. Jun's raise first, I'd say.
[17-Jan-2014 23:58:10]  <Rig> One moment.
[17-Jan-2014 23:58:22]  <IllFlower> I'll roll 2d10 for demonic influence, since demonic attacks are the most we've seen.
[17-Jan-2014 23:59:08]  <Rig> Shall we say that the arena we're starting in is talking?
[17-Jan-2014 23:59:23]  <IllFlower> Hm, I might add in a couple of d6s to make that even, especially since the orderlies are technically a group.
[17-Jan-2014 23:59:26]  <IllFlower> Any objections?
[17-Jan-2014 23:59:30]  <Hiiragi> No.
[17-Jan-2014 23:59:30]  <Rig> Yeah, I'd be okay with that.
[17-Jan-2014 23:59:34]  <ponicalica> No objection.
[17-Jan-2014 23:59:40]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yeah, whatever you please, since Jun's the one initiating.

[18-Jan-2014 00:01:31]  <IllFlower> I imagine the other three girls hurry out of the room so as not to be too obvious.
[18-Jan-2014 00:01:44]  <Rig> Yeah, I was gonna describe that in my raise.
[18-Jan-2014 00:01:52]  <ponicalica> Yeah, we probably don't want to be there when Jun gets going.

[18-Jan-2014 00:04:41]  <Rig> With the plans set Jun waits for the girls to leave and then gives them another few minutes to get close enough before she starts her distraction. She knows that it'll have to be something loud enough to get attention all the way in Aki's room. She reaches out to the machine monitoring her heartbeat and pushes her palm flat against the metal casing. There is a brief flash of purple light before the machine starts sputtering 
[18-Jan-2014 00:04:41]  <Rig> sparking. In moments there is enough noise that Jun has to cover her ears.

[18-Jan-2014 00:07:01]  <IllFlower> One of the orderlies comes rushing into the room.
[18-Jan-2014 00:07:08]  <IllFlower> She looks at Jun, then the machine, as if she's seen this many times before.

[18-Jan-2014 00:08:46]  <Hiiragi> Passive-aggressiveness.
[18-Jan-2014 00:08:50]  <ponicalica> Scolding?
[18-Jan-2014 00:08:52]  <Rig> I dunno. All my knowledge comes from Scrubs.
[18-Jan-2014 00:09:00]  <Rig> Is my orderly Zach Braff?
[18-Jan-2014 00:09:05]  <IllFlower> "send in the Janitor"
[18-Jan-2014 00:09:10]  <ponicalica> The Japanese equivalent of Zach Braff.
[18-Jan-2014 00:09:18]  <Rig> It's actually just Zach Braff.
[18-Jan-2014 00:09:25]  <Rig> He's the same in every culture.
[18-Jan-2014 00:09:32]  <ponicalica> ("Zach Braff, doing a television commercial.")
[18-Jan-2014 00:10:50]  <Hiiragi> Scolding or asking what's up with Jun, yeah.
[18-Jan-2014 00:11:02]  <ponicalica> well, if he/she knows that Jun did it, lol
[18-Jan-2014 00:11:06]  <IllFlower> Well, that'd really work more in Jun's favor, haha.
[18-Jan-2014 00:11:13]  <IllFlower> Since it draws one of them off to work with her.

[18-Jan-2014 00:12:07]  <IllFlower> Hm, I think I've got one.
[18-Jan-2014 00:12:17]  <IllFlower> As the orderly leaves, a doctor stops her in the hallway.
[18-Jan-2014 00:13:17]  <IllFlower> "Ah, miss, do you have a second? Can you check on Akiko Yanase? Room 1218? Or get someone to check on her? I tried calling the floor but no one picked up."

[18-Jan-2014 00:14:51]  <Rig> I'll remember this sometime.
[18-Jan-2014 00:15:24]  <IllFlower> I'll print 3x5 "Omnipresence Dice Command Cheat Sheet" index cards.
[18-Jan-2014 00:15:46]  <ponicalica> included in every atashi sticker purchase
[18-Jan-2014 00:18:20]  <Rig> Ugh, having trouble thinking of a way to see something that has so little connection to Jun.
[18-Jan-2014 00:18:47]  <IllFlower> Screaming is always an option.
[18-Jan-2014 00:18:57]  <Rig> Isn't that a raise though?
[18-Jan-2014 00:19:11]  <IllFlower> Hm, yeah, you'd be right.
[18-Jan-2014 00:19:27]  <Rig> I have an idea, but it still feels like a raise.
[18-Jan-2014 00:19:43]  <Rig> I think the problem is that there is very little for Jun to actually react to in your raise.
[18-Jan-2014 00:19:54]  <IllFlower> Fair enough.
[18-Jan-2014 00:20:27]  <IllFlower> I was just going to say that you could see and raise with the same action but different rolls, haha.
[18-Jan-2014 00:20:33]  <Rig> Okay.
[18-Jan-2014 00:20:36]  <Rig> I can do that.
[18-Jan-2014 00:20:38]  <IllFlower> Play the mechanics a bit.
[18-Jan-2014 00:21:14]  <IllFlower> You're right that the stakes are unusual, though.
[18-Jan-2014 00:22:18]  <Rig> Jun panics slightly. Hospital machinery having a melt down while attached to a patient should have been more worrisome. As the nurse turns toward Akiko's room Jun takes a risk. Just below the orderly's footfall she creates a magic shield and then yanks it away. "Sorry," Jun whispers as the nurse tumbles backward into the doctor.

[18-Jan-2014 00:23:00]  <Rig> Works for you, IllFlower?
[18-Jan-2014 00:23:15]  <Rig> Or I can split out a separate raise. I have another idea that builds on that one.
[18-Jan-2014 00:23:35]  <IllFlower> Hahaha, that seems like an escalation to physical.
[18-Jan-2014 00:23:42]  <Rig> True, it does.
[18-Jan-2014 00:23:59]  <Rig> I can roll more dice if you want?
[18-Jan-2014 00:24:04]  <Rig> I'm not sure what you'd do. ¬.¬
[18-Jan-2014 00:24:26]  <Rig> Okay, let me try this one more time.
[18-Jan-2014 00:24:33]  <IllFlower> Mm, nah, it's okay, I don't need to be at an even further disadvantage. :p
[18-Jan-2014 00:24:48]  <Rig> One moment. Lemme swap it up.
[18-Jan-2014 00:24:57]  <IllFlower> Sure.
[18-Jan-2014 00:24:59]  <Rig> @dice add 7 1 3 4

[18-Jan-2014 00:26:44]  <Rig> Jun panics as the orderly starts to head toward Akiko's room. "Hey!" she shouts. The doctor and nurse pause and look at her. "Your machine just went on the fritz and almost killed me and you're just gonna unplug it and leave it here!" Jun tries to look pitiable (which isn't hard after being on bed rest for however long she's been here). "Shouldn't you at least check on me?"
[18-Jan-2014 00:26:57]  <Rig> @dice use 5 2

[18-Jan-2014 00:27:23]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Used 3 = 3. Bank now has 1 7 = 8.

[18-Jan-2014 00:27:37]  <Rig> 5 + 3 = 8
[18-Jan-2014 00:28:45]  <IllFlower> Hm, I have a mildly unorthodox plan.
[18-Jan-2014 00:29:06]  <IllFlower> I'll see 2 3 5, then give, holding onto the 5 for the next conflict with Ayako and the others.
[18-Jan-2014 00:29:16]  <IllFlower> Instead of raising.
[18-Jan-2014 00:29:37]  <IllFlower> As a kind of reflection of the fact that there's added danger since if something goes wrong nobody will be around to notice.
[18-Jan-2014 00:29:37]  <Rig> Okay, but if I win then they should also get something as a bonus for me being an adequate distraction, right?
[18-Jan-2014 00:29:54]  <IllFlower> Oh, hm, you have a point.
[18-Jan-2014 00:30:04]  <ponicalica> Isn't there a protocol with fallout on demonic influence?
[18-Jan-2014 00:30:23]  <ponicalica> since we don't care about random orderlies taking fallout
[18-Jan-2014 00:30:47]  <IllFlower> Yeah, we roll fallout and you get the two highest dice for your side.
[18-Jan-2014 00:30:58]  <ponicalica> although it's d4s, lol
[18-Jan-2014 00:31:03]  <IllFlower> Yeah, exactly.
[18-Jan-2014 00:31:07]  <Rig> Yeah, but that's fine.
[18-Jan-2014 00:31:27]  <IllFlower> Okay, I'll play out that scenario, then?
[18-Jan-2014 00:31:30]  <Rig> Sure.
[18-Jan-2014 00:31:32]  <ponicalica> sure
[18-Jan-2014 00:31:35]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi?
[18-Jan-2014 00:31:40]  <Hiiragi> Yep.
[18-Jan-2014 00:31:45]  <Rig> Rules are flexible for reasons
[18-Jan-2014 00:32:45]  <IllFlower> The orderly doesn't seem all that bothered by Jun's remarks, but the doctor looks crestfallen. He starts asking the orderly what's happened, in a very concerned tone. It looks like this is a conversation they'll be wrapped up in for a while.
[18-Jan-2014 00:32:59]  <IllFlower> @dice use 2 3 5
[18-Jan-2014 00:32:59]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 2 3 5 = 10. Bank now has 5 = 5.
[18-Jan-2014 00:33:09]  <IllFlower> Give, keeping 5, taking 3d4 fallout...
[18-Jan-2014 00:33:16]  <IllFlower> @dice roll 3d4
[18-Jan-2014 00:33:16]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 1 1 4 = 6.
[18-Jan-2014 00:33:34]  <ponicalica> lol, 1 4
[18-Jan-2014 00:33:39]  <Rig> Split the two highest between Hiiragi and Ayako, I think?
[18-Jan-2014 00:34:06]  <IllFlower> We'll just keep them in a pool and either one of them can draw on it whenever they feel like.
[18-Jan-2014 00:34:11]  <Rig> Okay.
[18-Jan-2014 00:34:14]  <Hiiragi> Mm.
[18-Jan-2014 00:34:18]  <IllFlower> 1 4 isn't that hard to remember, hopefully. :p

[18-Jan-2014 00:35:20]  <IllFlower> That's "no whammies," man.
[18-Jan-2014 00:35:27]  <IllFlower> People say "big money" on, like, every game show.
[18-Jan-2014 00:35:30]  <ponicalica> Yeah.  "Big money, no whammies".

[18-Jan-2014 00:36:01]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's move on to the follow-up conflict.
[18-Jan-2014 00:36:55]  <IllFlower> ponicalica, Hiiragi, I think one of you guys will raise first this time as well.
[18-Jan-2014 00:37:14]  <ponicalica> Alright.  Which stakes are this and at what level?
[18-Jan-2014 00:37:37]  <Rig> The stakes would be something about information.
[18-Jan-2014 00:38:24]  <ponicalica> Well, I mean, is it at the stage where I try to open the channel or what :V
[18-Jan-2014 00:38:29]  <IllFlower> That they're able to dispel the curse for long enough to talk to Aki, I'd say.
[18-Jan-2014 00:39:01]  <IllFlower> I imagine you'd start off with a spell of some sort?
[18-Jan-2014 00:39:33]  <ponicalica> Probably.  Which level will this be?
[18-Jan-2014 00:39:51]  <Rig> Physical, not fighting?
[18-Jan-2014 00:39:54]  <IllFlower> Oh, right. Let's go for physical for now. I think that's consistent with the last time we did this.
[18-Jan-2014 00:39:57]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[18-Jan-2014 00:40:07]  <Rig> So, Body and Heart.
[18-Jan-2014 00:40:15]  <IllFlower> You're not directing the magic *at* anyone, at least not yet.
[18-Jan-2014 00:40:38]  <Hiiragi> And Hikari, I'm guessing, tries to make sure nothing fouls this up.

[18-Jan-2014 00:41:30]  <IllFlower> Hiiragi: Yeah, Rig said it.

[18-Jan-2014 00:45:04]  <ponicalica> I'll raise first.
[18-Jan-2014 00:45:27]  <IllFlower> Go ahead.
[18-Jan-2014 00:47:05]  <Hiiragi> (1d8, 1d10, 2d6?)
[18-Jan-2014 00:48:05]  <IllFlower> Hiiragi: Hm? Your Body and Heart total 6d6.
[18-Jan-2014 00:48:20]  <Hiiragi> Oh, oh wait yeah.

[18-Jan-2014 00:48:54]  <Hiiragi> Hm.
[18-Jan-2014 00:49:44]  <ponicalica> Ayako opens up her notebook and marks down a rune circle for her desired spell on a nearby blank whiteboard, as she begins to recite the first lines of the same.  
[18-Jan-2014 00:50:06]  <ponicalica> @dice use 3 5

[18-Jan-2014 00:50:40]  <IllFlower> I think I'll go for raise order by high die - ponicalica, Hiiragi, me. In spite of the fact that this puts me at a rather strong disadvantage, haha.
[18-Jan-2014 00:50:54]  <IllFlower> So I'll see here and then Hiiragi can raise.
[18-Jan-2014 00:51:19]  <Hiiragi> Mm.
[18-Jan-2014 00:51:49]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: What's this part of the spell intended to do?
[18-Jan-2014 00:52:12]  <IllFlower> Anything is fine, I just need something more concrete to write a good see.
[18-Jan-2014 00:52:21]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Make Akiko able to talk, I guess.
[18-Jan-2014 00:52:24]  <ponicalica> oops :V
[18-Jan-2014 00:53:02]  <IllFlower> Maybe something like give the curse form, so that it can be comprehended.
[18-Jan-2014 00:53:37]  <ponicalica> That's a good one, yeah.  :\
[18-Jan-2014 00:53:42]  <ponicalica> sorry for being a bad roleplayer :P
[18-Jan-2014 00:54:01]  <IllFlower> Nothing to worry about, man.
[18-Jan-2014 00:55:14]  <IllFlower> The curse begins to take form as a black fog, which inconveniently rises up to the ceiling and blots out the lights, thereby negating some of the purpose of making it visible in the first place...

[18-Jan-2014 00:56:36]  <IllFlower> These dice are pretty miserable, so I think this conflict's going to be over soon, haha.
[18-Jan-2014 00:57:00]  <IllFlower> One of these days I'll get 6 6 6 6 10 10, just you wait!
[18-Jan-2014 00:58:02]  <Hiiragi> Hiiragi moves herself in front of Ayako, preparing for whatever the curse will do.

[18-Jan-2014 00:58:27]  <IllFlower> Hiiragi: You have to raise so that I have something to respond to.
[18-Jan-2014 00:58:48]  <IllFlower> I can't see something that's not properly directed at the curse.
[18-Jan-2014 00:59:11]  <Hiiragi> Oh right.
[18-Jan-2014 01:00:42]  <IllFlower> Who knows, she could wave a giant fan around to dispel the mist.
[18-Jan-2014 01:01:12]  <IllFlower> Super Smash Dogs.
[18-Jan-2014 01:01:24]  <ponicalica> Hibiki could use her air power to dispel the mist of course
[18-Jan-2014 01:01:40]  <IllFlower> "air power"
[18-Jan-2014 01:01:57]  <IllFlower> A squadron of bombers drops ordnance onto the hospital.
[18-Jan-2014 01:02:23]  <ponicalica> I hope that's not your raise/see
[18-Jan-2014 01:02:26]  <IllFlower> I have a feeling Hibiki would love that.
[18-Jan-2014 01:02:34]  <Hiiragi> "How about you make yourself useful and leave, before we force you out of here." Hikari growls, while batting away the mist.
[18-Jan-2014 01:02:55]  <IllFlower> Hahaha, that works for me...
[18-Jan-2014 01:02:58]  <Hiiragi> I kind of want to use another, I'm not sure if 9 is enough…
[18-Jan-2014 01:03:04]  <Hiiragi> enough for me*
[18-Jan-2014 01:03:09]  * Rig pictures a cat.
[18-Jan-2014 01:03:10]  <ponicalica> raises are always two dice
[18-Jan-2014 01:03:13]  <IllFlower> Dude, I can't see 9 with two dice, I think that's plenty.
[18-Jan-2014 01:03:21]  <Hiiragi> Boo. ;p
[18-Jan-2014 01:03:24]  <Hiiragi> Right.
[18-Jan-2014 01:04:19]  <IllFlower> Actually, yeah, wow. I can... see 2 2 5 and then raise 1 1. lol.
[18-Jan-2014 01:04:42]  <IllFlower> This is pretty dire.
[18-Jan-2014 01:05:15]  <Hiiragi> And if you speak back, Hikari will probably punch the mist anyway so lol.
[18-Jan-2014 01:05:30]  <Hiiragi> (Nothing else, course.)

[18-Jan-2014 01:14:37]  <IllFlower> It unleashes a loud, piercing scream...
[18-Jan-2014 01:14:40]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Yeah, go ahead.
[18-Jan-2014 01:14:58]  <IllFlower> Make it as cool as you want.
[18-Jan-2014 01:15:33]  <Hiiragi> Ayako can magic it up.
[18-Jan-2014 01:15:38]  <Hiiragi> first*
[18-Jan-2014 01:18:10]  <IllFlower> I suggest Solar Beam.
[18-Jan-2014 01:18:31]  <IllFlower> "Go, Venusaur!"
[18-Jan-2014 01:19:24]  <ponicalica> Ayako briefly covers her ears, then lets out her own scream.  "MENTEM SOLVE!"  The runes on the whiteboard seem to shift, as do the ones on her costume.  The lights overhead flicker, then unleash a directed blast at the vaguely canine figure, overwhelming it with light.
[18-Jan-2014 01:21:14]  <ponicalica> (I wonder how butchered something with a /lv/ or /lw/ would end up from a Japanese speaker though...)

[18-Jan-2014 01:22:42]  <IllFlower> The creature bursts into flames as the light hits it, and soon is no more.
[18-Jan-2014 01:23:02]  <Hiiragi> Hikari draws away from the lights, startled, looking to Ayako. "Ayako, we're good! She's safe!"
[18-Jan-2014 01:23:35]  <IllFlower> Akiko bolts out of unconsciousness, coughing up a storm.
[18-Jan-2014 01:24:09]  <IllFlower> "Who... who are you?" she asks in shock, upon seeing Ayako and Hikari.
[18-Jan-2014 01:24:45]  <IllFlower> Well, at least it looks like she has her voice back.
[18-Jan-2014 01:25:47]  <ponicalica> Ayako whispers to Hikari: "We don't quite know that yet.  The sort of attack that requires mentem solvere tends to leave scars..."
[18-Jan-2014 01:28:57]  <Hiiragi> "I see, er, right…" Hikari mutters back, before returning to her regular tone and supporting Akiko. "I'm Hiiragi, Chihiro might have mentioned me before. You're fine, we're friends here." Hikari smiles, glancing at Ayako.
[18-Jan-2014 01:30:21]  <IllFlower> "I-I'm Yanase..." Akiko speaks, trembling.
[18-Jan-2014 01:30:47]  <IllFlower> "You're Conservators, aren't you? I recognize the crest..."
[18-Jan-2014 01:31:36]  <IllFlower> It's as if she's just woken from a terrible nightmare. Which maybe she has, in a sense.
[18-Jan-2014 01:32:44]  <ponicalica> The crest as in what Ayako put on the whiteboard or do Conservators have a common costume design element?
[18-Jan-2014 01:33:12]  <IllFlower> The latter.
[18-Jan-2014 01:34:27]  <IllFlower> Someone might want to get Chihiro, speaking of her. I imagine she's been waiting outside while Ayako and Hikari got their work done in here.
[18-Jan-2014 01:35:34]  <ponicalica> Ayako steps to the door and opens it, calling Chihiro in while Hikari talks to Akiko.
[18-Jan-2014 01:36:53]  <IllFlower> Akiko's eyes go wide upon seeing her friend walk into the room. "Chihiro..."

[18-Jan-2014 01:38:40]  <IllFlower> Akiko looks, for her part, as confused as ever.
[18-Jan-2014 01:39:28]  <IllFlower> "What's happening? What *happened*? Why is everyone...?"
[18-Jan-2014 01:42:05]  <ponicalica> Hiiragi: you still here?
[18-Jan-2014 01:42:23]  <Hiiragi> "Well, I'd love to give you a straight answer to that, but we're not doing too well for answers either, Akiko." Hikari replies, her smile turning into a frown.

[18-Jan-2014 01:43:48]  <IllFlower> "Hold on, hold on," Chihiro says, stepping in on behalf of her friend.
[18-Jan-2014 01:44:08]  <IllFlower> She's obviously a bit put off by Hikari's blunt method of questioning.
[18-Jan-2014 01:44:56]  <ponicalica> the dilemma here is that Ayako has terrible social skills, but Hikari also has terrible social skills.  (Jun's the one here with more than 3d6 Ht.)
[18-Jan-2014 01:45:29]  <IllFlower> Just your luck that she's not here. `_`
[18-Jan-2014 01:46:36]  <IllFlower> Akiko mumbles to herself quietly, thinking out loud. She seems caught up in piecing together what Hikari's just said, too caught up to take offense. Or perhaps she just has more patience.
[18-Jan-2014 01:46:56]  <ponicalica> Can we hear what she's saying? :P
[18-Jan-2014 01:46:58]  <IllFlower> "Hiiragi?" she finally says, as if to confirm that that was in fact the name she was given.

[18-Jan-2014 01:48:12]  <Hiiragi> "Yep, that's me." Hikari replies casually, trying to brush off any awkwardness.

[18-Jan-2014 01:55:59]  <Hiiragi> "But we have time to get the answers now, don't we? At least now Akiko is with us."
[18-Jan-2014 01:57:37]  <Hiiragi> "After all, we were able to dispel the curse."
[18-Jan-2014 01:58:43]  <IllFlower> We should fast-forward to the crew's suspicions that someone's been sending witches after her.

[18-Jan-2014 02:00:04]  <ponicalica> (probably bureaucracy slowing down her reinstatement)

[18-Jan-2014 02:57:59]  <IllFlower> We'll pick up from here. ponicalica, Ayako's question about Toshi was relevant, so I'll make sure it gets addressed next time.
