@time=2014-11-09T21:22:14.000Z :IllFlower TOPIC #madokamadness :https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Orlando
@time=2014-11-09T21:22:36.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What.
@time=2014-11-09T21:22:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We left off with the Conservators talking to Miho and Ishigaki.
@time=2014-11-09T21:23:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So we now know where Karasuma might be. What say you all?
@time=2014-11-09T21:23:51.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let's go turn him into paste?
@time=2014-11-09T21:24:29.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How about we don't do that.
@time=2014-11-09T21:24:40.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Search him out and see if he's actually been being a big jerk?
@time=2014-11-09T21:24:41.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :let's find him and not turn him into paste unless we absolutely have to
@time=2014-11-09T21:24:54.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :okay we'll subdue him and then Hikari can handcuff him
@time=2014-11-09T21:24:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :First let's put the idea of paste out of our heads entirely
@time=2014-11-09T21:26:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't like paste anyway.
@time=2014-11-09T21:27:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We were going to the arcade, right?
@time=2014-11-09T21:28:10.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think so, yeah
@time=2014-11-09T21:28:19.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: can't handcuff paste?
@time=2014-11-09T21:28:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sadly, no.
@time=2014-11-09T21:28:38.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :clearly not trying hard enough
@time=2014-11-09T21:28:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm making an effort towards improving my Handcuff Game, okay
@time=2014-11-09T21:28:58.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Her too)
@time=2014-11-09T21:29:00.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ANYWAY
@time=2014-11-09T21:29:06.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Arcade, yes, sounds fine.
@time=2014-11-09T21:30:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, let's do that.
@time=2014-11-09T21:31:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The arcade isn't all that busy when the Conservators arrive, but neither is it all that empty.
@time=2014-11-09T21:31:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That being said, the machines are definitely making most of the noise.
@time=2014-11-09T21:32:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A man about Kazuki's age is manning the front desk, looking a little bored.
@time=2014-11-09T21:33:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Karasuma isn't immediately visible, though the place is a bit of a maze.
@time=2014-11-09T21:33:51.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :start looking around for Karasuma?
@time=2014-11-09T21:33:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki is about to ask the group if they want to split up to find him, but he catches himself thinking what would happen if Rin found him first.
@time=2014-11-09T21:34:41.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the arcade would probably end up on fire
@time=2014-11-09T21:34:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We know what Karasuma looks like, right?
@time=2014-11-09T21:34:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.
@time=2014-11-09T21:34:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Several civilian casualties.
@time=2014-11-09T21:34:57.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :if it helps any, she hasn't met him before so she doesn't know what he looks like
@time=2014-11-09T21:35:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Someone showed you a picture somewhere along the way.
@time=2014-11-09T21:35:34.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Let's see if we can find him," Kazuki says. "And let's stick together."
@time=2014-11-09T21:35:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or rather, showed Rin.
@time=2014-11-09T21:35:44.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she has a vague idea of what he looks like
@time=2014-11-09T21:37:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki starts to lead the group down one of the corridors of flashing machines.
@time=2014-11-09T21:37:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :As they make their way to the back of the arcade, Hikari notices that one of the service doors is unlocked and slightly ajar. Muffled but distinct sounds of some kind of argument leak through the gap.
@time=2014-11-09T21:39:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Does Hikari kick down the door and start arresting people?
@time=2014-11-09T21:40:39.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari stops, motioning to the others to listen in.
@time=2014-11-09T21:40:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: She's not that bad about it, man
@time=2014-11-09T21:41:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki stops and tries to listen over the noise of the games.
@time=2014-11-09T21:42:24.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako backs up to listen in, behind Hikari
@time=2014-11-09T21:44:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sorry, making things up on the fly here.
@time=2014-11-09T21:44:20.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin joins the others, trying to focus on the sounds on the other side of the door
@time=2014-11-09T21:45:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"... the hell you decide to come back for, then?" a male voice shouts.
@time=2014-11-09T21:46:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Then another: "What? You own this arcade or something?"
@time=2014-11-09T21:47:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You know damn well what you did wrong."
@time=2014-11-09T21:47:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah. Absolutely nothing. I don't need your permission."
@time=2014-11-09T21:48:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There's a sudden, dull sound of something heavy hitting the wall. Probably a person.
@time=2014-11-09T21:49:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Then the first voice again: "You keep on thinking that.
@time=2014-11-09T21:50:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Come on, let's go."
@time=2014-11-09T21:50:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The Conservators hear the sound of footsteps approaching the door.
@time=2014-11-09T21:50:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki makes to look like he's involved in some game involving jets and explosions.
@time=2014-11-09T21:51:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He tries to keep the door in his peripheral vision without being too obvious.
@time=2014-11-09T21:51:35.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako quickly follows Kazuki's lead, though she's probably way worse at convincing people she's actually playing while the demo mode runs
@time=2014-11-09T21:51:36.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari, meanwhile, absentmindedly plays with her phone behind Kazuki.
@time=2014-11-09T21:51:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The door very nearly opens into Rin's face.
@time=2014-11-09T21:52:29.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She tries to take a few pictures while in position, and makes idle chatter with Kazuki.
@time=2014-11-09T21:52:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Two boys come striding out of the back, neither of whom is Karasuma, looking very annoyed.
@time=2014-11-09T21:52:54.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Jumping back quickly, Rin attempts to look innocent
@time=2014-11-09T21:53:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari catches a glimpse of someone crumpled against the wall in the corridor beyond before the door shuts.
@time=2014-11-09T21:54:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin, for her part, gets a nasty glare from the departing boys.
@time=2014-11-09T21:54:10.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We should check on the person when the boys are gone.
@time=2014-11-09T21:54:55.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-11-09T21:55:00.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-11-09T21:55:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You that desperate?" one of the boys says dismissively.
@time=2014-11-09T21:55:25.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Agreed.)
@time=2014-11-09T21:56:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Apropos of nothing, you folks should figure out when your characters' birthdays are. Anyway.
@time=2014-11-09T21:56:56.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think I already mentioned when Rin's was?
@time=2014-11-09T21:56:56.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Has it been a year in-game since we started?  If so, Ayako's probably 17 now
@time=2014-11-09T21:57:20.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari's is on July 16th.
@time=2014-11-09T21:57:24.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness : /canon

@time=2014-11-09T21:57:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Somewhere between 7 and 9 months.

@time=2014-11-09T21:57:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ANYWAY LET'S KEEP MOVING SHALL WE
@time=2014-11-09T21:58:46.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin was born May 1, 1997
@time=2014-11-09T21:59:10.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :mayday
@time=2014-11-09T21:59:56.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shall we check on that person?
@time=2014-11-09T22:00:01.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :also incidentally three years to the day Ayrton Senna died
@time=2014-11-09T22:00:18.000Z :Buttercupistiny PRIVMSG #madokamadness :illflower derailed this train, man
@time=2014-11-09T22:00:43.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Birthdays! Panic.
@time=2014-11-09T22:00:57.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :After briefly rummaging through her bag for bandages and such, Hikari whispers to Kazuki about having gotten a few, albeit bad, pictures.
@time=2014-11-09T22:01:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Getting little reaction from Rin, the boys move on, not noticing the other Conservators much at all.
@time=2014-11-09T22:01:18.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thank god, they could have made Ayako cry.
@time=2014-11-09T22:01:20.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just in case they would need to return to them as well.
@time=2014-11-09T22:01:27.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And then it'd be the end for us all.
@time=2014-11-09T22:01:39.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :D:
@time=2014-11-09T22:02:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Soon the pair disappears out of sight behind the banks of machines.
@time=2014-11-09T22:03:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki tries the door, hoping it is still unlocked.
@time=2014-11-09T22:03:41.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :if it's locked Ayako has a key :p
@time=2014-11-09T22:04:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's open.
@time=2014-11-09T22:04:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari should probably rush in first, since she's the one who say the person.
@time=2014-11-09T22:06:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari opens the door to find, as she thought, Karasuma still leaning unsteadily against the wall.
@time=2014-11-09T22:06:27.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What a twist!?
@time=2014-11-09T22:06:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not really.
@time=2014-11-09T22:06:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I know.
@time=2014-11-09T22:06:55.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, looks like he's been pasted already. Rin's job is done for her.
@time=2014-11-09T22:07:13.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :next objective: track the two boys down?
@time=2014-11-09T22:07:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm having the NPCs corner the market on violence this arc.
@time=2014-11-09T22:07:29.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :First we should probably figure out what the hell happened to him.
@time=2014-11-09T22:08:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Karasuma looks up to see who's entered. His only reaction to Hikari is a quizzical raising of his eyebrows.
@time=2014-11-09T22:09:26.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki follows close behind, mildly surprised to find their "bully" being served some of his own medicine.
@time=2014-11-09T22:09:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :As the other Conservators enter the hallway, Karasuma finally speaks.
@time=2014-11-09T22:10:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"There some kind of party going on here?"
@time=2014-11-09T22:10:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He asks like he doesn't really care about the answer.
@time=2014-11-09T22:10:28.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We were here to figure out what...you...were doing."
@time=2014-11-09T22:10:57.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari begins taking out her bandages, ignoring the question. "Where were you hurt?"
@time=2014-11-09T22:10:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And who the hell are you?"
@time=2014-11-09T22:12:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Might I remind you that having strangers suddenly come in and attend to your wounds is a little weird.
@time=2014-11-09T22:12:20.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well, at least you're still lucid..." she mutters.
@time=2014-11-09T22:12:35.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: I assumed he got dun wasted? Or is it just a little beat up?
@time=2014-11-09T22:12:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shouldn't he recognize most of them?
@time=2014-11-09T22:12:52.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :didn't he have a run in with Ayako and Hikari before?
@time=2014-11-09T22:13:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He could have forgotten.
@time=2014-11-09T22:13:10.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :True.
@time=2014-11-09T22:13:17.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hmm, yeah
@time=2014-11-09T22:13:26.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :also he might've been beat up enough that he can't really tell atm
@time=2014-11-09T22:13:31.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :concussion or something
@time=2014-11-09T22:13:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And plus if he's thrashed, figures he'd not immediately recognize - yeah.
@time=2014-11-09T22:13:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He doesn't appear to recognize either of them. I'd wager his mind is elsewhere at the moment.
@time=2014-11-09T22:14:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What I'm trying to say is, goddamn it would it kill you guys to introduce yourselves?
@time=2014-11-09T22:14:14.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I did it last session!
@time=2014-11-09T22:14:29.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That doesn't matter. You're obviously hurt, and I can introduce myself after you're more lucid. Now, where are you hurt?"
@time=2014-11-09T22:14:30.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: if Ayako says her own name the witch comes out (ok not really but)
@time=2014-11-09T22:14:32.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki isn't the girl trying to bandage up every wounded guy she sees.
@time=2014-11-09T22:14:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: So I see you would rather we let him bleed out, or pass out.
@time=2014-11-09T22:14:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :If you say Ayako's name three times fast into a mirror, a magical girl somewhere loses her head.
@time=2014-11-09T22:15:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't think he was hurt that bad.
@time=2014-11-09T22:15:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He's not actually hurt that badly.
@time=2014-11-09T22:15:22.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay then never mind that, guh. Misunderstood what you meant by beat up.
@time=2014-11-09T22:15:41.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or rather, to what extent. >_>
@time=2014-11-09T22:15:42.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :See, when most people confront people they don't set them on fire and throw them through six plate glass windows.
@time=2014-11-09T22:15:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Would someone care to explain to Karasuma what's going on?
@time=2014-11-09T22:16:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Because Karasuma is currently very confused and more than a little defensive.
@time=2014-11-09T22:16:00.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: Well, fair
@time=2014-11-09T22:16:15.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We've been looking for you. We're Conservators of the Order," Kazuki says.
@time=2014-11-09T22:16:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Cue the revelation that Karasuma doesn't know what that means.
@time=2014-11-09T22:17:05.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Cue him assuming we're a bunch of thugs.
@time=2014-11-09T22:17:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Stunned silence and a split screen shot as each member of the team reacts to that fact that Karasuma has no magic at all anymore.
@time=2014-11-09T22:17:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Karasuma makes an exasperated sound.
@time=2014-11-09T22:17:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Are you fucking with me?"
@time=2014-11-09T22:18:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki pauses, wonder if this is a trick question.
@time=2014-11-09T22:18:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"No?"
@time=2014-11-09T22:18:21.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :*wondering
@time=2014-11-09T22:19:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The boy lolls his head backwards, staring at the ceiling.
@time=2014-11-09T22:19:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What do you want?"
@time=2014-11-09T22:20:59.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari smiles. At least he's being a little helpful. "Kazuki, would you please."she asks, stepping away from him towards the door.
@time=2014-11-09T22:21:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm not sure if this really counts as "helpful," but okay.
