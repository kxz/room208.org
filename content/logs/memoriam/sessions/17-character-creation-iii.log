[19-Apr-2014 20:16:50]  <Alicia> Yup.

[19-Apr-2014 20:18:03]  <ponicalica> don't you remember morning rescue
[19-Apr-2014 20:18:07]  <IllFlower> As usual, we'll be just going down the list of steps in the rulebook. Which means that the first step is to pick a background.
[19-Apr-2014 20:18:51]  <ponicalica> @g rozpacz >! what is this, polish?

[19-Apr-2014 20:19:57]  <IllFlower> We've got a Strong History character (Ayako) and a Strong Community character (Hikari). I think we could use some complication, but maybe that's just me. :D
[19-Apr-2014 20:20:48]  <BGTB2005> "socially vulnerable", is this good for a relatively quiet individual?
[19-Apr-2014 20:21:29]  <Barcode> i actually kinda wonder what that means
[19-Apr-2014 20:21:36]  <Barcode> like, the cops are after you? you have vendettas against you?
[19-Apr-2014 20:21:37]  <IllFlower> "Socially vulnerable" means growing up in rough circumstances, essentially.
[19-Apr-2014 20:21:46]  <Barcode> oh, more likely to go into crime then?
[19-Apr-2014 20:22:01]  <Barcode> (er sorry. just finished my coffee...now)
[19-Apr-2014 20:22:49]  <IllFlower> The character couldn't count on there being any support in the wider community. Falling through the cracks and ending up a criminal is one way it could turn out, yes.
[19-Apr-2014 20:23:31]  <Barcode> ah.
[19-Apr-2014 20:23:37]  <IllFlower> That being said, we are talking about Conservators, so that particular wave can't have swallowed them whole.
[19-Apr-2014 20:24:20]  <IllFlower> Oh, I suppose I should toss in a link to the character sheet for convenience: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AizHQ9KT342udEN1Q0ZxT1liX0FyVDdVRkNSdXcxc1E

[19-Apr-2014 20:25:01]  <ponicalica> Hitomi sort of fell on that side a bit, I think, i.e. she was a bit of a delinquent
[19-Apr-2014 20:25:30]  <IllFlower> I do kind of miss her willingness to solve problems by throwing a fist at them.
[19-Apr-2014 20:25:32]  <BGTB2005> I'm thinking, maybe she was picked on a lot growing up?
[19-Apr-2014 20:26:11]  <IllFlower> Hm, yeah, that would fit Complicated Community.
[19-Apr-2014 20:26:18]  <BGTB2005> i dont know what im doing
[19-Apr-2014 20:26:32]  <Barcode> well, you know me, not good with arbitrary grinder stories :V
[19-Apr-2014 20:26:43]  <IllFlower> The way I've explained this before is that Complicated Community is for growing up in trouble, and Complicated History is for having *been* the trouble.

[19-Apr-2014 20:29:56]  <BGTB2005> should i paste in her name?
[19-Apr-2014 20:30:14]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that's fine.
[19-Apr-2014 20:30:32]  <ponicalica> I suspect that BGT is leaning towards the former given that he mentioned a relatively quiet character
[19-Apr-2014 20:30:50]  <Alicia> Nice name.
[19-Apr-2014 20:30:53]  <IllFlower> Are you settled on a background? If you're stuck, picking arbitrarily is as good an option as any.
[19-Apr-2014 20:31:18]  <BGTB2005> I think i'll go with complicated community
[19-Apr-2014 20:31:28]  <IllFlower> Amamiya, hm.
[19-Apr-2014 20:31:47]  <ponicalica> out of curiosity, what's the meaning of the characters?
[19-Apr-2014 20:32:22]  <IllFlower> "rain palace, phosphorus"
[19-Apr-2014 20:32:30]  <BGTB2005> explanation for her name?
[19-Apr-2014 20:33:00]  <BGTB2005> "Amemiya" is taken from the rotary engine tuner, "Rin" from the Touhou character
[19-Apr-2014 20:33:16]  <Alicia> Knew It.
[19-Apr-2014 20:33:24]  <ponicalica> ah, heh
[19-Apr-2014 20:33:32]  <ponicalica> "Rin" mostly makes me think of Fate/stay night, lol
[19-Apr-2014 20:34:38]  <IllFlower> Oh, it's Amemiya, whoops. VOWEL CHANGES

[19-Apr-2014 20:35:19]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Anyway, if you have Complicated Community, this gives you 15 in stats to divide between the four green columns.
[19-Apr-2014 20:35:37]  <IllFlower> You have to have at least 2 in each, but otherwise go wild.

[19-Apr-2014 20:36:50]  *** Zia_ is now known as Zia
[19-Apr-2014 20:36:57]  <IllFlower> There's an explanation of what each of the stats is for on pages 23 and 24.
[19-Apr-2014 20:37:15]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: None of that "power of love" rubbish, obv.
[19-Apr-2014 20:37:59]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: well the only player to have >3 Ht in this whole campaign kinda died, so...
[19-Apr-2014 20:38:23]  <Alicia> 3, 4, 3, 2.
[19-Apr-2014 20:38:25]  <Alicia> 2*
[19-Apr-2014 20:39:01]  <Alicia> Amused Hikari's isn't higher, but it kind of makes sense I guess.
[19-Apr-2014 20:39:13]  <IllFlower> Love makes you weak!
[19-Apr-2014 20:39:44]  <IllFlower> All you need is magic and the ability to beat that magic into other people's skulls!
[19-Apr-2014 20:40:20]  <Alicia> Oh, right.
[19-Apr-2014 20:40:28]  <Alicia> That's why Hikari's stats are the wya htey are.
[19-Apr-2014 20:40:31]  <Alicia> way* they*
[19-Apr-2014 20:40:43]  <ponicalica> Alicia: btw I think you have your experience/reflection to do as well
[19-Apr-2014 20:40:45]  <BGTB2005> magical combat replaces gun fighting, yes?
[19-Apr-2014 20:40:49]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: yeah
[19-Apr-2014 20:41:29]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Yesh.
[19-Apr-2014 20:41:30]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Okay, from these stats, it looks like you're going for a physical character with a good head and a fair bit of magical ability, but not so possessed of social graces. Perhaps because she's not ever willing to back down from anything, haha.
[19-Apr-2014 20:41:34]  <IllFlower> Sound about right?
[19-Apr-2014 20:41:46]  <Alicia> 4/4/2/5.
[19-Apr-2014 20:41:49]  <Alicia> Oh my.
[19-Apr-2014 20:41:54]  <ponicalica> though there's nothing that says you can't go full Homura/Kiritsugu and magically enhance regular guns, thus making them the same thing (except I don't think there are any civil war era guns used by either of those two)
[19-Apr-2014 20:42:08]  <BGTB2005> magical nuke
[19-Apr-2014 20:42:12]  <Alicia> Lol.
[19-Apr-2014 20:42:25]  <IllFlower> I am a *tad* worried about the low collective Ht, but to say anything more would be spoiling it.
[19-Apr-2014 20:42:44]  <ponicalica> Analogue: A Ht Story
[19-Apr-2014 20:43:25]  <IllFlower> It might be less of a problem, group balance-wise, if you play it as brusqueness rather than mere shyness.
[19-Apr-2014 20:44:17]  <ponicalica> group collective will towards playing barely social nerds :p
[19-Apr-2014 20:44:30]  <IllFlower> We are kind of lacking for a character who's willing to speak her mind, gracefully or no.
[19-Apr-2014 20:45:12]  <Alicia> Hey now, Hikari just needs to work on her tact!
[19-Apr-2014 20:45:44]  <BGTB2005> ...maybe reassigning a die or two towards Ac?
[19-Apr-2014 20:46:09]  <IllFlower> Any particular reason?
[19-Apr-2014 20:46:22]  <ponicalica> I think he's trying to do wrt speak her mind gracefully or no
[19-Apr-2014 20:47:07]  <IllFlower> That seems more like a Wl thing.
[19-Apr-2014 20:47:35]  <IllFlower> Ac is closer to intelligence and perception.
[19-Apr-2014 20:47:58]  <IllFlower> What kicks in when you have to think fast, in other words.
[19-Apr-2014 20:51:25]  <IllFlower> If you're otherwise happy with the stats, we can go ahead and start working on traits.
[19-Apr-2014 20:53:44]  <BGTB2005> k
[19-Apr-2014 20:54:56]  <IllFlower> Any ideas to start with?
[19-Apr-2014 20:55:23]  <IllFlower> ("Is perfectly willing to kill you without saying a word 2d6")
[19-Apr-2014 20:56:50]  * Alicia glances at her character. Sees "brass knuckles." Smiles.
[19-Apr-2014 20:58:18]  <BGTB2005> I haven't figured a die budget yet, but maybe make her a fire elemental?
[19-Apr-2014 20:58:23]  <ponicalica> I guess one thing to keep in mind is hat our characters are going for, character-wise, and doing something that will have interesting interactions with that
[19-Apr-2014 20:58:34]  <ponicalica> hahaha, that would have an interaction with Ayako
[19-Apr-2014 20:58:58]  <BGTB2005> we have a light elemental and an (MIA) air elemental
[19-Apr-2014 20:59:13]  <Alicia> Who's the air elemental.
[19-Apr-2014 20:59:16]  <ponicalica> (Ayako hasn't exactly had good experience with fire.)
[19-Apr-2014 20:59:19]  <ponicalica> Alicia: salad's character
[19-Apr-2014 20:59:23]  <Alicia> Oh right.
[19-Apr-2014 20:59:43]  *** Rig <~Iverum@c-71-57-99-60.hsd1.in.comcast.net> has joined #madokamadness
[19-Apr-2014 20:59:44]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Rig
[19-Apr-2014 21:00:01]  <Alicia> Hikari has no elemental control.
[19-Apr-2014 21:00:19]  <ponicalica> ("fear of the elements" was originally "fear of fire" jsyk)
[19-Apr-2014 21:01:07]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that's right. I just moved an entire block of rows halfway down the table. BWAHAHAHAHA
[19-Apr-2014 21:01:20]  <Alicia> "I bet you bastards can't take *THIS*!" *Ayako freaks out in the distance* "DARN IT RIN STOP IT."
[19-Apr-2014 21:01:59]  <IllFlower> Rin's name does kinda prescribe fire.
[19-Apr-2014 21:02:21]  <IllFlower> That being said, there's no reason you could decide to make her a technetium elemental instead.
[19-Apr-2014 21:02:23]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: there's now a pair of rows near the bottom that now have no lines between jsyk
[19-Apr-2014 21:02:30]  <IllFlower> Couldn't, excuse me.
[19-Apr-2014 21:03:13]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Looks fine to me.
[19-Apr-2014 21:03:38]  <ponicalica> refreshed and never mind
[19-Apr-2014 21:04:03]  <IllFlower> Oh, you could make Rin a shadow elemental, for contrast's sake. That would be hilarious.
[19-Apr-2014 21:04:29]  <IllFlower> "Ayako, Rin, please stop playing magical tug-of-war."
[19-Apr-2014 21:04:31]  <BGTB2005> I think fire elemental's going to be more !!fun!!
[19-Apr-2014 21:05:03]  <BGTB2005> set the bad guy on fire...and half the neighbourhood
[19-Apr-2014 21:05:06]  <IllFlower> Oh, sure. This group's had some bad experiences with fire is all.
[19-Apr-2014 21:05:13]  <Alicia> I'm almost wishing I could make Hikari control something now.
[19-Apr-2014 21:05:16]  <Alicia> Buuut eh.
[19-Apr-2014 21:05:31]  <ponicalica> Alicia: if you could make it fit with the experience you've learned this arc, you can!
[19-Apr-2014 21:05:34]  <IllFlower> Hm, why is Hikari not the light elemental? Major oversight, that.
[19-Apr-2014 21:05:55]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: You still have 6d6 to assign.
[19-Apr-2014 21:05:59]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: irony
[19-Apr-2014 21:06:05]  <Alicia> IllFlower: I have no idea.
[19-Apr-2014 21:06:08]  <BGTB2005> trying to figure out what to do there
[19-Apr-2014 21:06:18]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Oh. Hmmmm.
[19-Apr-2014 21:06:19]  <IllFlower> Might be a good idea to come up with four or five traits and then assign dice to them afterwards.
[19-Apr-2014 21:06:34]  <IllFlower> Anything Rin particularly likes to do? Backstory...?
[19-Apr-2014 21:07:47]  <IllFlower> You can phrase traits as things like life events, as well as just straightforward statements of ability.
[19-Apr-2014 21:08:10]  <IllFlower> "Once caught a fish *thiiiiiis* big 2d6"
[19-Apr-2014 21:08:40]  <Alicia> Pfffft.
[19-Apr-2014 21:11:40]  <IllFlower> "Hates getting wet" // hahahaha, this is perfect.
[19-Apr-2014 21:11:53]  <Alicia> Giggle.
[19-Apr-2014 21:12:36]  <ponicalica> now IllFlower faces a dilemma: rephrase the quote to make it fit in the box, or expand the box
[19-Apr-2014 21:13:09]  <BGTB2005> Tends to use excessive force?
[19-Apr-2014 21:13:29]  <IllFlower> Don't worry about it. We can always go back and touch it up later. Or rather, I probably will.
[19-Apr-2014 21:13:41]  <ponicalica> there's a reason I said IllFlower faces the dilemma
[19-Apr-2014 21:14:28]  <IllFlower> There.
[19-Apr-2014 21:15:16]  <Alicia> "If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing" "Bad Community" "4/5 Bd/Wl" <~~~ Getting some overcompensation vibes here, BGTB2005.
[19-Apr-2014 21:15:36]  <IllFlower> Oh, hm, Rin has exactly the same stats as Hitomi.
[19-Apr-2014 21:15:46]  <Alicia> Hah. So she does.
[19-Apr-2014 21:16:08]  <ponicalica> ("You remind me of someone for some reason...")
[19-Apr-2014 21:17:17]  <IllFlower> Hm, any particular life events that would give Rin an affinity to fire? Or overdoing things?
[19-Apr-2014 21:17:54]  <BGTB2005> haven't actually thought the first through
[19-Apr-2014 21:18:37]  <ponicalica> I could see the second feeding into the first.  Fires can be pretty dramatic.
[19-Apr-2014 21:18:43]  <IllFlower> Free association is a good way to think of additional traits, is all.
[19-Apr-2014 21:19:16]  <BGTB2005> the latter, probably been pushed too far and basically went "I will fuck you up so thoroughly"
[19-Apr-2014 21:19:28]  <ponicalica> I'm also thinking about the bullying thing related to the second, but that's 1) something that might be a bit too psychopathic for a Conservator 2) more of a relationship
[19-Apr-2014 21:19:31]  <IllFlower> Oh, you also have to assign "Conservator" as either a trait or a relationship.
[19-Apr-2014 21:20:31]  <IllFlower> The former's if Rin uses her status for power in conflict, the latter's if that's what motivates her to enter conflict.
[19-Apr-2014 21:20:38]  <Alicia> While on this, could I take one of my 2d10s over to my 1d10 Conservator relationship?
[19-Apr-2014 21:20:42]  <IllFlower> "Fight using" vs. "fight for," essentially.
[19-Apr-2014 21:20:48]  <Alicia> Or is that a no-go because the traits already there, presumably.
[19-Apr-2014 21:21:37]  <IllFlower> I'm not sure if you can change existing relationships like that, so I'm going to say no.
[19-Apr-2014 21:21:48]  <Alicia> Makes sense.
[19-Apr-2014 21:21:52]  <Alicia> Just wanted to check.
[19-Apr-2014 21:24:05]  <IllFlower> I should mention that mechanics-wise a relationship's dice can't be used unless the relationship is at stake in the conflict somehow.
[19-Apr-2014 21:25:18]  <IllFlower> So in the case of the Conservators, either your character's status as a Conservator is under threat, or the opponent is a Conservator.
[19-Apr-2014 21:25:29]  <IllFlower> Hm, I think I just got an idea. /scribble
[19-Apr-2014 21:25:49]  <Alicia> :O
[19-Apr-2014 21:26:14]  <Rig> «Rozpacz»
[19-Apr-2014 21:26:15]  <Buttercupistiny> nemo having ideas usually doesn't bode well
[19-Apr-2014 21:26:49]  <IllFlower> "Loves cars" // ehehehehe
[19-Apr-2014 21:27:08]  <BGTB2005> especially the fire-spittign high-performance...
[19-Apr-2014 21:27:12]  <BGTB2005> hello rin are you me
[19-Apr-2014 21:27:19]  <BGTB2005> (yes)
[19-Apr-2014 21:28:37]  <IllFlower> Don't get too attached.
[19-Apr-2014 21:28:45]  * Rig cries.
[19-Apr-2014 21:28:55]  <IllFlower> I'm sure you know I have a penchant for doing terrible things to characters whose players get too attached to them.
[19-Apr-2014 21:29:53]  * Alicia only remembers so much of MBurst. Jun, however...
[19-Apr-2014 21:30:13]  * Alicia doesn't know of anything pre-MB, if anything.
[19-Apr-2014 21:30:33]  <BGTB2005> I think there are logs of older games
[19-Apr-2014 21:30:52]  <Alicia> Yeah. I just mean offhand.
[19-Apr-2014 21:31:39]  <ponicalica> unrelated to Rin's character creation: I'm still not sure what I want to do for my reflection/experience fallout but I do think I like the idea of reducing "Doesn't run from violence" to 1d4: "Doesn't run from violence (maybe even when she should)"
[19-Apr-2014 21:32:32]  <Alicia> "Doesn't know when to run away/give in."

[19-Apr-2014 21:33:57]  <IllFlower> Anything else you'd like to add as a trait?
[19-Apr-2014 21:35:03]  <IllFlower> The frankness or directness or shyness or whatever you were thinking might be something to put down.
[19-Apr-2014 21:35:19]  <IllFlower> Perhaps in a somewhat more detailed fashion than just that, but perhaps not.
[19-Apr-2014 21:35:20]  <BGTB2005> sure
[19-Apr-2014 21:35:43]  <IllFlower> "Plainspoken (in air quotes)"
[19-Apr-2014 21:36:50]  <Alicia> "Doesn't know when to fold 'em" <~~~ 'cause she's a defender of the West, crushin' all pretenders in the west, bad guy shouldn't mess with us 'cause we in the Wild Wild East.
[19-Apr-2014 21:37:08]  <IllFlower> All right, we can move on to relationships in this case.
[19-Apr-2014 21:37:29]  <IllFlower> You don't have to allocate all of your relationship dice at this very moment, though there should probably be enough to motivate her current situation.
[19-Apr-2014 21:38:43]  <Alicia> "Direct (blunt, plainspoken...)" Well she'll get along just fine with Hikari, eh.
[19-Apr-2014 21:39:44]  <BGTB2005> "Bullies 2d8" seem good?
[19-Apr-2014 21:39:51]  <IllFlower> Hm, Rin and Sumire might have something to talk about.
[19-Apr-2014 21:40:35]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: If Rin were to face those bullies now, would she feel empowered (by revenge, maybe) or vulnerable?
[19-Apr-2014 21:40:43]  <ponicalica> lol, i still have a highlight set on Sumire
[19-Apr-2014 21:41:37]  <Alicia> Random question but how old is Rin.
[19-Apr-2014 21:41:43]  <Alicia> I like knowing the age dynamics.
[19-Apr-2014 21:41:51]  <ponicalica> how old is Hikari again?
[19-Apr-2014 21:42:28]  <Alicia> 17.
[19-Apr-2014 21:42:40]  <ponicalica> I know Ayako was 16 during the first branch, and I don't think there was enough time between then and the second for her to turn 17, but maybe in the upcoming branch, lol
[19-Apr-2014 21:42:53]  <BGTB2005> Alicia: pfff I dunno; average high-school-girl aged?
[19-Apr-2014 21:43:03]  <IllFlower> it_is_a_mystery.gif
[19-Apr-2014 21:43:18]  <BGTB2005> 17?
[19-Apr-2014 21:43:34]  <ponicalica> make all of the characters 17 like they were all 15 in emburst
[19-Apr-2014 21:43:57]  <Alicia> Is Sumire an old character. Like, Zudak's, or.
[19-Apr-2014 21:44:19]  <ponicalica> sumire was my emburst char, lol
[19-Apr-2014 21:45:00]  <Alicia> Second-best guess. Go me.
[19-Apr-2014 21:46:09]  <Alicia> Would it be fine to put the characters ages next to their names, or something.
[19-Apr-2014 21:46:19]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: But yeah, if Rin would feel motivated by it somehow, d8 or d10 would be appropriate. If it would give her problems (she gets weak, or uncontrollably hot-headed), go d4. d6 is just "normal."
[19-Apr-2014 21:46:23]  * Alicia thinks there's room?
[19-Apr-2014 21:46:40]  <BGTB2005> re: bullies; i think she would feel motivated
[19-Apr-2014 21:47:48]  <IllFlower> All right. That's something to keep in mind about her character - how it would motivate her ("I'm past that now" vs. "MEMORY MAKES RIN RAGE DESTROY") is up to you...
[19-Apr-2014 21:47:57]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Also, that music rocks.
[19-Apr-2014 21:48:13]  <IllFlower> ("I'm past that now and I can prove it," rather)
[19-Apr-2014 21:50:09]  <IllFlower> Either way, that would probably play into another relationship - a friend she made who supported her, or someone she's at loggerheads with. Maybe even a friend she lost.
[19-Apr-2014 21:53:26]  * Alicia still isn't sure what to do with Junpei...
[19-Apr-2014 21:53:48]  *** Rig <~Iverum@c-71-57-99-60.hsd1.in.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Rig)
[19-Apr-2014 21:54:15]  <BGTB2005> I think I'll put some d4 on bullies and a d8 on the friend
[19-Apr-2014 21:56:34]  <BGTB2005> so interactions with bullies might invariably trend towards "CRUSH THEM", or would you say that would better fit the other d8?
[19-Apr-2014 21:56:45]  <ponicalica> Alicia: I think the one to do things with Junpei will really be IllFlower 
[19-Apr-2014 21:57:27]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Well, true. But I mean like, I'm looking back and am just hind of scratching my head. At least it's *something*, I guess.
[19-Apr-2014 21:57:29]  <ponicalica> like the only time I used Yurika it was to save Jun and I basically shoehorned it in there
[19-Apr-2014 21:57:48]  <Alicia> Mmmm.
[19-Apr-2014 21:57:54]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: If you were to make it a d4 relationship, she could still think "CRUSH THEM," but in a way that would make her more likely to lose control of herself or the situation.
[19-Apr-2014 22:01:42]  <IllFlower> I do think you should assign at least a couple of the d4s out of the gate, though, not least because they're a big part of what defines the Complicated Community background.
[19-Apr-2014 22:07:26]  <BGTB2005> ...I think I was supposed to come up with a name for this friend...
[19-Apr-2014 22:07:39]  <IllFlower> I can always make one up later.
[19-Apr-2014 22:07:58]  <ponicalica> illflower made up all the names for my backstory
[19-Apr-2014 22:08:00]  <IllFlower> None of the original PCs or their relations had names at first.
[19-Apr-2014 22:08:00]  <ponicalica> both times
[19-Apr-2014 22:08:17]  <IllFlower> Let's head on to assigning Rin's belongings.
[19-Apr-2014 22:09:12]  <IllFlower> So both of the current PCs have exactly one magical belonging (gun). It'd be interesting if Rin didn't have any. Or had two. (Or three!)
[19-Apr-2014 22:09:13]  <Alicia> You can't add brass knuckles Hikari's got'em.
[19-Apr-2014 22:09:16]  * Alicia huffs.
[19-Apr-2014 22:09:42]  <IllFlower> There are rules for assigning dice on pages 27 and 28.
[19-Apr-2014 22:14:30]  <IllFlower> "Portable chessboard 1d6"
[19-Apr-2014 22:14:57]  <BGTB2005> Could I give her "magical wings 1d8"?
[19-Apr-2014 22:16:01]  <IllFlower> That'd be interesting. You'd have to be able to justify Rin's having wings, though. And if they're magical they get an extra 1d4.
[19-Apr-2014 22:16:24]  <Alicia> Oh my.
[19-Apr-2014 22:16:37]  <ponicalica> Wings seems more like a costume element than a magical belonging to me
[19-Apr-2014 22:16:56]  <Alicia> BGT's taking a nice amount of.. inspirations. :p
[19-Apr-2014 22:17:04]  <Alicia> (Also no really, wings r awesome.)
[19-Apr-2014 22:17:39]  <IllFlower> Oh, and if they're d8 as opposed to d6, they'd need to be big wings. Like, capable of generating enough lift to raise a golf cart, maybe.
[19-Apr-2014 22:19:54]  <BGTB2005> while thinking about things before the session, I was imagining big enough for herself or to use as an emergency shield or something
[19-Apr-2014 22:20:19]  <BGTB2005> like to block an incoming fireball she can't dodge for whatever reason
[19-Apr-2014 22:20:23]  * Alicia imagines the Naruto v. Sasuke fight, pre-Shippuuden.
[19-Apr-2014 22:20:33]  * Alicia really liked Sasuke's wings.
[19-Apr-2014 22:20:58]  <IllFlower> Oh, if she uses them for defense like that, I think that's fine. In which case I'd drop the 1d4 as well.
[19-Apr-2014 22:21:16]  <ponicalica> By "magical belonging" I think he basically means "magical weapon".
[19-Apr-2014 22:21:40]  <ponicalica> since, well, it replaces gun
[19-Apr-2014 22:23:06]  <BGTB2005> for weapon maybe a 1d8+1d4 or 2d6+1d4 "fancy cannon"?
[19-Apr-2014 22:23:17]  <Alicia> :P
[19-Apr-2014 22:23:23]  <BGTB2005> >.>
[19-Apr-2014 22:23:38]  <Alicia> Now now Big Teebee.
[19-Apr-2014 22:23:51]  <BGTB2005> or would I have to go with something else?
[19-Apr-2014 22:25:21]  <ponicalica> if it's a 1d8 it'd probably be Tiro Finale big I think
[19-Apr-2014 22:25:34]  <BGTB2005> also I think maybe she'll carry a 1d4 cheap lighter?
[19-Apr-2014 22:26:28]  <ponicalica> cheap lighter makes me think of hitomi again, lol
[19-Apr-2014 22:26:31]  * Alicia just realized brass knuckles plus a staff might be difficult to use, depending on how they're held?
[19-Apr-2014 22:26:41]  * Alicia chalks it up to "Frikkin' magic."
[19-Apr-2014 22:27:30]  <IllFlower> I don't think an Xd8 cannon would be all that justifiable. 2d6 could work, though.
[19-Apr-2014 22:27:46]  <IllFlower> Yeah, yeah, I know, magic, but we have limits.
[19-Apr-2014 22:27:56]  <IllFlower> The lighter's fine. Does Rin smoke?
[19-Apr-2014 22:28:15]  <BGTB2005> I don't believe she would?
[19-Apr-2014 22:28:31]  <Alicia> "I just like how it feels in my pocket, you know?"
[19-Apr-2014 22:28:34]  <IllFlower> Curious as to why she'd carry one around.
[19-Apr-2014 22:28:39]  <IllFlower> Maybe she just really likes fire.
[19-Apr-2014 22:28:42]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: pyromaniac tendencies I think
[19-Apr-2014 22:28:43]  <IllFlower> "Pyromaniac 3d6"
[19-Apr-2014 22:28:58]  <BGTB2005> I was thinking maybe a mundane means of implementing "fuck it, burn everything"
[19-Apr-2014 22:29:15]  <IllFlower> Sounds a bit Complicated History, haha.
[19-Apr-2014 22:29:41]  <IllFlower> "I burned them. I BURNED THEM ALL AND DANCED ON THEIR ASHES BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
[19-Apr-2014 22:30:00]  <IllFlower> "Are - are you okay?"
[19-Apr-2014 22:30:29]  <IllFlower> "*clears throat* But that's all behind me. Yes, it's behind me. Behind me, behind me, behind me..."
[19-Apr-2014 22:33:01]  <IllFlower> Hm, any mementos?
[19-Apr-2014 22:33:26]  <BGTB2005> A necklace, 1d6 probably
[19-Apr-2014 22:33:30]  <BGTB2005> ?
[19-Apr-2014 22:33:45]  <BGTB2005> probably a gift from her friend
[19-Apr-2014 22:34:13]  <Alicia> "Fancy Cannon" Nice.
[19-Apr-2014 22:34:24]  <IllFlower> Something to draw on for strength in times of hardship?
[19-Apr-2014 22:36:37]  <BGTB2005> the necklace?
[19-Apr-2014 22:37:18]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[19-Apr-2014 22:37:32]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[19-Apr-2014 22:37:53]  <BGTB2005> have to go
[19-Apr-2014 22:38:01]  <BGTB2005> going to a movie
[19-Apr-2014 22:38:22]  <BGTB2005> continue after I get back or at next session?
[19-Apr-2014 22:38:55]  <Alicia> I'm fine either way.
[19-Apr-2014 22:39:03]  <ponicalica> i'm okay either way too
[19-Apr-2014 22:40:08]  <IllFlower> Hm, we're basically done with the character sheet, so we can close here for now.
[19-Apr-2014 22:40:14]  <Alicia> Coolio.
[19-Apr-2014 22:40:17]  <IllFlower> Next time we'll do Rin's initiation.
[19-Apr-2014 22:40:21]  <Alicia> =D
[19-Apr-2014 22:40:27]  <Alicia> BGTB2005: What movie. Als, have fun!
[19-Apr-2014 22:40:41]  <Alicia> Also*
[19-Apr-2014 22:43:03]  <IllFlower> Thanks again, everybody.
