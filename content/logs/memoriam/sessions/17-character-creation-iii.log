@time=2014-04-19T21:17:54.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :haven't actually thought the first through
@time=2014-04-19T21:18:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I could see the second feeding into the first.  Fires can be pretty dramatic.

@time=2014-04-19T21:19:28.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm also thinking about the bullying thing related to the second, but that's 1) something that might be a bit too psychopathic for a Conservator 2) more of a relationship
@time=2014-04-19T21:19:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, you also have to assign "Conservator" as either a trait or a relationship.
@time=2014-04-19T21:20:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The former's if Rin uses her status for power in conflict, the latter's if that's what motivates her to enter conflict.

@time=2014-04-19T21:24:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I should mention that mechanics-wise a relationship's dice can't be used unless the relationship is at stake in the conflict somehow.
@time=2014-04-19T21:25:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So in the case of the Conservators, either your character's status as a Conservator is under threat, or the opponent is a Conservator.

@time=2014-04-19T21:47:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right. That's something to keep in mind about her character - how it would motivate her ("I'm past that now" vs. "MEMORY MAKES RIN RAGE DESTROY") is up to you...

@time=2014-04-19T21:57:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: If you were to make it a d4 relationship, she could still think "CRUSH THEM," but in a way that would make her more likely to lose control of herself or the situation.
@time=2014-04-19T22:01:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I do think you should assign at least a couple of the d4s out of the gate, though, not least because they're a big part of what defines the Complicated Community background.
