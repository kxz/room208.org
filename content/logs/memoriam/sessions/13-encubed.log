@time=2014-03-01T21:15:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari, Ayako, and a band of other initiates sit in wooden pews inside a high-ceilinged hall, one that's been used for solemn occasions like this countless times before.
@time=2014-03-01T21:16:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :a wizened, bearded man in flowing robes speaks from an elevated podium at the front of the room.
@time=2014-03-01T21:18:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :he gives his ceremonial eulogy in a language no one present understands, but whose meaning is patently clear to all.
@time=2014-03-01T21:19:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the girls pick out Jun's name here and there. those mentions, as well as a picture frame at the front of the room, are the only indication of who these rites are being performed for.
@time=2014-03-01T21:21:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the elder closes the book he has been reading from, delivers one last Latin proverb in Jun's memory, then exits the room, leaving the Conservators in attendance to a heavy silence.
@time=2014-03-01T21:22:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :gradually, the room begins to empty, as initiate by initiate the audience trickles out without a word.
@time=2014-03-01T21:24:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako, looking up, catches a glance of Hitomi leaving the room. she stands out somewhat, as she's not wearing the ceremonial dress of the Conservators. Hitomi nods in acknowledgment, then makes to leave as well.
@time=2014-03-01T21:26:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :soon, Ayako and Hikari are the only ones left in a chamber that's beginning to darken as the day wanes.

@time=2014-03-01T21:33:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari looks up at the door, catching a glance of Shii standing on the threshold. she's looking elsewhere, though, as if to say, "take your time. don't let me rush you."

@time=2014-03-01T21:43:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii looks down at the ground. she speaks so quietly that it would be hard to hear her voice over a dropped pin.
