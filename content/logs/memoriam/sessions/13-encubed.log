[01-Mar-2014 21:11:16]  <IllFlower> Alicia, ponicalica: okay, shall we start?
[01-Mar-2014 21:11:18]  <ponicalica> sure
[01-Mar-2014 21:11:58]  <Alicia> Sure.
[01-Mar-2014 21:12:36]  *** Alicia is now known as Hiiragi
[01-Mar-2014 21:14:08]  <IllFlower> it might just be a projection of the gloomy mood, but the sky looks darker than usual this morning.
[01-Mar-2014 21:15:48]  <IllFlower> Hikari, Ayako, and a band of other initiates sit in wooden pews inside a high-ceilinged hall, one that's been used for solemn occasions like this countless times before.
[01-Mar-2014 21:16:37]  <IllFlower> a wizened, bearded man in flowing robes speaks from an elevated podium at the front of the room.
[01-Mar-2014 21:18:10]  <IllFlower> he gives his ceremonial eulogy in a language no one present understands, but whose meaning is patently clear to all.
[01-Mar-2014 21:19:35]  <IllFlower> the girls pick out Jun's name here and there. those mentions, as well as a picture frame at the front of the room, are the only indication of who these rites are being performed for.
[01-Mar-2014 21:21:51]  <IllFlower> the elder closes the book he has been reading from, delivers one last Latin proverb in Jun's memory, then exits the room, leaving the Conservators in attendance to a heavy silence.
[01-Mar-2014 21:22:48]  <IllFlower> gradually, the room begins to empty, as initiate by initiate the audience trickles out without a word.
[01-Mar-2014 21:24:53]  <IllFlower> Ayako, looking up, catches a glance of Hitomi leaving the room. she stands out somewhat, as she's not wearing the ceremonial dress of the Conservators. Hitomi nods in acknowledgment, then makes to leave as well.
[01-Mar-2014 21:26:02]  <IllFlower> soon, Ayako and Hikari are the only ones left in a chamber that's beginning to darken as the day wanes.
[01-Mar-2014 21:26:24]  <IllFlower> someone should probably say something.
[01-Mar-2014 21:26:25]  <ponicalica> "...it should have been me.  Not her.  I was just standing out there when she died."
[01-Mar-2014 21:29:46]  <Hiiragi> Hikari, still thinking on what's happened, responds sluggishly. Her mouth opens uselessly, before she cracks out "It's... not your fault. Ayako. Those girls, there was - we couldn't..." her voice cracks uncharacteristically.
[01-Mar-2014 21:31:03]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Verzweiflung GmbH
[01-Mar-2014 21:31:12]  <ponicalica> does that mean "despair"
[01-Mar-2014 21:31:24]  <IllFlower> mmmmaybe.
[01-Mar-2014 21:31:24]  <Hiiragi> She looks listlessly at Jun's portrait, then back to Ayako. "I think that we should go. Unless you want to stay..?"
[01-Mar-2014 21:33:49]  <IllFlower> Hikari looks up at the door, catching a glance of Shii standing on the threshold. she's looking elsewhere, though, as if to say, "take your time. don't let me rush you."
[01-Mar-2014 21:34:28]  <ponicalica> Ayako looks at Jun's portrait again and tries and fails to hold in tears.
[01-Mar-2014 21:36:52]  <ponicalica> Through tears, "We...should probably go."
[01-Mar-2014 21:39:47]  <Hiiragi> Hikari nods, carefully looking the other way she she holds back her own tears, helping Ayako up. "Mm.. then let's."
[01-Mar-2014 21:40:24]  <Hiiragi> Her steps are measured, biding time until they have to talk with Shii.
[01-Mar-2014 21:42:04]  <IllFlower> no matter how much she tries to stall, though, she eventually finds herself in the same doorway.
[01-Mar-2014 21:43:15]  <IllFlower> Shii looks down at the ground. she speaks so quietly that it would be hard to hear her voice over a dropped pin.
[01-Mar-2014 21:44:41]  <IllFlower> "I'm sorry," she says, simply. this might be the fifth or sixth time she's said this to the girls.
[01-Mar-2014 21:46:41]  <ponicalica> "I was just standing outside when it happened.  How am I supposed to live with myself now, knowing that I let Jun die?"
[01-Mar-2014 21:48:41]  <IllFlower> "you don't," Shii says.
[01-Mar-2014 21:48:42]  <IllFlower> "eventually, you realize that her death wasn't your fault. that's how you keep on living.
[01-Mar-2014 21:49:05]  <IllFlower> "it's getting there that's the difficult part."
[01-Mar-2014 21:50:46]  <Hiiragi> "Thanks." Hikari nods in acknowledgement. "Ayako, if you let her die then so did I... but, we -" hervoice cuts off, before resuming "she chose to do that. It's the best she could do, for you... and me."
[01-Mar-2014 21:51:25]  <Hiiragi> (her voice*)
[01-Mar-2014 21:53:58]  <ponicalica> "I...I suppose.  But when my job as a Conservator starts like this, it makes it hard for me to convince myself that I'm fit for the position..."
[01-Mar-2014 21:54:55]  <IllFlower> "it was just bad luck.
[01-Mar-2014 21:56:13]  <IllFlower> "maybe this won't mean anything to you, but I've watched over a number of Conservators who started out just like you have. I've watched them overcome it.
[01-Mar-2014 21:57:13]  <IllFlower> "I have confidence that you can too."
[01-Mar-2014 21:58:37]  <ponicalica> "...mmm.  We lost Kotomi, and now we lost our lead with Minami, though."
[01-Mar-2014 22:00:00]  <IllFlower> "with any luck, it won't matter. perhaps Jun's sacrifice can put an end to all this."
[01-Mar-2014 22:01:42]  <Hiiragi> "I... din't, didn't, know her very well, but Jun never seemed the type to sacrifice herself for nothing."
[01-Mar-2014 22:01:50]  <Hiiragi> (don't*)
[01-Mar-2014 22:03:35]  <ponicalica> (you sure about that, Hiiragi :p)
[01-Mar-2014 22:04:20]  <Hiiragi> (As sure as she can be.)
[01-Mar-2014 22:05:09]  <Hiiragi> (Properly comforting people is hard!!1)
[01-Mar-2014 22:05:43]  <IllFlower> "Hikari's right," Shii says.
[01-Mar-2014 22:06:15]  <IllFlower> "even if we can't be sure, we have to believe that Jun didn't die in vain.
[01-Mar-2014 22:06:33]  <IllFlower> "otherwise we'll have given up before we even started."
[01-Mar-2014 22:10:10]  <ponicalica> "What do we do though?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:12:53]  <IllFlower> "there may be nothing left for us to do. if that's the case, then we can be grateful.
[01-Mar-2014 22:13:15]  <IllFlower> "if not, then... that's a question we'll answer when the time comes."
[01-Mar-2014 22:15:40]  <ponicalica> "The time comes?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:16:40]  <IllFlower> Shii nods. "if trouble rises again."
[01-Mar-2014 22:17:19]  <IllFlower> I can cue scene change whenever.
[01-Mar-2014 22:18:18]  <ponicalica> I'm okay with it.  Hiiragi?
[01-Mar-2014 22:19:15]  <Hiiragi> Likewise.
[01-Mar-2014 22:20:08]  <IllFlower> a long, downbeat lull hangs over the group for the next week.
[01-Mar-2014 22:20:59]  <IllFlower> no new assignments come in for a while, nor news of Minami and Shouko's cult.
[01-Mar-2014 22:23:27]  <IllFlower> finally, while Ayako and Hikari are spending a taciturn afternoon in the library, Shii appears with the usual *crack*, a more-or-less normal look on her face.
[01-Mar-2014 22:23:48]  <ponicalica> does Shii even have looks on her face?  I was kind of assuming a Kyubeyesque unchanging expression, lol
[01-Mar-2014 22:24:01]  <IllFlower> "Ayako, Hikari, there's something I need the two of you to investigate."
[01-Mar-2014 22:25:05]  <ponicalica> "...Hm?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:25:36]  <Hiiragi> "What is it, Shii?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:25:47]  <IllFlower> she conjures up a map of a nearby neighborhood. a burning blue line pens off a small square.
[01-Mar-2014 22:27:28]  <IllFlower> "an initiate reported this to us. someone's set up a magical cordon in this area.
[01-Mar-2014 22:28:13]  <ponicalica> "Like the one I set up in the railyard?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:29:03]  <IllFlower> "yes, something similar to that.
[01-Mar-2014 22:29:22]  <IllFlower> the circumstances are suspicious, to say the least. it's been up for four or five days at this point, and nobody in the Order has been informed as to why."
[01-Mar-2014 22:31:53]  <Hiiragi> "The circumstances? Do you think someone else is trying to cause havoc among Conservators?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:33:54]  <IllFlower> "it's a bit like if a tall fence were to suddenly appear in your neighborhood, blocking it off from the outside world. that's what I mean."
[01-Mar-2014 22:34:45]  <ponicalica> "Is there anything special known to be inside the cordon?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:36:57]  <Hiiragi> "I see. Anyone, or anything, notable inside it, too?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:38:43]  <IllFlower> "nobody's been inside yet. it'd be foolish to poke the hornet's nest like that.
[01-Mar-2014 22:39:06]  <IllFlower> "the area it's been set up in seems specifically chosen to be out of the way, though.
[01-Mar-2014 22:39:54]  <IllFlower> "it's a largely empty complex of residential buildings that haven't been occupied yet.
[01-Mar-2014 22:40:07]  <IllFlower> "whoever it is more than likely doesn't want to be discovered."
[01-Mar-2014 22:40:18]  *** AttObl is now known as AttObl|TheDarkMod
[01-Mar-2014 22:40:24]  <ponicalica> "Are you suggesting we go in?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:41:38]  <IllFlower> "it's your decision. you might be able to get a sense of what's happening from the outside, though."
[01-Mar-2014 22:44:43]  <ponicalica> "Hmmm.  Hikari, what do you think?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:47:33]  <ponicalica> "I think it would at least be worthwhile to investigate, maybe figure out who put it up.  It's definitely suspicious."
[01-Mar-2014 22:47:34]  <Hiiragi> Hikari looks at her book, setting it down. "I think we should go, at least to check up on it. We can leave early if need be. Does that sound okay, Ayako?"
[01-Mar-2014 22:48:49]  <Hiiragi> "I'm agreed, something does seem rather off. We can just play it by ear, perhaps."
[01-Mar-2014 22:49:37]  <IllFlower> just a second.
[01-Mar-2014 22:54:38]  <IllFlower> give me five, I'll be back at the top of the hour.
[01-Mar-2014 22:54:55]  <ponicalica> tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
[01-Mar-2014 22:55:53]  * Hiiragi imagines the clocks from 999.
[01-Mar-2014 22:55:59]  * Hiiragi D:

[01-Mar-2014 22:59:01]  <Hiiragi> Heheheh.
[01-Mar-2014 22:59:24]  <ponicalica> twenty-four clocks
[01-Mar-2014 22:59:29]  <ponicalica> (one for every hour)
[01-Mar-2014 23:00:03]  <IllFlower> and here I am. sorry about that.
[01-Mar-2014 23:00:18]  <IllFlower> will the girls be off, then?
[01-Mar-2014 23:00:43]  <ponicalica> I assume so, yeah.
[01-Mar-2014 23:01:04]  <Hiiragi> Yeah, thinking so.
[01-Mar-2014 23:01:19]  <IllFlower> then off we go.
[01-Mar-2014 23:02:38]  <IllFlower> the skies are clear today, for what feels like the first time in a while.
[01-Mar-2014 23:04:16]  <IllFlower> Ayako and Hikari head north on a commuter train, watching the modern high-rises of the city slowly give way to older wooden houses.
[01-Mar-2014 23:05:26]  <IllFlower> hopping off at their destination, they spot a tremendous purple cube, one that would be nearly impossible to miss for any initiate.
[01-Mar-2014 23:05:49]  <IllFlower> it's perhaps a hundred meters on a side, looking like some kind of boxy spaceship.
[01-Mar-2014 23:06:23]  <Nitya> 1,1"one that would be nearly impossible to miss for anybody looking"
[01-Mar-2014 23:06:48]  <ponicalica> it has a SEP field, jeez Nitya
[01-Mar-2014 23:07:05]  <ponicalica> ("Purple.  That was Jun's color."  Ayako and Hikari break into tears.)
[01-Mar-2014 23:07:32]  <IllFlower> "was blind, but now I seeeeeeee"
[01-Mar-2014 23:08:46]  <ponicalica> At any rate I guess the girls should head towards the cube.
[01-Mar-2014 23:09:00]  <Hiiragi> Mhm.
[01-Mar-2014 23:09:02]  <IllFlower> it's possible to make out the vague shapes of buildings inside the somewhat transparent surfaces, but not much more than that. the image is blurred, as if out of focus.
[01-Mar-2014 23:15:21]  <IllFlower> the two girls walk up to the sidewalk opposite the cube. Hikari picks up a rock and throws it at the barrier. there's something of a... sucking sound, as the rock seems to dissolve into it.
[01-Mar-2014 23:15:28]  <IllFlower> okay, what do, folks
[01-Mar-2014 23:16:33]  <Hiiragi> "So, do you think we should - no. Ayako, is there anything you can discern from the outside?" Hikari questions, obviously not as well-versed as Ayako.

[01-Mar-2014 23:17:53]  <ponicalica> "It's a rather strong barrier, that's for sure.  And it was very deliberately chosen, which I could see on the map since they used a rectangular slice instead of a circle, but here I can see it even clearer, as it cleaves to the road."
[01-Mar-2014 23:18:24]  <ponicalica> (editor to translator: "cleaves to the road?  wtf is that")
[01-Mar-2014 23:20:01]  <IllFlower> or maybe it's just https://room208.org/booru/posts/244 - who knows
[01-Mar-2014 23:20:02]  <Omnipresence> 14URL: [room208.org] original drawn by iwai ryo - Omnibooru ter
[01-Mar-2014 23:22:10]  <IllFlower> so, the way I see it, you've got a few options
[01-Mar-2014 23:22:17]  <IllFlower> 1) take down the barrier directly
[01-Mar-2014 23:22:20]  <Hiiragi> "Then they aren't messing around, as expected." Hikari looks around inquisitively. "I don't take that it's very safe in there."
[01-Mar-2014 23:22:27]  <IllFlower> 2) try to cause enough of a scene to draw out whoever's inside
[01-Mar-2014 23:22:38]  <IllFlower> 3) micdrop and walk out
[01-Mar-2014 23:23:23]  <ponicalica> Of course, if we do 1) or 2), will whoever's inside be able to overwhelm us, is the question.
[01-Mar-2014 23:23:34]  <Hiiragi> Pretty much.
[01-Mar-2014 23:24:21]  <Hiiragi> Don't want to get trapped in whatever this is, either.
[01-Mar-2014 23:24:32]  <Hiiragi> Hikari certainly isn't a magical magical girl. :v
[01-Mar-2014 23:24:42]  <IllFlower> 1) is probably the most dangerous option. 2) is a bit safer, at least it doesn't seem as aggressive.

[01-Mar-2014 23:27:34]  <ponicalica> although with 2) there's also the question of how to do so.  I do think that with only two Conservators and who the hell knows what inside there they should probably not want to attack directly, maybe even run away once they figure out what's going on.
[01-Mar-2014 23:27:35]  <Hiiragi> "I don't think it'd be too wise if charged in. I'm not sure if I want to, honestly. What about you Ayako?"
[01-Mar-2014 23:28:23]  <Hiiragi> Yeah, the how is also something. We don't have have to *kill* anyone or anything, just learn something.
[01-Mar-2014 23:29:32]  <IllFlower> you can always try setting off a harmless magical flare or something.
[01-Mar-2014 23:31:02]  <ponicalica> cause a magical ruckus outside, basically?
[01-Mar-2014 23:31:48]  <IllFlower> yeah, that was the idea for 2)
[01-Mar-2014 23:32:11]  <Hiiragi> I'm for it.
[01-Mar-2014 23:32:38]  <ponicalica> will this be a conflict, with the stakes something like drawing someone out?
[01-Mar-2014 23:33:12]  <IllFlower> depends on what you do.
[01-Mar-2014 23:36:13]  <ponicalica> Ayako points her wand into the air, and produces a beam of light pulsing into the air, visible even in the daylight.
[01-Mar-2014 23:36:40]  <IllFlower> might need a little more than that.
[01-Mar-2014 23:36:46]  <IllFlower> I like explosions, but that's just me.
[01-Mar-2014 23:37:08]  <ponicalica> hmmm
[01-Mar-2014 23:37:30]  <Hiiragi> Poke it with your magic wand.
[01-Mar-2014 23:41:36]  <ponicalica> "Can you help me with this one, Hikari?"  Ayako sets up a circle just outside the barrier, and covers her ears as she walks away before a *crack* of lightning lands in the middle of the circle.
[01-Mar-2014 23:42:58]  <Hiiragi> "Well, er, what do you want me do?"
[01-Mar-2014 23:43:30]  <IllFlower> BURN WITH THE FIRE OF A THOUSAND SUNS
[01-Mar-2014 23:43:42]  <ponicalica> what just happened I guess.  yeah I dunno wrt the first sentence :V
[01-Mar-2014 23:47:41]  <ponicalica> maybe hikari should do something if that doesn't do the trick
[01-Mar-2014 23:47:53]  <IllFlower> the crooked path of the lightning touches the wall in a couple of places, leaving small holes in its wake and sending an electric crackle across the entire surface of the barrier.

[01-Mar-2014 23:49:43]  <ponicalica> well let's see I think IllFlower might be going for something
[01-Mar-2014 23:49:50]  <Hiiragi> Ah, right.
[01-Mar-2014 23:50:02]  <Nitya> 14oh no, IllFlower isn't doing t he ** thing we forgot about half the time
[01-Mar-2014 23:53:12]  <IllFlower> it looks like the barrier is trying to heal itself, but the electricity is throwing the whole process off. the rims of the circular holes bubble like boiling water.
[01-Mar-2014 23:55:17]  <IllFlower> soon enough, a girl flies down from the top of the nearest building inside the barrier. it takes very little time for her expression to change from one of aggravation to one of surprised recognition when she sees Ayako.
[01-Mar-2014 23:55:39]  <ponicalica> ("it was...hitomi!")
[01-Mar-2014 23:55:54]  <IllFlower> "you're..."
[01-Mar-2014 23:56:51]  <IllFlower> the short girl with long hair isn't wearing her track jacket, but Ayako doesn't need it to remember that her name is Mai Shirakawa.
[01-Mar-2014 23:57:51]  <IllFlower> her posture stiffens as she draws herself upright, unsure whether to put on a pose of deference or aggression.
[02-Mar-2014 00:00:27]  <ponicalica> (oshit)
[02-Mar-2014 00:00:48]  <IllFlower> your turn to speak first.
[02-Mar-2014 00:02:29]  <ponicalica> hmm.  what should Ayako say.
[02-Mar-2014 00:03:51]  <IllFlower> "hey, girl! long time no see"

[02-Mar-2014 00:05:36]  <IllFlower> I'm going to guess Hikari's pretty nonplussed about all this?
[02-Mar-2014 00:06:12]  <Hiiragi> I got called away, sorry.
[02-Mar-2014 00:06:56]  <IllFlower> "what do you usually use barriers for?" Mai responds, adopting a tone resembling that of a teacher working her students through a multi-step math problem.
[02-Mar-2014 00:08:15]  <Hiiragi> "Hello, Shirakawa." Hikari begins, offering her hand before getting second thoughts.
[02-Mar-2014 00:08:29]  <Hiiragi> "Anyway, that would be deal with witches, I think?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:08:50]  <ponicalica> "To hide things, of course.  Given your record, I assume it's something against the rules."

[02-Mar-2014 00:12:45]  <ponicalica> "From?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:13:06]  <IllFlower> "what do you mean, 'from'?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:13:20]  <IllFlower> Mai's expression turns bewildered.
[02-Mar-2014 00:13:52]  <ponicalica> "What are you protecting yourself against?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:14:02]  <Nitya> 14lol
[02-Mar-2014 00:14:05]  <IllFlower> "you're Conservators. four people died last week. do you really need to ask?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:14:22]  <IllFlower> mm, swap the first two sentences.
[02-Mar-2014 00:15:14]  <IllFlower> basically I meant to say that she's saying "dude, how do you not know?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:17:59]  <Hiiragi> Hikari looks around some more, getting over being ignored. "And the Order is fine with this? Or that it's even..." She leaves the second question hanging, not sure how to proceed with this new unknown girl.

[02-Mar-2014 00:19:43]  <IllFlower> "fine with... protecting myself?" Mai's voice rises in indignation. "what exactly do you *want*?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:20:38]  <ponicalica> "Fine with taking five city blocks for yourself.  Imagine if every magical girl did that." this almost feels like social conflict level
[02-Mar-2014 00:21:55]  <Hiiragi> Hikari's taken aback, her brows furrowing. "Listen, we just got word that there was some unusual activity in this area. We don't mean harm, but this *is* something worth at least questioning."
[02-Mar-2014 00:24:09]  <IllFlower> "five city blocks is a small price to pay if it means I don't get dragged into a full-scale war. especially out here in the middle of nowhere.
[02-Mar-2014 00:24:45]  <IllFlower> "tell me, if it was between fortifying a few tower blocks and possibly losing your life, which would you pick?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:26:05]  <ponicalica> "I don't know about myself, but there was a girl who would fight to protect us all even at the risk of her own life..." Ayako starts to tear up, thinking of Jun.
[02-Mar-2014 00:28:51]  <IllFlower> Mai stands, silent.
[02-Mar-2014 00:29:02]  <Hiiragi> Hikari pats Ayako gently, trying not to be too obtrusive. "We get that, we haven't been sitting pretty as is." She grits her teeth. "But, I'm curious, was no one else really willing to help? Or are ther unusual circumstances here?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:30:11]  <Hiiragi> (Try to be nice; whoops?)
[02-Mar-2014 00:32:01]  <IllFlower> "how can you keep talking like you don't know anything?" Mai's voice is low, but furious. "'unusual circumstances'? have you not seen the torches on the walls? have you not heard about Satsuki Osada? have you not seen the bodies?!" she asks, nearly rising into hysterics.
[02-Mar-2014 00:33:24]  <Hiiragi> (No we haven't heard of Osada?)
[02-Mar-2014 00:33:46]  <IllFlower> (might be something to ask about)
[02-Mar-2014 00:34:38]  <IllFlower> guess Mai isn't such a timid girl after all.
[02-Mar-2014 00:35:02]  <ponicalica> "I haven't heard of Osada.  Is she the one that sent...that sent the girls that killed Jun?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:35:17]  <ponicalica> (session 13: ayako-cries-a-lot.txt)
[02-Mar-2014 00:35:58]  <Hiiragi> "Osada is news to us, and only Osada." Hikari responds as politely as she can, raising her hand.

[02-Mar-2014 00:36:57]  <IllFlower> Mai's expression changes when Ayako mentions Jun's name.
[02-Mar-2014 00:37:14]  <IllFlower> "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I didn't know..."
[02-Mar-2014 00:37:49]  <IllFlower> Mai sizes up Hikari. "come to think of it, you were with a different group last time.
[02-Mar-2014 00:38:00]  <IllFlower> "was she one of them? Jun Takanashi?"
[02-Mar-2014 00:38:34]  <ponicalica> Ayako's lost her composure.  She simply nods.
[02-Mar-2014 00:38:48]  <Hiiragi> (Sorry to be a dummy, but is "different group" reference something I'm forgetting.)
[02-Mar-2014 00:38:56]  <Hiiragi> (Or know but am not recognizing.)
[02-Mar-2014 00:39:00]  <ponicalica> (it's that it was Ayako, Hitomi, Jun)
[02-Mar-2014 00:39:19]  <Hiiragi> (Okay, I'm just over-thinking. ^^;)
[02-Mar-2014 00:40:24]  <IllFlower> "come inside," Mai says. "there are a lot of things you need to know."
[02-Mar-2014 00:40:45]  <IllFlower> she opens a hole in the barrier, the shape of an arched doorway.
[02-Mar-2014 00:41:06]  <Hiiragi> "I- we, appreciate the offer." she responds lightly, keeping an eye on Ayako as they walk in.
[02-Mar-2014 00:41:53]  <IllFlower> okay, I'm going to call it here, if you guys don't mind.
[02-Mar-2014 00:42:00]  <IllFlower> I think this is a good place to pick up for next time.
[02-Mar-2014 00:42:52]  <ponicalica> okay
[02-Mar-2014 00:43:03]  <ponicalica> cliffhanger there, lol
[02-Mar-2014 00:43:11]  <Hiiragi> I don't mind.
[02-Mar-2014 00:43:34]  <IllFlower> cool. thanks for playing, guys.
[02-Mar-2014 00:43:42]  <Hiiragi> Session 13: Hikari continues being the odd one out.
[02-Mar-2014 00:43:44]  <ponicalica> "next session, of course, is going to be Rig's character creation."
[02-Mar-2014 00:43:46]  <IllFlower> in the next episode: REVELATIONS! also other books of the Bible!
[02-Mar-2014 00:43:59]  <IllFlower> see you then.
