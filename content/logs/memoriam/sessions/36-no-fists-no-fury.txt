[26-Oct-2014 19:08:45]  <BGTB2005> hahahaha
[26-Oct-2014 19:08:45]  <Alicia> Hahah.
[26-Oct-2014 19:08:59]  <Rig> MD:CIGAM
[26-Oct-2014 19:09:04]  <Alicia> Now now, Hikari and Ayako are fine.
[26-Oct-2014 19:09:27]  <IllFlower> Last we saw our heroes, they had just talked to Asacchi about her problems with that Karasuma guy.
[26-Oct-2014 19:10:21]  <IllFlower> Oh, and I guess there was that thing about that girl that Hikari knows who knew Jun.
[26-Oct-2014 19:11:08]  <Rig> And I believe the group had decided on staking out the school where Karasuma goes?
[26-Oct-2014 19:11:29]  <ponicalica> I think so
[26-Oct-2014 19:11:32]  <Alicia> Yes.
[26-Oct-2014 19:11:37]  <IllFlower> Indeed. Is that still the direction we're going in?
[26-Oct-2014 19:11:48]  <Rig> I can work with that.
[26-Oct-2014 19:11:53]  <Alicia> Same.
[26-Oct-2014 19:11:55]  <IllFlower> Or are we going to stride in and pin him to a wall in the hallway?
[26-Oct-2014 19:12:10]  <Rig> No. The walls will be on fire first.
[26-Oct-2014 19:12:24]  <Alicia> o_O
[26-Oct-2014 19:12:37]  <IllFlower> Sure, okay.
[26-Oct-2014 19:14:18]  <Alicia> So violent up in here.
[26-Oct-2014 19:14:33]  <IllFlower> Karasuma's school is kind of awkwardly wedged into an oblong plot of land between packed-together houses.
[26-Oct-2014 19:14:36]  <Rig> Just trying to get in the mood.
[26-Oct-2014 19:15:50]  <IllFlower> It's still the middle of the day, and while many of the students have cleared out, there are still clubs here and there staging practice or having meetings.
[26-Oct-2014 19:16:29]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[26-Oct-2014 19:16:31]  <IllFlower> The soccer club looks especially the worse for wear in the muddy terrain.
[26-Oct-2014 19:17:36]  <IllFlower> A little birdie has indicated that Karasuma likes to loiter around on the roof after classes adjourn. Maybe he's somewhere up there, who knows.
[26-Oct-2014 19:18:39]  <Rig> Where would we be staked out?
[26-Oct-2014 19:19:00]  <ponicalica> I wouldn't be surprised if Rin would be taking a birds-eye view, tbh
[26-Oct-2014 19:19:09]  <Alicia> Heh.
[26-Oct-2014 19:20:32]  <BGTB2005> I'm not yet seeing how that would be a bad idea
[26-Oct-2014 19:20:58]  <IllFlower> Nobody ever said it was.
[26-Oct-2014 19:21:24]  <BGTB2005> other than maybe reports of an unusually large bird on the evening news
[26-Oct-2014 19:21:33]  <Rig> The rest of the group is probably hanging out of another nearby rooftop maybe?
[26-Oct-2014 19:21:45]  <Alicia> Prooobably.
[26-Oct-2014 19:22:16]  <IllFlower> There's just the one building, and it's the tallest thing for a ways around.
[26-Oct-2014 19:23:05]  <Rig> Okay, so how are we staking this out?
[26-Oct-2014 19:23:16]  <Alicia> Maybe Ayako and Hikari are watching around the area below him inside?
[26-Oct-2014 19:23:24]  <Alicia> Acting like students, or some crap.
[26-Oct-2014 19:23:33]  <Rig> Kazuki doesn't really look like a student.
[26-Oct-2014 19:23:44]  <ponicalica> Kazuki's clearly a, uh, teacher
[26-Oct-2014 19:23:59]  <Alicia> TA/.
[26-Oct-2014 19:24:00]  <Alicia> .*
[26-Oct-2014 19:24:45]  <Rig> That would probably work.
[26-Oct-2014 19:24:55]  <Rig> So, are we just wandering the halls suspiciously.
[26-Oct-2014 19:26:17]  <IllFlower> Don't look at me!
[26-Oct-2014 19:26:18]  <BGTB2005> most of the alternatives I can think of will let him know we're after him
[26-Oct-2014 19:26:57]  <Rig> Okay, I have a thing, not very useful but it's a thing.
[26-Oct-2014 19:27:04]  <Alicia> `-`?

[26-Oct-2014 19:27:06]  <BGTB2005> ...we do have a picture of Karasuma, yes?
[26-Oct-2014 19:27:19]  <Alicia> Ayako recognizes him.
[26-Oct-2014 19:27:26]  <Alicia> Hikari knows a jerk when she sees them.
[26-Oct-2014 19:27:41]  *** Section42L <~section@CPE18593345ef4c-CM18593345ef49.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[26-Oct-2014 19:28:03]  <Rig> Kazuki and Hikari are camped across the street from the main school entrance, waiting for Rin and Ayako to spot the target. Kazuki takes the opportunity to pose some questions to Hikari.
[26-Oct-2014 19:28:36]  <Alicia> I'm for that but I need water real quick, sorry
[26-Oct-2014 19:28:39]  <Rig> "Hikari, could I ask you something?"
[26-Oct-2014 19:31:06]  <Alicia> Hikari takes a break from her intense surveillance to change focus. "Yes, you may. What is it, Kazuki?"
[26-Oct-2014 19:31:51]  <Rig> "The situation between you and Miho was... tense, to be honest. Is there something we should know about her?"
[26-Oct-2014 19:35:42]  <Alicia> Figuring that Miho was going to be the subject, Hikari idly touches the binoculars while thinking of an answer. "We... have something of a history, her being Junpei's sister, and all."
[26-Oct-2014 19:36:41]  <Alicia> "My best friend. Known each other for years, though he's off somewhere else now," she quickly clarifies. "Miho... was also a Conservator, though I'm sure you figured as much out by now."
[26-Oct-2014 19:37:10]  <Rig> "Was?" Kazuki asks. "She was demoted? That's pretty uncommon."
[26-Oct-2014 19:40:17]  <Alicia> "Well... yes. A setup, though - not something she would have had anything to do with. I know, and she is not like that."
[26-Oct-2014 19:40:40]  <ponicalica> ("Also her partner was your old character.")
[26-Oct-2014 19:41:13]  <Alicia> "And she has a history with..." she begins, trailing off, looking back off at the school.
[26-Oct-2014 19:42:19]  <Rig> Kazuki nods and looks up to see if he can spot Rin. He wonders if he should talk to Miho himself. Maybe Hikari's friendship kept the truth hidden a bit.
[26-Oct-2014 19:43:11]  <Alicia> Hikari sighs. "I'm sorry, Kazuki, but I feel inclined to ask. Why are you asking? This is... unusual, even if expected." She asks, before returning to a half-hearted surveillance.
[26-Oct-2014 19:43:32]  <Alicia> (Brb, sec.)
[26-Oct-2014 19:44:00]  <ponicalica> Ayako continues to walk around the school looking for Karasuma, still as awkward as the previous time doing such a thing
[26-Oct-2014 19:45:04]  <Rig> "If you haven't noticed, we're kind of a disjointed team. I was thinking that if we tried talking about things that clearly bother us maybe we could..." Kazuki pauses, looking for the right word. "I guess just be more effective."
[26-Oct-2014 19:46:06]  <IllFlower> Kazuki's suddenly being sensitive? The fangirls swoon.
[26-Oct-2014 19:48:47]  <Alicia> Hikari snickers, her frown  disappearing briefly. "No, we... really are. I haven't been oblivious to the fact." She goes silent for a bit, contemplating an answer. "Then might I please ask, what do you have in mind for Karasuma?"
[26-Oct-2014 19:48:53]  <Alicia> "What you want to do here."
[26-Oct-2014 19:49:22]  <Rig> Quick reminder for myself: Karasuma has been bullying people to do what exactly? What were his crimes again?
[26-Oct-2014 19:49:58]  <Rig> Right, violent attacks on other initiates.
[26-Oct-2014 19:50:30]  <Alicia> And also bullying/assaulting random people. At least one, that is.
[26-Oct-2014 19:50:50]  <Alicia> Plus the whole "getting a following thing"
[26-Oct-2014 19:51:13]  <Rig> "Personally, I'd like to stop Karasuma without bloodshed." Kazuki says. "He may be a thug misusing his powers, but he doesn't deserve to be beat to a pulp."
[26-Oct-2014 19:51:25]  <IllFlower> ("Not yet.")
[26-Oct-2014 19:51:49]  <IllFlower> ("And I think we're close to overdrawing our accounts at the violence bank.")
[26-Oct-2014 19:51:53]  <Rig> "I'd just like the Order to actually function like an order and not like a bunch of rambunctious teenagers."
[26-Oct-2014 19:52:13]  <BGTB2005> (Rin: "But that's the perfect reason to do so!")
[26-Oct-2014 19:52:27]  <IllFlower> He is aware that the Order is mostly composed of rambunctious teenagers, right? :p
[26-Oct-2014 19:52:34]  <Rig> Yes.
[26-Oct-2014 19:52:42]  <Rig> :P
[26-Oct-2014 19:52:56]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: He's a rambunctious twenty-something, though, which makes him superior to all the rambunctious teens
[26-Oct-2014 19:54:39]  <Alicia> "Yes..." Hikari responds rather despondently, the comments hitting close to home. "He just needs to be taken to the Order. We will handle this, and the Order will handle the rest..."
[26-Oct-2014 19:56:02]  <ponicalica> the problem's that we don't actually know how he's doing stuff, right?
[26-Oct-2014 19:57:05]  <Rig> All our evidence is heresay, but has that ever stopped us?
[26-Oct-2014 19:57:35]  <Alicia> Well, we did see him assaulting some random man, although he wasn't magical.
[26-Oct-2014 19:57:46]  <ponicalica> nah, I think that was someone else doing the assaulting there?
[26-Oct-2014 19:57:48]  <IllFlower> That wasn't him.
[26-Oct-2014 19:57:52]  <Alicia> Also, pretty sure Kazuki could get him to spill the beans anyway? :p
[26-Oct-2014 19:57:53]  <Alicia> Derp
[26-Oct-2014 19:57:56]  <Alicia> Sorry, I'm off
[26-Oct-2014 19:58:03]  <ponicalica> ?
[26-Oct-2014 19:58:12]  <Alicia> Misremembered
[26-Oct-2014 19:58:17]  <ponicalica> oh, you just mean "off" as in you forgot stuff, not having to leave
[26-Oct-2014 19:58:18]  <ponicalica> :V
[26-Oct-2014 19:58:23]  <Alicia> Yes
[26-Oct-2014 19:58:26]  <Alicia> >_<
[26-Oct-2014 19:58:42]  <Rig> "Where is he anyway? Has anyone seen him?" Kazuki mutters to himself.
[26-Oct-2014 19:58:46]  <ponicalica> Ayako sees another student nearby, and asks if Karasuma is anywhere nearby.
[26-Oct-2014 19:59:14]  <IllFlower> Meanwhile, Rin spots a group of three boys standing on the rooftop, and conveys this to Ayako on the ground with a series of odd hand gestures.
[26-Oct-2014 19:59:46]  <Rig> Rin flips off Ayako, in other words.
[26-Oct-2014 19:59:46]  <IllFlower> She subsequently gives up on those and just comes back to ground level to say it to Ayako directly.
[26-Oct-2014 20:00:34]  <ponicalica> Rig: Giving her the bird.
[26-Oct-2014 20:00:50]  <Alicia> (Hey.)
[26-Oct-2014 20:05:52]  <ponicalica> So should Ayako/Rin now call Hikari/Kazuki to the roof as well?
[26-Oct-2014 20:06:18]  <IllFlower> I'm just waiting for you guys to do stuff.
[26-Oct-2014 20:07:09]  <Rig> "Let's go find them," Kazuki says to Hikari. "If anyone asks I'm your older brother or something."
[26-Oct-2014 20:07:12]  <IllFlower> Don't ask questions! Just do things! Until I smack you down for doing the wrong ones.
[26-Oct-2014 20:07:38]  <Buttercupistiny> excellent leadership, nemo
[26-Oct-2014 20:07:41]  <Alicia> Hikari nods and follows off.
[26-Oct-2014 20:07:49]  <ponicalica> Ayako hears Rin's comments and goes to find Hikari, etc, head towards the roof
[26-Oct-2014 20:08:27]  <IllFlower> Read: "Hikari follows and nods off."
[26-Oct-2014 20:08:48]  <IllFlower> Buttercupistiny: Actual GMing principle for this game! Just rephrased somewhat.
[26-Oct-2014 20:08:51]  <Alicia> Sorry?
[26-Oct-2014 20:08:53]  <Alicia> Oh.
[26-Oct-2014 20:08:53]  <BGTB2005> (yeah, I read it that way too)
[26-Oct-2014 20:08:55]  <Alicia> Misread.

[26-Oct-2014 20:13:08]  <Rig> "Is there anyway we can listen in?" (Maybe a conflict?)
[26-Oct-2014 20:13:35]  <IllFlower> You want to do this without being detected?
[26-Oct-2014 20:13:47]  <Rig> Preferably.
[26-Oct-2014 20:13:48]  <IllFlower> No breaking down the door and swarming in, guns blazing?
[26-Oct-2014 20:14:08]  <Rig> We're all way out of character today
[26-Oct-2014 20:14:13]  <BGTB2005> right now we just want to trail him for a bit
[26-Oct-2014 20:14:27]  <Alicia> Hikari isn't in the mood for staves blazing and whatnot.
[26-Oct-2014 20:14:46]  <ponicalica> I think Ayako's now trying to hold herself back, we'll see if she succeeds
[26-Oct-2014 20:14:52]  <IllFlower> So how are we going to go about this?
[26-Oct-2014 20:14:53]  <BGTB2005> Rin always is, but she'd like to gather more information
[26-Oct-2014 20:15:34]  <Rig> Is there anyway we can sneak onto the roof?
[26-Oct-2014 20:15:43]  <ponicalica> Metal Gear Kazuki
[26-Oct-2014 20:16:11]  <IllFlower> There's the usual door to the roof, although it's locked from the inside of the building.
[26-Oct-2014 20:16:53]  <ponicalica> Ayako's magic key? ;)
[26-Oct-2014 20:17:06]  <Rig> Maybe, or Rin could fly up and try to hide where she can listen.
[26-Oct-2014 20:17:42]  <BGTB2005> she could
[26-Oct-2014 20:18:13]  <Alicia> Even though she just wants to punch Karasuma.
[26-Oct-2014 20:18:38]  <ponicalica> conflict: Rin vs her desire to just burn the fucker
[26-Oct-2014 20:19:00]  <Alicia> Hikari and Kazuki gotta hold her back
[26-Oct-2014 20:19:08]  <Rig> We could use magic to scale the side of the building and hide just under the roof's edge.
[26-Oct-2014 20:19:39]  <IllFlower> Someone would probably notice you.
[26-Oct-2014 20:20:39]  <ponicalica> Are there things on the roof we could hide behind?
[26-Oct-2014 20:21:44]  <IllFlower> The entrance portal.
[26-Oct-2014 20:22:12]  <Rig> Okay, yeah, I'm gonna say that Rin or Ayako should do this.
[26-Oct-2014 20:22:38]  <Alicia> Ayako.
[26-Oct-2014 20:23:26]  <ponicalica> Ayako checks the door, sees that it's locked, and pulls out her key once again.
[26-Oct-2014 20:24:08]  <IllFlower> If we're gonna conflict this, we should make that part of the conflict.
[26-Oct-2014 20:24:42]  <ponicalica> Oops, fair enough.
[26-Oct-2014 20:24:56]  <Rig> Yeah.
[26-Oct-2014 20:25:14]  <IllFlower> I guess we'll just go ahead and play this as a demonic influence conflict?
[26-Oct-2014 20:25:21]  <ponicalica> I'm up for a conflict.  Stakes being hear their plan without being caught or
[26-Oct-2014 20:25:30]  <IllFlower> Yeah, essentially.
[26-Oct-2014 20:27:17]  <IllFlower> So we'll open at physical, Bd + Ht.

[26-Oct-2014 20:32:16]  <IllFlower> All right, go ahead and raise.
[26-Oct-2014 20:35:13]  <Rig> 6 4 > Ayako throws open the door and glares at the group.
[26-Oct-2014 20:35:28]  <ponicalica> Ayako tries to walk up the stairs as quietly as she can, and subtly manipulates the shadows cast by the entrance to try to hide her presence.
[26-Oct-2014 20:35:32]  <ponicalica> (Is this suitable?)
[26-Oct-2014 20:36:22]  <IllFlower> I'm not quite sure how to react to that one.
[26-Oct-2014 20:36:26]  <Alicia> (One of these days, Ayako will teach Hikari how to use light magix.)
[26-Oct-2014 20:36:48]  <IllFlower> Maybe she pokes her head out of the door and tries her best to keep it from creaking or something.
[26-Oct-2014 20:37:48]  <ponicalica> hmm
[26-Oct-2014 20:38:09]  <ponicalica> yeah, that'll do
[26-Oct-2014 20:38:58]  <ponicalica> Ayako slowly opens the door, trying her best to muffle the creaking made by its opening, and pokes her head out to look for the culprits.

[26-Oct-2014 20:42:02]  <IllFlower> The door, of course, emits a horrible screech the moment it's open wide enough to see anything. It's as if this door's hinges haven't been lubricated for the past forty years.

[26-Oct-2014 20:44:33]  <BGTB2005> could light magic help?
[26-Oct-2014 20:45:46]  <ponicalica> Ayako realizes that the boys are focusing on the door.  In a last-ditch attempt to avoid detection, she pushes the door to make it squeak louder and then dives to the ground where she might not be noticed.

[26-Oct-2014 20:46:36]  <ponicalica> yeah.  3d6, right?
[26-Oct-2014 20:46:43]  <IllFlower> Because if you don't you can always just give.
[26-Oct-2014 20:47:34]  <ponicalica> Actually, I guess the question is if I would be able to use light powers to further hide from their view now that they're all focused on the door.  Otherwise, yeah, give
[26-Oct-2014 20:47:51]  <BGTB2005> turning invisible is just a highly specialised application of light magic, right?
[26-Oct-2014 20:48:15]  <IllFlower> Well, the conflict's over, your cover's basically blown.
[26-Oct-2014 20:48:31]  <ponicalica> Okay then, yeah, just give I guess, no fallout

[26-Oct-2014 20:49:51]  <IllFlower> Ayako finds herself in the unenviable position of being stared at by three not-exactly-friendly-looking boys her age.
[26-Oct-2014 20:50:11]  <Rig> I like that our non-violent approaches absolutely never work.
[26-Oct-2014 20:50:18]  <IllFlower> None of them appear to be Karasuma.
[26-Oct-2014 20:50:51]  <ponicalica> Rig: we saved Yumiko
[26-Oct-2014 20:50:52]  <IllFlower> One of the boys, a shorter one leaning against the railing, shouts to her.
[26-Oct-2014 20:51:13]  <IllFlower> "Get lost," he says, quite plainly.
[26-Oct-2014 20:51:21]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Yeah, at the expense of her ankle.
[26-Oct-2014 20:51:22]  <Alicia> Wow, rude.
[26-Oct-2014 20:51:44]  <Alicia> Show a Conservator some respect.
[26-Oct-2014 20:54:27]  <ponicalica> Ayako freezes up for a second, confused as to Karasuma's absence.
[26-Oct-2014 20:55:34]  <IllFlower> Are none of the other Conservators going to help the poor girl out?
[26-Oct-2014 20:56:03]  <Rig> Couldn't she just excuse herself and get lost?
[26-Oct-2014 20:56:03]  <ponicalica> "D-do you know where a Karasuma is?"
[26-Oct-2014 20:56:31]  <ponicalica> Ayako gets lost.  She no longer knows where she is.  She asks a nearby local directions back to Shii's castle.
[26-Oct-2014 20:56:37]  <ponicalica> or church or whatever
[26-Oct-2014 20:56:47]  <BGTB2005> pfffff
[26-Oct-2014 20:56:59]  <Rig> Your Shii is in another castle.
[26-Oct-2014 20:57:00]  <Alicia> (Sec, gotta help mom with something.)
[26-Oct-2014 20:58:04]  <IllFlower> One of the other boys laughs. "She looks like she just walked out of a comic book."
[26-Oct-2014 20:58:27]  <IllFlower> "Maybe I do, maybe I don't," the first boy says. "What's it to you? You his girlfriend?"
[26-Oct-2014 20:58:54]  <IllFlower> "Like hell he has a girlfriend." More laughter.
[26-Oct-2014 20:59:08]  <Rig> Totally a conflict now.
[26-Oct-2014 21:00:51]  <Alicia> (Okay, groceries in.)
[26-Oct-2014 21:01:19]  <IllFlower> I'd be down for a follow-up.
[26-Oct-2014 21:03:10]  <Alicia> Same.

[26-Oct-2014 21:04:10]  <BGTB2005> sure
[26-Oct-2014 21:04:25]  <Rig> Should anyone else join in?
[26-Oct-2014 21:06:12]  <IllFlower> What are even the stakes?
[26-Oct-2014 21:06:22]  <IllFlower> Get 'em to tell the Conservators where Karasuma is?
[26-Oct-2014 21:06:25]  <Rig> Yeah.
[26-Oct-2014 21:06:40]  <ponicalica> And then their stakes are probably beating up Ayako for being such a nerd
[26-Oct-2014 21:06:51]  <Rig> That's not a very good stake.
[26-Oct-2014 21:07:05]  <Rig> They'd just lie and lead us on a wild goose chase if they won.
[26-Oct-2014 21:07:31]  <IllFlower> ARE YOU THE GM RIG
[26-Oct-2014 21:07:49]  <IllFlower> That being said, we're going to basically do what he said.
[26-Oct-2014 21:07:56]  <Rig> :)
[26-Oct-2014 21:08:06]  <IllFlower> So who's in?
[26-Oct-2014 21:08:37]  <Rig> Might as well have Kazuki show up wondering what the hell the screaming was.
[26-Oct-2014 21:08:55]  <Rig> "I thought you'd started murdering them, but I guess the door just needs greased.
[26-Oct-2014 21:08:57]  <Rig> *"
[26-Oct-2014 21:11:45]  <Rig> Kazuki and Ayako vs The Bullies
[26-Oct-2014 21:11:46]  <Rig> Go.
[26-Oct-2014 21:11:49]  <BGTB2005> Rin will try to help
[26-Oct-2014 21:12:07]  <ponicalica> ("These guys look like bullies to me.  Let me set them on fire!")
[26-Oct-2014 21:12:22]  <IllFlower> Magic isn't really effective against civilians.
[26-Oct-2014 21:12:54]  <Alicia> Not sure whether Hikari should join in or not. It's not like they're misusing magykx or anything.
[26-Oct-2014 21:13:04]  <Alicia> Just a bunch of losers mucking about.
[26-Oct-2014 21:13:20]  <IllFlower> We should consider how much trouble Ayako *appears* to be in as well.
[26-Oct-2014 21:13:37]  <IllFlower> Kazuki would probably have a reason to butt in seeing as how he's not exactly great on trust.
[26-Oct-2014 21:14:18]  <Rig> Yeah, last time Kazuki let Ayako handle someone she threw them through a window.
[26-Oct-2014 21:14:20]  <Alicia> Hm. Hikari could come in to see what all the fuss was about.
[26-Oct-2014 21:14:24]  <Rig> Let's not toss them off a roof.
[26-Oct-2014 21:14:33]  <Alicia> And also to deal with Ayako in case she gets flustered.
[26-Oct-2014 21:14:41]  <Alicia> Which is basically Ayako?
[26-Oct-2014 21:15:50]  <ponicalica> I forget, since the 3→2 Ht was a temporary thing, do I return it to 3?

[26-Oct-2014 21:20:42]  <IllFlower> Okay, done. Sorry about that.
[26-Oct-2014 21:21:22]  <IllFlower> So who's in and not in? I'm gonna go with Ayako and Kazuki if no one objects.
[26-Oct-2014 21:21:31]  <Rig> I'm good with that.
[26-Oct-2014 21:21:38]  <ponicalica> Okay.
[26-Oct-2014 21:22:34]  <IllFlower> Let me make an NPC for the group here.
[26-Oct-2014 21:22:40]  <Rig> Yeah.
[26-Oct-2014 21:23:43]  <Alicia> Just those two?
[26-Oct-2014 21:23:53]  <BGTB2005> I guess Hikari and Rin will just stand back and do whatever it is they do when not needed in conflict?
[26-Oct-2014 21:24:03]  <Rig> Talk shit about Kazuki.
[26-Oct-2014 21:25:07]  <Alicia> Heh.
[26-Oct-2014 21:26:01]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's get started. Talking, yes?

[26-Oct-2014 21:28:10]  <ponicalica> okay
[26-Oct-2014 21:29:46]  <ponicalica> now the question is: how to ask
[26-Oct-2014 21:30:21]  <Rig> Ayako tries to pull herself together and look confident. "Look, I need to know where he is. Can you tell me or not?"
[26-Oct-2014 21:30:24]  <Rig> ?
[26-Oct-2014 21:30:44]  <ponicalica> That works.

[26-Oct-2014 21:31:13]  <Rig> You could also maybe roll for taking charge.

[26-Oct-2014 21:52:53]  <ponicalica> yeah, I think I didn't get enough hype.  Or maybe caffeine.
[26-Oct-2014 21:53:05]  <Alicia> I'm just off today
[26-Oct-2014 21:53:54]  <IllFlower> Let's move on to the next round, then. ponicalica, you have the floor.
[26-Oct-2014 21:54:00]  <IllFlower> Then myself, then Rig, by order of dice.

[26-Oct-2014 22:05:58]  <IllFlower> The one boy who hasn't spoken to this point chimes in. "As if we'd believe you're a teacher. You're here with some girl who doesn't even wear our school's uniform. And, well, you don't look like you can take a punch."
[26-Oct-2014 22:06:20]  <IllFlower> And so he swings one. Time for me to escalate...

[26-Oct-2014 22:08:26]  <Alicia> Wow these kids.
[26-Oct-2014 22:08:34]  <Rig> Kazuki gives. He's not gonna fight kids. He grabs Ayako by the shoulder and pulls her through the door, closing it behind them and locking it.
[26-Oct-2014 22:08:39]  <Rig> You're giving too.
[26-Oct-2014 22:08:41]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: As long as you have enough dice and don't start swinging yourself on raises, you technically don't have to escalate.
[26-Oct-2014 22:08:51]  <Rig> We're not fighting kids. :P
[26-Oct-2014 22:09:01]  <IllFlower> I dunno, Ayako's got witchbrain.
[26-Oct-2014 22:09:04]  <BGTB2005> Ayako can handle herself
[26-Oct-2014 22:09:11]  <Alicia> IF just got cockblocked by maturity.
[26-Oct-2014 22:09:16]  <Rig> Well, you can always burst through the door and murderlate those kids.
[26-Oct-2014 22:09:19]  <IllFlower> And 9d6 in the appropriate stats.
[26-Oct-2014 22:10:07]  <ponicalica> I kind of want to but I kind of don't.
[26-Oct-2014 22:11:16]  <Alicia> Rin wants to murderlate them, sure, but Hikari...
[26-Oct-2014 22:11:27]  <BGTB2005> but Rin's not involved
[26-Oct-2014 22:11:35]  <Alicia> Yes.
[26-Oct-2014 22:12:03]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Which "kind of" is stronger?
[26-Oct-2014 22:12:29]  <Alicia> "Railing boy, Comic book guy, That other one" lmao.
[26-Oct-2014 22:12:32]  <Alicia> "That other one"
[26-Oct-2014 22:12:39]  <ponicalica> Ayako considers struggling against Kazuki pulling her away--running from violence is something that clearly causes problems later on, and these kids might be the way to Karasuma, but on the other hand, the last fight she got into with initiates ended up with her unable to remember, and these kids don't even seem like initiates...
[26-Oct-2014 22:13:38]  <Rig> "Ayako, come on. They aren't gonna help us now." Kazuki pulls at her sleeve some more. He wants to get out of this school before authorities show up to another one of their missions.
[26-Oct-2014 22:13:40]  <ponicalica> ...and of course, the last time she got out of step with Kazuki, it led to the confrontation that she can't even remember
[26-Oct-2014 22:14:00]  <IllFlower> (Kazuki slaps Ayako. "GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF!")
[26-Oct-2014 22:14:03]  <ponicalica> "Mmhmm, you're probably right.  Let's get out of here."
[26-Oct-2014 22:14:46]  <Rig> The two of them make quick headway away from the trio banging at the locked door. They'll probably be found before nightfall.
[26-Oct-2014 22:15:11]  <Alicia> Lol.
[26-Oct-2014 22:16:04]  <IllFlower> Well, that went surprisingly nonviolently.
[26-Oct-2014 22:16:04]  <ponicalica> kazuki's harsh
[26-Oct-2014 22:16:20]  <IllFlower> So what's the plan now?
[26-Oct-2014 22:16:42]  <Rig> Well, we didn't get a lot of information out of that, but no one died. So that's super cool.
[26-Oct-2014 22:17:01]  <Alicia> Rin is disappointed she couldn't burn their asses.
[26-Oct-2014 22:17:02]  <BGTB2005> do we know anyone else who knows Karasuma?
[26-Oct-2014 22:17:16]  <Rig> How about we see about tracking down one of the initiates that claimed to be threatened by Karasuma.
[26-Oct-2014 22:17:18]  <Rig> *?
[26-Oct-2014 22:17:43]  <IllFlower> Miho knows some stuff.
[26-Oct-2014 22:17:53]  <Rig> I'd be up for talking to Miho some more.
[26-Oct-2014 22:18:13]  <Alicia> Ooh boy.
[26-Oct-2014 22:18:30]  <IllFlower> Back to the unnervingly normal apartment?
[26-Oct-2014 22:18:50]  <Rig> More tea!
[26-Oct-2014 22:18:59]  <BGTB2005> yes
[26-Oct-2014 22:19:08]  <BGTB2005> maybe cookies too
[26-Oct-2014 22:19:10]  <Alicia> Hikari will be overjoyed, for sure.
[26-Oct-2014 22:19:17]  <ponicalica> I was going to make a cookie comment but BGTB2005 beat me to it
[26-Oct-2014 22:19:45]  <Rig> Shii never makes tea.
[26-Oct-2014 22:19:46]  <Rig> It's a shame.
[26-Oct-2014 22:19:55]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[26-Oct-2014 22:20:18]  <Alicia> I'm sure you could ask Hikari to bring some stuff for the next meet.
[26-Oct-2014 22:20:25]  <IllFlower> FFWD>>
[26-Oct-2014 22:20:29]  <IllFlower> "So how'd it go?" Miho says, taking a sip of tea with one eyebrow raised.
[26-Oct-2014 22:20:50]  <Rig> "No lasting injuries," Kazuki says with a relieved smile.
[26-Oct-2014 22:20:55]  <ponicalica> "We found his friends.  They don't seem like very pleasant people."

[26-Oct-2014 22:23:19]  <Rig> "Instead of talking to his allies, let's talk to his victims."
[26-Oct-2014 22:23:38]  <IllFlower> Miho puts down her teacup. "It's a shame you didn't give them a good roughing up. I'm sure they deserved one, even if they have nothing to do with Karasuma's behavior."
[26-Oct-2014 22:23:54]  <Rig> Kazuki gives Miho a sour look.
[26-Oct-2014 22:24:19]  <IllFlower> "I'm just speaking from experience," Miho says.

[26-Oct-2014 22:25:44]  <Rig> "What is the alternative?" he asks hesitantly.
[26-Oct-2014 22:27:12]  <IllFlower> "Going down without a fight. Sometimes... permanently... down."

[26-Oct-2014 22:35:55]  <Rig> Kazuki introduces himself and the other Conservators as the boy sits down at the table.
[26-Oct-2014 22:36:18]  <IllFlower> He takes a seat at the table as Asacchi lays out another cup of tea for him, which he seems to ignore. "Right, I'm Ishigaki. I heard you wanted to talk about Karasuma?" he asks the Conservators.
[26-Oct-2014 22:36:56]  <ponicalica> "Mmhmm.  We tried to reach him through his friends at his school.  That didn't work out."

[26-Oct-2014 22:38:45]  <IllFlower> "Well, he gave me these," Ishigaki says, pointing to his face.
[26-Oct-2014 22:38:46]  <IllFlower> "I don't know if he has a plan or if he's just on a power trip.
[26-Oct-2014 22:39:07]  <IllFlower> "Actually, no, I take that back. He has a plan. It just covers what *not* to do."
[26-Oct-2014 22:41:47]  <Rig> "What not to do?"
[26-Oct-2014 22:42:21]  <IllFlower> "Nothing magical. At least not openly.
[26-Oct-2014 22:43:04]  <IllFlower> "I think he's got some initiates on his side, though. Ones we don't know, and I imagine we don't want to."
[26-Oct-2014 22:43:37]  <Rig> Kazuki sips at his tea, considering options.
[26-Oct-2014 22:44:17]  <Alicia> (Very thirsty today.)
[26-Oct-2014 22:44:28]  <BGTB2005> (it's good tea)
[26-Oct-2014 22:45:28]  <Rig> Kazuki likes tea.
[26-Oct-2014 22:45:52]  <IllFlower> "It's a little weird sitting with four other people when only one of them talks," Ishigaki whispers to Miho. "And only barely at that."
[26-Oct-2014 22:46:27]  <Rig> Tell me about it.
[26-Oct-2014 22:46:28]  <ponicalica> sorry, I was letting Rig take it, since I knew he had some plans/ideas/etc
[26-Oct-2014 22:46:39]  <Rig> I was kind of hoping someone else would step in.
[26-Oct-2014 22:46:46]  <Alicia> Oh.
[26-Oct-2014 22:46:51]  <Rig> Because otherwise it is literally just Kazuki making plans all the time.
[26-Oct-2014 22:47:07]  <Rig> And the only plan I had was to get more information.
[26-Oct-2014 22:48:05]  <BGTB2005> "Do you happen to know where Karasuma lives?"
[26-Oct-2014 22:48:24]  <Alicia> "Well, I'm... not sure." Hikari begins. "His friends were useless, and we weren't even able to find him, short of-" She's cut off by Rin's idea.
[26-Oct-2014 22:48:33]  <BGTB2005> "Or any other places he frequents?"
[26-Oct-2014 22:48:44]  <ponicalica> "Well, we tried school, and got nothing..."
[26-Oct-2014 22:49:13]  <IllFlower> "I heard that occasionally he hangs out at the arcade near the train station," Ishigaki says.
[26-Oct-2014 22:50:08]  <Rig> "Sorta stereotypical," Kazuki mumbles.
[26-Oct-2014 22:50:25]  <ponicalica> train station, huh
[26-Oct-2014 22:50:34]  <ponicalica> makes me think of the trainyard that Juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun died in
[26-Oct-2014 22:50:39]  <Rig> "Is there anything we can do for you in the meantime? Do you think he'll make another pass at you?"
[26-Oct-2014 22:51:07]  <IllFlower> "The stereotypes exist for a reason," Miho says.
[26-Oct-2014 22:51:24]  <Alicia> "Or anyone else he might be making moves towards attacking?"
[26-Oct-2014 22:53:14]  <IllFlower> Then, from Ishigaki: "I have a feeling he'll be backing off from anyone in our branch for a little while, at least. Karasuma probably knows by now that you've talked to Asacchi and gone looking for him. Who knows how long that'll last, or if he's got other initiates to take it out on."
[26-Oct-2014 22:53:33]  <ponicalica> "Let's find him before he does something rash, then."
[26-Oct-2014 22:53:41]  <Rig> "Thank you for you help."
[26-Oct-2014 22:54:26]  <IllFlower> "I should be thanking you," Ishigaki says.
[26-Oct-2014 22:55:01]  <ponicalica> man how often has a conservator gotten thanked
[26-Oct-2014 22:55:36]  <IllFlower> Any Conservator, or these specific Conservators? ;)
[26-Oct-2014 22:55:51]  <BGTB2005> yes(?)
[26-Oct-2014 22:57:02]  <Alicia> We're improviiiiing.
[26-Oct-2014 22:57:04]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: the former but especially the latter
[26-Oct-2014 22:57:46]  <IllFlower> Oh, people love Conservators. When they're not immolating people to death.
[26-Oct-2014 22:58:10]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I think this is a good place to wrap up for now, unless anyone's got closing thoughts.
[26-Oct-2014 22:58:20]  <BGTB2005> "Oh, one more question, just out of curiosity; has Karasuma called any of his attacks 'fitness tests'?"
[26-Oct-2014 22:58:59]  <IllFlower> "What's that?" Ishigaki asks. "Some kind of martial arts thing?"
[26-Oct-2014 22:59:23]  <ponicalica> wrong cult
[26-Oct-2014 22:59:40]  <ponicalica> "It's a thing we saw from another cult.  A particular bullying tactic."
[26-Oct-2014 23:01:01]  <ponicalica> "Make sure they're 'ready' by launching nasty magic at them."

[26-Oct-2014 23:01:46]  <IllFlower> "Never heard of it," Ishigaki says.
[26-Oct-2014 23:02:03]  <Alicia> Miho doesn't like us
[26-Oct-2014 23:02:34]  <Rig> Miho doesn't like Hikari.
[26-Oct-2014 23:02:46]  <Alicia> <_< >_>
[26-Oct-2014 23:02:52]  <Rig> Are we wrapping this here?
[26-Oct-2014 23:03:12]  <IllFlower> I'm good.
[26-Oct-2014 23:03:28]  <Rig> Okay. Thanks for running this.
[26-Oct-2014 23:03:34]  <Rig> It was fun to not kill anyone.
[26-Oct-2014 23:03:41]  <IllFlower> Sure. Thanks for playing, everyone. We'll be back in two weeks.
