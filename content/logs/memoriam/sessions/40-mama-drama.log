[31-Jan-2015 20:11:46]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Firing the guy who made "magical Baha Men" jokes out of a cannon.
[31-Jan-2015 20:12:15]  <IllFlower> Last time, we left off with the group trying to talk Chiaki through what being an initiate is like.
[31-Jan-2015 20:12:41]  <IllFlower> Anything left to pick up with there?
[31-Jan-2015 20:14:22]  <Rig> Don't see anything super pressing.
[31-Jan-2015 20:14:42]  <Alicia> I... don't think so.
[31-Jan-2015 20:14:45]  <IllFlower> Okay, then on we march.
[31-Jan-2015 20:16:02]  <IllFlower> After thanking the Conservators for their help, Chiaki goes home with Rin.
[31-Jan-2015 20:16:19]  <Rig> ^_~
[31-Jan-2015 20:16:54]  <IllFlower> The next morning is a Sunday, but any plans to sleep in that anyone may have had are wrecked by a seven o'clock summons from Shii.
[31-Jan-2015 20:19:02]  <IllFlower> A tense silence pervades the room as she waits for everyone to arrive.
[31-Jan-2015 20:19:47]  <IllFlower> The familiar doesn't even verbally greet her initiates when they walk in, merely glancing at them and nodding.
[31-Jan-2015 20:20:44]  <IllFlower> Hikari is the last to enter. After about thirty quiet seconds, Shii finally speaks.
[31-Jan-2015 20:21:12]  <IllFlower> "There's no good way to deliver this news. Two initiates were killed overnight."
[31-Jan-2015 20:21:25]  <Rig> This swung rapidly.
[31-Jan-2015 20:21:30]  <BGTB2005> D:
[31-Jan-2015 20:21:33]  <ponicalica> welp
[31-Jan-2015 20:21:56]  <Alicia> Hikari lets out a short gasp. "How... what happened?"
[31-Jan-2015 20:25:39]  <ponicalica> "Do we have any ideas on a culprit?"
[31-Jan-2015 20:25:59]  <IllFlower> "They were found dead on a residential street in Kumagawa ward. A Conservator patrolling the area saw signs of a battle and rushed to the scene - too late, unfortunately.
[31-Jan-2015 20:26:48]  <IllFlower> "The victims show obvious signs of being killed in an ambush. I won't get into the particular details of the condition they were found in, but suffice it to say it was very deliberate and very unpleasant.
[31-Jan-2015 20:27:15]  <IllFlower> "There aren't any leads on a suspect. Whoever was responsible knew how to avoid leaving evidence."
[31-Jan-2015 20:28:33]  <IllFlower> Rin's heart skips at the mention of Kumagawa. She lives there, after all.
[31-Jan-2015 20:30:56]  <BGTB2005> "Do... do we know who the victims are?"
[31-Jan-2015 20:31:15]  <IllFlower> Shii continues. "The two initiates' names were Takumi Oonishi and Hiroko Shimamura. Both eighteen years of age, and both, unfortunately enough, initiates for less than ten days when they were killed."
[31-Jan-2015 20:32:03]  <ponicalica> no twinge of recognition here, right?
[31-Jan-2015 20:32:09]  <IllFlower> No.
[31-Jan-2015 20:32:23]  <Rig> "Are we being assigned to investigate this one?"
[31-Jan-2015 20:34:07]  <IllFlower> "Not formally. At least not yet. My superiors are in some disarray.
[31-Jan-2015 20:34:49]  <IllFlower> "They're a bit shocked at how new the victims were. Understandably."
[31-Jan-2015 20:36:16]  <IllFlower> Shii pauses for a second, then continues, "I'll let you know if and when the time comes."
[31-Jan-2015 20:36:59]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:6839:85e6:d8a1:f09f> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 198 seconds)
[31-Jan-2015 20:37:16]  <IllFlower> The color seems to have drained from Shii's fluffy face, which was already pretty white to begin with.
[31-Jan-2015 20:37:20]  <Rig> I assume Kumagawa isn't far from any of us?
[31-Jan-2015 20:37:38]  <IllFlower> Rin lives there, so it's within commuting distance.
[31-Jan-2015 20:37:39]  <ponicalica> Rin lives there, apparently
[31-Jan-2015 20:38:33]  <Rig> Kazuki looks over at Rin.
[31-Jan-2015 20:38:40]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:6839:85e6:d8a1:f09f> has joined #madokamadness
[31-Jan-2015 20:38:55]  <Rig> He thinks about asking her if she's all right, but isn't really sure how to.
[31-Jan-2015 20:39:17]  <IllFlower> Try tsundere.
[31-Jan-2015 20:39:32]  <Rig> ("It's not like I care, but are you okay?")
[31-Jan-2015 20:39:36]  <ponicalica> basically
[31-Jan-2015 20:39:51]  <ponicalica> ("In my official capacity as a Conservator, not any personal feelings, are you okay?")
[31-Jan-2015 20:40:00]  <IllFlower> That's just bureaucratic.
[31-Jan-2015 20:40:23]  <Rig> "Rin, your friend was thinking about becoming an initiate, right?"
[31-Jan-2015 20:41:25]  <ponicalica> "The one who came in yesterday?"
[31-Jan-2015 20:41:28]  <Rig> "Maybe it's a good idea if she turns it down."
[31-Jan-2015 20:41:45]  <BGTB2005> "Yeah..."
[31-Jan-2015 20:42:21]  <Alicia> "It wouldn't be a good idea to put her in any unnecessary danger, Rin."
[31-Jan-2015 20:43:59]  <ponicalica> "At least until we figure out who's behind these murders."
[31-Jan-2015 20:44:03]  <IllFlower> "What's this about?" Shii asks.
[31-Jan-2015 20:45:40]  <Rig> Kazuki remembers his doubts about talking to Rin's friend about this at all.
[31-Jan-2015 20:45:48]  <Rig> He briefly wonders if they'll be in trouble.
[31-Jan-2015 20:46:03]  <Rig> But considering murders, there are bigger fish.
[31-Jan-2015 20:46:57]  <Alicia> "Yesterday Rin brought in one of her friends, who had been asked if she wanted to become an initiate... so we shared some details with her."
[31-Jan-2015 20:47:05]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[31-Jan-2015 20:47:25]  <Alicia> Hikari pauses. "She didn't quite take to it, it seemed like."
[31-Jan-2015 20:49:46]  <IllFlower> Shii nods. "It'd be for the best if she held back for now.
[31-Jan-2015 20:50:06]  <ponicalica> of course, for maximum irony points, she probably just contracted
[31-Jan-2015 20:50:09]  <IllFlower> "Does Rin's friend live in that area as well? This doesn't feel right."
[31-Jan-2015 20:52:11]  <IllFlower> (She does, of course.)
[31-Jan-2015 20:52:37]  <Rig> "I would assume," Kazuki says, looking to Rin for confirmation.
[31-Jan-2015 20:53:33]  <Rig> "Should we check up on her?"
[31-Jan-2015 20:53:57]  <BGTB2005> "She moved there not too long ago..."
[31-Jan-2015 20:54:00]  <ponicalica> "Probably, if Rin doesn't think this'll spook her too much"
[31-Jan-2015 20:54:18]  <Rig> "Probably shouldn't mention the murders..."
[31-Jan-2015 20:55:07]  <ponicalica> "If we could get in contact with her potential familiar as well, that might also be worthwhile."
[31-Jan-2015 20:55:20]  <IllFlower> At this exact moment, Rin's phone rings. Guess who!
[31-Jan-2015 20:55:56]  <Rig> Rin's mom?
[31-Jan-2015 20:56:01]  <ponicalica> definitely one of her old bullies
[31-Jan-2015 20:56:05]  <Rig> Totally Shii.
[31-Jan-2015 20:56:06]  <BGTB2005> is it chiaki
[31-Jan-2015 20:56:13]  <Rig> Shii is calling Rin from inside the house.
[31-Jan-2015 20:57:29]  <IllFlower> "Rin, you have to help me out here!"
[31-Jan-2015 20:57:31]  <IllFlower> Chiaki's voice is positively trying to claw its way out of the phone in desperation.
[31-Jan-2015 20:57:42]  <BGTB2005> Rin checks and answers
[31-Jan-2015 20:57:46]  <BGTB2005> "Hello?"
[31-Jan-2015 20:57:56]  <ponicalica> Chiaki uses her newfound powers to escape out of the other side of the phone
[31-Jan-2015 20:59:01]  <IllFlower> "I-- I-- Rin, the school called this morning to tell me that two of my classmates died and--"
[31-Jan-2015 21:00:49]  <IllFlower> Her voice is loud enough that Rin has to hold the phone away from her ear in order to make anything out that's not a lump of distorted noise.
[31-Jan-2015 21:03:16]  <Rig> Kazuki is caught between being amused at this situation and genuinely concerned.
[31-Jan-2015 21:03:27]  <IllFlower> You're a terrible person, Kazuki.
[31-Jan-2015 21:03:42]  <Rig> It's too cliche to not laugh.
[31-Jan-2015 21:04:57]  <IllFlower> Just don't laugh too loudly.
[31-Jan-2015 21:04:58]  <Alicia> How mean.
[31-Jan-2015 21:05:13]  <ponicalica> Just because Kazuki has high Ht doesn't mean he's not a mean person.
[31-Jan-2015 21:05:56]  <Alicia> True~
[31-Jan-2015 21:05:58]  <BGTB2005> Rin glances at the others, unsure of how to respond and wondering if they overheard anything
[31-Jan-2015 21:06:08]  <Rig> "Rin?" he decides to venture.
[31-Jan-2015 21:11:15]  <Rig> "Is your friend okay?"
[31-Jan-2015 21:12:09]  <IllFlower> Is *Rin* okay?
[31-Jan-2015 21:12:19]  <ponicalica> is Rin ever okay?
[31-Jan-2015 21:13:09]  <BGTB2005> "I... I don't know," Rin answers Kazuki
[31-Jan-2015 21:14:29]  <IllFlower> So what's the plan?
[31-Jan-2015 21:14:48]  <BGTB2005> i dunno
[31-Jan-2015 21:14:53]  <BGTB2005> visit Chiaki?
[31-Jan-2015 21:14:53]  <Alicia> I'd say go see what's up.
[31-Jan-2015 21:15:04]  <Rig> Visiting her sounds like a good idea.
[31-Jan-2015 21:15:14]  <Rig> Though explaining why we all visited her should be fun.
[31-Jan-2015 21:15:18]  <Rig> "We were so worried!"
[31-Jan-2015 21:15:20]  <Rig> "Why?"
[31-Jan-2015 21:15:24]  <Rig> "Oh, the murders."
[31-Jan-2015 21:15:31]  <Alicia> Snicker.
[31-Jan-2015 21:15:40]  <IllFlower> I'm pretty sure you guys can explain this.
[31-Jan-2015 21:15:53]  <IllFlower> Well, I hope.
[31-Jan-2015 21:16:10]  <ponicalica> well, we want to avoid freaking her out too much, but that ship may have already sailed
[31-Jan-2015 21:16:57]  <IllFlower> Rin finally manages to calm Chiaki down for long enough to say that she's on her way there.
[31-Jan-2015 21:17:29]  <IllFlower> She tries to mention that the others might be joining her, but she's not sure if that part get through.
[31-Jan-2015 21:19:43]  <IllFlower> Chiaki's house is about fifteen minutes' walk from the nearest train station, in a hilly part of town. It looks like a pretty typical Sunday morning scene: dogs on walks, people on jogs, the occasional friendly old person.
[31-Jan-2015 21:19:52]  <ponicalica> that's code for "it didn't get through" isn't it :p
[31-Jan-2015 21:20:09]  <Rig> "dogs on walks" fucking jokester.
[31-Jan-2015 21:20:48]  <IllFlower> It's all a bit familiarly dissonant. Maybe more than a bit.
[31-Jan-2015 21:20:55]  <IllFlower> Rig: Eh?
[31-Jan-2015 21:21:15]  <Rig> The emgirls are "Dogs" walking to some place.
[31-Jan-2015 21:21:24]  <IllFlower> `_`
[31-Jan-2015 21:21:30]  <IllFlower> I should kick you.
[31-Jan-2015 21:21:33]  <ponicalica> initiates, Rig, don't be so sexist :p
[31-Jan-2015 21:21:36]  <BGTB2005> i want to think this one wasn't intentional
[31-Jan-2015 21:21:44]  <Rig> ¬.¬
[31-Jan-2015 21:23:31]  <IllFlower> Chiaki's mother answers the door.
[31-Jan-2015 21:24:01]  <ponicalica> "Hello, is Chiaki home?"
[31-Jan-2015 21:24:05]  <IllFlower> "Come in," she says to Rin. "Are these your classmates?"
[31-Jan-2015 21:25:53]  <ponicalica> ("Man, the male one seems so old... did he get *whispers* held back?")
[31-Jan-2015 21:26:10]  <IllFlower> He has a baby face.
[31-Jan-2015 21:27:07]  <Rig> Baby-faced Kazoo is his gangster name or something.
[31-Jan-2015 21:27:23]  <Alicia> lol.
[31-Jan-2015 21:27:26]  <ponicalica> lol
[31-Jan-2015 21:27:33]  <BGTB2005> lol
[31-Jan-2015 21:27:58]  <IllFlower> NO LOL
[31-Jan-2015 21:28:15]  <Alicia> :C
[31-Jan-2015 21:29:36]  <BGTB2005> "Yeah," Rin answers
[31-Jan-2015 21:30:29]  <IllFlower> "Chiaki's upstairs in her room." Chiaki's mother gestures gently towards the staircase.
[31-Jan-2015 21:31:50]  <IllFlower> "Thanks for coming by. My condolences..."
[31-Jan-2015 21:32:25]  <Rig> condolences?
[31-Jan-2015 21:33:10]  <IllFlower> She thinks you're classmates of the victims. Also a bit mixed up right now.
[31-Jan-2015 21:33:17]  <Rig> ah
[31-Jan-2015 21:34:45]  <IllFlower> Chiaki's response to Rin's knock at her bedroom door is a simple, listless "It's open."
[31-Jan-2015 21:35:50]  <IllFlower> She's sitting on top of a messy futon, staring through the window.
[31-Jan-2015 21:38:33]  <IllFlower> I hope the Conservators aren't just going to stand in the doorway staring at her.
[31-Jan-2015 21:39:18]  <ponicalica> I was waiting for Rin to take the lead what with it being her big sis esque figure
[31-Jan-2015 21:39:30]  <ponicalica> but BGTB2005 is kind of a slow typer
[31-Jan-2015 21:39:37]  <BGTB2005> Rin approaches and hugs Chiaki
[31-Jan-2015 21:39:46]  *** CentralAve is now known as MabelAvenue
[31-Jan-2015 21:41:07]  <IllFlower> She feels Chiaki go tense for a second, then relax.
[31-Jan-2015 21:41:24]  <IllFlower> Chiaki smiles and returns the hug. The skin around her eyes is a bit red, Rin notices.
[31-Jan-2015 21:41:30]  <Rig> And now we fight a witch?
[31-Jan-2015 21:41:35]  <ponicalica> ("Have you been burning your eyes?")
[31-Jan-2015 21:41:36]  <IllFlower> "Thank you," she says.
[31-Jan-2015 21:42:40]  <IllFlower> She turns to look at the other three, her smile fading slightly.
[31-Jan-2015 21:42:55]  <IllFlower> "I'm in trouble, aren't I?"
[31-Jan-2015 21:43:27]  <ponicalica> ("Unless you were the murderer, no.")
[31-Jan-2015 21:43:41]  <IllFlower> She means "danger."
[31-Jan-2015 21:44:36]  <ponicalica> "We're not sure yet."
[31-Jan-2015 21:45:47]  <IllFlower> "That answer sounds even worse," Chiaki says with as much lightheartedness as she can muster.
[31-Jan-2015 21:48:27]  <Rig> "You shouldn't be."
[31-Jan-2015 21:49:20]  <IllFlower> "Myaa was here just a little while ago. He wanted to make sure I was okay.
[31-Jan-2015 21:49:56]  <IllFlower> "Or maybe he came because he thought I needed someone to talk to. Either way."
[31-Jan-2015 21:52:04]  <IllFlower> Chiaki laughs. "Part of me wants to sign up just so I can find whoever killed Hiro and Oonishi and give them a good thrashing. I'm almost convinced I could."
[31-Jan-2015 21:53:30]  <IllFlower> Her tone of voice suggests a joke, but her hands seem to be balling themselves up into fists as she speaks.
[31-Jan-2015 21:53:46]  <Alicia> Getting Miho flashbacks
[31-Jan-2015 21:54:35]  <Rig> Kazuki watches, not wanting to jump into a situation he doesn't know, but he wants Rin to warn her friend off.
[31-Jan-2015 21:56:18]  <Alicia> "We will figure out who is behind the murders, of that I'm sure." Hikari hesitates another comment before staying silent. Talking to those that want revenge is not one of her skills, and this is Rin's business.
[31-Jan-2015 21:56:27]  <IllFlower> (Sensing Kazuki's wishes, Rin's antipathy for him overrides her reason, and she tells Chiaki to totally 100% become a magical girl because THAT JERK'S NOT TELLING ME WHAT TO DO)
[31-Jan-2015 21:58:29]  <Rig> (Please.)
[31-Jan-2015 21:59:06]  <ponicalica> "As she said.  There's a system in place for these things."
[31-Jan-2015 22:01:30]  <IllFlower> "I know. It's just... two of the people I would see six days a week for six hours a day - they're just gone now. I don't want to be the next sitting duck."
[31-Jan-2015 22:02:42]  <Rig> "I'm sure it was an accident," Kazuki says, trying his best to assuage Chiaki's worries. 
[31-Jan-2015 22:03:05]  <Rig> "I don't think you need to worry about any more deaths."
[31-Jan-2015 22:05:07]  <IllFlower> "I want to believe that. But they're not even telling us how they died." Frustration builds in Chiaki's voice. "That doesn't sound like an accident to me."
[31-Jan-2015 22:07:34]  <IllFlower> ("IT'S AN ACCIDENT OKAY NOW SHUT UP")
[31-Jan-2015 22:07:56]  <Rig> "Right now you need to be here for your classmates and your family." Kazuki says. He pauses for a moment. "And for yourself, I think. Any plans you had regarding becoming a magical girl can wait."
[31-Jan-2015 22:10:14]  <IllFlower> Chiaki looks at the futon for a while, then takes a deep breath to calm herself. "You're probably right. As much as I don't want it to be true."
[31-Jan-2015 22:10:45]  <IllFlower> The house phone rings downstairs. The group can hear Chiaki's mother answer.
[31-Jan-2015 22:10:48]  <Rig> ("I usually am.")
[31-Jan-2015 22:11:02]  <IllFlower> ("YOU FUCK")
[31-Jan-2015 22:12:28]  <BGTB2005> ("I told you he was a complete jerk.")
[31-Jan-2015 22:12:47]  <Rig> (;-; *runs from room in a tizzy*)
[31-Jan-2015 22:13:23]  <Alicia> (*Pats him on the back* "you can become less of a jerk, with time")
[31-Jan-2015 22:13:47]  <IllFlower> A few moments later, she appears in the doorway, cordless handset in tow.
[31-Jan-2015 22:14:24]  <IllFlower> "Chiaki, your homeroom teacher called. Is it okay if Ms. Kataoka comes by?"
[31-Jan-2015 22:15:55]  <Rig> ¬.¬
[31-Jan-2015 22:16:21]  <ponicalica> welp
[31-Jan-2015 22:16:24]  <IllFlower> Stop being so avoidant!
[31-Jan-2015 22:16:30]  * BGTB2005 prepares popcorn
[31-Jan-2015 22:17:11]  <IllFlower> "Later, yeah," Chiaki says. "We're going to talk for a little while longer."
[31-Jan-2015 22:17:39]  <Rig> "Katoka?" Kazuki mumbles. The name is familiar.
[31-Jan-2015 22:18:17]  * Rig skips over to his backstory document.
[31-Jan-2015 22:18:23]  <IllFlower> "Okay, I'll tell her that she can visit in the afternoon."
[31-Jan-2015 22:18:48]  <IllFlower> Chiaki's mother slips back down the stairwell.
[31-Jan-2015 22:18:55]  <IllFlower> Rig: "You know her?"
[31-Jan-2015 22:20:08]  <Rig> "I think I do," Kazuki says. "But it was a long time ago."
[31-Jan-2015 22:23:14]  <IllFlower> "Mm," Chiaki says, acknowledging but not really understanding.
[31-Jan-2015 22:24:40]  <Rig> "Anyway, it doesn't matter right now. We just want you to know that you don't need to jump into the magical girl thing yet."
[31-Jan-2015 22:24:43]  <Rig> "Right, Rin?"
[31-Jan-2015 22:25:35]  <IllFlower> I feel like there's an implicit "coughcough" on the end of that.
[31-Jan-2015 22:25:58]  <Rig> Yeah, I definitely intended that.
[31-Jan-2015 22:26:39]  <IllFlower> Spidey sense is tingling!
[31-Jan-2015 22:26:58]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005?
[31-Jan-2015 22:27:05]  <BGTB2005> "Right." As much as she hated to do so, she agreed with Kazuki
[31-Jan-2015 22:28:51]  <Rig> "We should probably leave you and Rin to talk," Kazuki says. "I'm sorry that this happened, Chiaki."
[31-Jan-2015 22:29:04]  *** WildSeraph <~Spheraph@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[31-Jan-2015 22:29:10]  <IllFlower> You've gotta stop splitting up the group, man. :p
[31-Jan-2015 22:29:18]  <Alicia> Hikari nods. "You have my wishes."
[31-Jan-2015 22:29:24]  <Rig> I don't want to split up the group so much as move on.
[31-Jan-2015 22:29:42]  <ponicalica> "Remember that there's plenty of time to become a magical girl; there's no rush."
[31-Jan-2015 22:29:42]  <Rig> I'm not sure how to incorporate what I want Kazuki to realize into the narrative at this point though.
[31-Jan-2015 22:30:01]  <Rig> So, I guess I should just bring it up and have you guys help me.
[31-Jan-2015 22:30:43]  <Rig> I basically want Kazuki to realize that Katoka is his mom, but I don't want it to be so much a sudden remembrance as a Facebook search result or something.
[31-Jan-2015 22:30:47]  <Rig> Does that make sense?
[31-Jan-2015 22:31:11]  <ponicalica> Sort of.
[31-Jan-2015 22:31:40]  <IllFlower> The characters could always look her up on the school website or something.
[31-Jan-2015 22:31:49]  <Rig> I feel like Kazuki would be way more likely to do that then to remember naturally.
[31-Jan-2015 22:31:57]  <IllFlower> Cold, man.
[31-Jan-2015 22:32:08]  <Rig> Well, that's how the other characters see Kazuki.
[31-Jan-2015 22:32:25]  <Rig> Plus I imagine that there are some weird feelings about his family.
[31-Jan-2015 22:32:33]  <ponicalica> Back at Shii's church, Kazuki pulls out his cell phone, etc.
[31-Jan-2015 22:32:46]  <Rig> Yeah, but we'd need to move to that sort of situation somehow.
[31-Jan-2015 22:32:47]  <IllFlower> Doesn't even remember his mom's maiden name. How does he verify his identity when he calls his credit card company?
[31-Jan-2015 22:32:56]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:6839:85e6:d8a1:f09f> has quit IRC (Quit: Time to go!)
[31-Jan-2015 22:33:05]  <Rig> Let's imagine that we live in a way more secure universe.
[31-Jan-2015 22:33:18]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I think it's enough to say that something's up with the class.
[31-Jan-2015 22:33:19]  <BGTB2005> he uses a different question, clearly
[31-Jan-2015 22:33:37]  <IllFlower> That ought to be sufficient motivation to poke around in that direction.
[31-Jan-2015 22:33:56]  <IllFlower> How many times do you see this many elements line up? Something's fishy.
[31-Jan-2015 22:33:58]  <Rig> Kazuki's own curiosity at the name would definitely provide his own motivation.
[31-Jan-2015 22:34:10]  <Rig> IllFlower: Well, for these characters it's a Tuesday.
[31-Jan-2015 22:34:14]  <IllFlower> Well, yeah, but he'd never say it.
[31-Jan-2015 22:34:23]  <Rig> True.
[31-Jan-2015 22:34:48]  <BGTB2005> I think it's a Sunday right now :p
[31-Jan-2015 22:34:49]  <Rig> So, how do we want to handle this transition and where are we transitioning to?
[31-Jan-2015 22:35:04]  <IllFlower> Unlikely "coincidences" day is Wednesday! Tuesday's chili party day!
[31-Jan-2015 22:35:17]  <IllFlower> Get it straight!
[31-Jan-2015 22:35:18]  <ponicalica> I assumed we'd regroup at Shii's church anyways, but maybe not?
[31-Jan-2015 22:35:34]  <Alicia> Stalk around the surrounding area lookin' for clue - or that.
[31-Jan-2015 22:35:37]  <IllFlower> Go to coffee shop. Check smartphone.
[31-Jan-2015 22:35:44]  <IllFlower> Anything works.
[31-Jan-2015 22:35:48]  <Rig> Well, that seems like an okay shot. Maybe we all meet at Shii's church to do some yearbook snooping?
[31-Jan-2015 22:35:54]  <BGTB2005> We could try and check the crime scene?
[31-Jan-2015 22:36:08]  <IllFlower> Do you want to ask Chiaki for her yearbook?
[31-Jan-2015 22:36:21]  <Rig> Are Rin and Chiaki in the same school?
[31-Jan-2015 22:36:53]  <IllFlower> I guess you could just use Rin's...
[31-Jan-2015 22:37:23]  <Rig> Kazuki texts Rin later, "Hey, could you bring your yearbook to Shii's office later tonight."
[31-Jan-2015 22:37:28]  <BGTB2005> according to my head-canon, I'd say they aren't given the age difference
[31-Jan-2015 22:37:35]  <Rig> Strike that then.
[31-Jan-2015 22:37:39]  <ponicalica> Wait, what even is the age difference again
[31-Jan-2015 22:37:54]  <ponicalica> rin's 17, chiaki's no-age-listed
[31-Jan-2015 22:38:21]  <Rig> Well, Kazuki is around Chiaki's age according to last session.
[31-Jan-2015 22:38:25]  <BGTB2005> I was running with Chiaki being like three and a half years older
[31-Jan-2015 22:38:43]  <Rig> But Kazuki is like 20/21, IIRC.
[31-Jan-2015 22:38:49]  <BGTB2005> I have this written down in a document somewhere...
[31-Jan-2015 22:38:50]  <Rig> I think that's what I said originally.
[31-Jan-2015 22:38:58]  <Rig> We've lost track, IllFlower.
[31-Jan-2015 22:39:03]  <Rig> Everything is off the rails.
[31-Jan-2015 22:39:13]  <IllFlower> She's clearly not that much older. Either that or she failed a year...
[31-Jan-2015 22:39:23]  * Alicia falls off the tracks
[31-Jan-2015 22:39:39]  <ponicalica> trainicia
[31-Jan-2015 22:39:40]  <BGTB2005> were we even on them to begin with?
[31-Jan-2015 22:39:42]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I think we can pull some levers for narrative expediency.
[31-Jan-2015 22:39:54]  <IllFlower> Are we going back to the chapel?
[31-Jan-2015 22:40:58]  <ponicalica> I was assuming that and then Kazuki can pull out his smartphone or whatever
[31-Jan-2015 22:41:33]  <IllFlower> FFWD>>
[31-Jan-2015 22:41:41]  <Rig> I think we can do that. Maybe have the group snooping into what the hell happened.
[31-Jan-2015 22:42:14]  <IllFlower> Kazuki has the website for Chiaki's school pulled up on his phone.
[31-Jan-2015 22:42:15]  *** MabelAvenue is now known as CentralAve
[31-Jan-2015 22:42:42]  <IllFlower> The group's assembled in the pews, not sure if they want Shii to know about this enough to actually do it inside her office.
[31-Jan-2015 22:43:13]  <Rig> Kazuki is sitting in one of the pews of Shii's church, flipping through the faculty for Chiaki's school on his phone. "Katoka," he mumbles as he scans for the name.
[31-Jan-2015 22:43:55]  <Rig> He finds her entry and he just stares at the picture silently for a moment. "Oh," the sound escapes him quietly.
[31-Jan-2015 22:43:57]  <IllFlower> You're missing an "a".
[31-Jan-2015 22:44:01]  <Rig> "It's my mom."
[31-Jan-2015 22:44:17]  <Rig> Sorry, just grabbed the last time I typed it.
[31-Jan-2015 22:44:20]  <Rig> Which was wrong then too.
[31-Jan-2015 22:44:58]  <ponicalica> "Your mom?"
[31-Jan-2015 22:45:01]  <ponicalica> ("Metal Gear?")
[31-Jan-2015 22:45:23]  <Rig> Kazuki's head snaps up from his phone. He didn't realize he'd spoken out loud. (A terrible habit.)
[31-Jan-2015 22:45:40]  <Rig> "Chiaki's homeroom teacher is my mother," he says flatly
[31-Jan-2015 22:45:42]  <Rig> *.
[31-Jan-2015 22:46:28]  <IllFlower> Blunt.
[31-Jan-2015 22:46:54]  <ponicalica> "She's the one that got in an argument with her or something, right?"
[31-Jan-2015 22:47:10]  <Rig> IllFlower: Not really sure how Kazuki would feel, tbh.
[31-Jan-2015 22:47:55]  <Rig> I'm thinking he'd be sorta stuck between familial pull and an idea that she ran away from his family.
[31-Jan-2015 22:48:08]  <Rig> *he and his dad.
[31-Jan-2015 22:48:14]  <ponicalica> *an argument with Chiaki
[31-Jan-2015 22:49:13]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yeah, I know.
[31-Jan-2015 22:49:22]  <Rig> "Yeah, Chiaki said they had a shouting match." Kazuki says, but his thought are still far off.
[31-Jan-2015 22:49:26]  <IllFlower> It's a conflicted kind of bluntness.
[31-Jan-2015 22:49:38]  <Rig> Yeah.
[31-Jan-2015 22:49:47]  <Rig> *his thoughts
[31-Jan-2015 22:50:20]  <Rig> I also have a challenge to make IllFlower call Kazuki's behavior cold in ever chapter of this arc.
[31-Jan-2015 22:50:34]  <Rig> Bonus XP if I accomplish it.
[31-Jan-2015 22:50:43]  <Rig> *every chapter
[31-Jan-2015 22:51:21]  <IllFlower> It doesn't count if you make Kazuki dive into a tank of ice water.
[31-Jan-2015 22:51:36]  * Rig strikes his plans for chapter 4.
[31-Jan-2015 22:51:37]  <ponicalica> Kazuki pushes Ayako into a tank of ice water.
[31-Jan-2015 22:51:44]  <ponicalica> Would that count?
[31-Jan-2015 22:51:45]  <BGTB2005> or Rin
[31-Jan-2015 22:53:56]  <IllFlower> ANYWAY LET'S GO WITH THIS CONVERSATION
[31-Jan-2015 22:54:58]  <Rig> (Kazuki continues to elaborate on Chiaki's argument with his ersatz mother.)
[31-Jan-2015 22:55:23]  <Rig> "Rin, do you know what they argued about?"
[31-Jan-2015 22:56:32]  *** Saladofstones <~What@cl198247.callutheran.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[31-Jan-2015 22:58:32]  <BGTB2005> Rin thinks for a moment. "No.  If she told me, I don't remember."
[31-Jan-2015 22:58:43]  <BGTB2005> "I could call and ask."
[31-Jan-2015 22:59:48]  <Rig> "No, you don't need to bother her."
[31-Jan-2015 23:00:27]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[31-Jan-2015 23:00:58]  <IllFlower> I like how none of the characters probed Kazuki's apparent shocked reaction.
[31-Jan-2015 23:00:59]  <Rig> I'm not sure where to go from here, sadly. Should we investigate Kazuki's mom? Do we have any other leads?
[31-Jan-2015 23:01:20]  <Rig> IllFlower: Well, we've all shown such emotional depth.
[31-Jan-2015 23:01:50]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: That's the problem with the players knowing things the characters don't, I guess
[31-Jan-2015 23:02:14]  <IllFlower> That's what roleplaying is for! :(
[31-Jan-2015 23:03:14]  <Rig> Kazuki looks back at the bad photo of his mother staring up at him from the phone screen. After a moment the screen goes black and he looks up at his team.
[31-Jan-2015 23:03:40]  <Rig> "Did anyone else find anything?" he asks, trying to ignore the looks of his teammates.
[31-Jan-2015 23:06:31]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has quit IRC (Quit: we're living on borrowed time and it looks like they want it back)
[31-Jan-2015 23:06:47]  <IllFlower> Awkward conversation go!
[31-Jan-2015 23:06:59]  <ponicalica> "Unfortunately, no.  Since your mom is involved, even if only tangentially, perhaps we should talk to her?"
[31-Jan-2015 23:07:04]  <Alicia> "No, ever since the attacks things have been rather quiet." Hikari says shaking her head.
[31-Jan-2015 23:07:58]  <Rig> Kazuki sighs, "Nothing?"
[31-Jan-2015 23:08:42]  <Rig> "I don't know why talking to my mother would help. She left... she left the Order when I was young."
[31-Jan-2015 23:11:31]  <Alicia> "Breaking off all assocations, too?"
[31-Jan-2015 23:12:07]  <Rig> Kazuki doesn't really respond to Hikari's question, but the answer is pretty obvious.
[31-Jan-2015 23:12:11]  <ponicalica> "And yet, she seems to have an interest in Chiaki, and works at a school where two initiates were killed."
[31-Jan-2015 23:12:41]  <Rig> "We don't have any lead from the familiar?"
[31-Jan-2015 23:13:09]  <BGTB2005> ...do we know who their familiar is?
[31-Jan-2015 23:13:27]  <Rig> I imagine we could figure it out.
[31-Jan-2015 23:13:38]  <BGTB2005> We could try asking Shii
[31-Jan-2015 23:14:03]  *** Section42L <~section@CPE18593345ef4c-CM18593345ef49.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[31-Jan-2015 23:14:14]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: She mentioned Myaa once
[31-Jan-2015 23:14:26]  <ponicalica> er, Chiaki did
[31-Jan-2015 23:14:30]  <Rig> But it'd be more fun to push Kazuki into a confrontation with his mom.
[31-Jan-2015 23:14:58]  <IllFlower> All separate familiars. I can tell you now they wouldn't have anything useful to say.
[31-Jan-2015 23:15:21]  <IllFlower> Though if you want to roleplay getting no useful information out of them, that's fine with me. :p
[31-Jan-2015 23:16:14]  <Rig> Or you could try to push Kazuki to confront his mom.
[31-Jan-2015 23:16:16]  <BGTB2005> I guess we could run around doing that and then have Kazuki and his mom chat for a bit
[31-Jan-2015 23:16:36]  <ponicalica> "Their familiars are just as confused as we are.  I also urged Myaa for patience with Chiaki, but I'm not sure if he listened."
[31-Jan-2015 23:17:17]  <Rig> "There has to be another lead. She left. She quit the Order and magic and everything associated with it."
[31-Jan-2015 23:18:23]  <Rig> IllFlower: Would you mind if we did this in a slightly different way?
[31-Jan-2015 23:18:31]  <IllFlower> What way?
[31-Jan-2015 23:18:40]  <Rig> Could we do this at a conflict maybe?
[31-Jan-2015 23:18:54]  <Rig> *as a
[31-Jan-2015 23:19:23]  <IllFlower> I don't mind. Stakes?
[31-Jan-2015 23:19:39]  <Rig> Kazuki wins: we interview familiars first.
[31-Jan-2015 23:19:53]  <Rig> Other people win: we go to his mom.
[31-Jan-2015 23:20:29]  <IllFlower> I'm down with it.
[31-Jan-2015 23:21:07]  <IllFlower> I was hoping we could get to some juicy stuff.
[31-Jan-2015 23:21:25]  <ponicalica> Yeah, I like that too.
[31-Jan-2015 23:21:41]  <Rig> I just feel like Kazuki wouldn't just be like "Yeah, let's go see my mom, whom I have issues with."
[31-Jan-2015 23:21:54]  <Rig> He definitely needs some kind of force applied to him.
[31-Jan-2015 23:21:55]  <IllFlower> Of course.
[31-Jan-2015 23:22:02]  <IllFlower> So let's apply some force!

[31-Jan-2015 23:24:50]  <Rig> IllFlower: You okay with me starting?
[31-Jan-2015 23:24:58]  <IllFlower> Go right ahead.
[31-Jan-2015 23:25:09]  <BGTB2005> I guess Kazuki would get an additional d8 since his opponents are conservators?
[31-Jan-2015 23:25:35]  <ponicalica> I think it's usually only if his standing in the Conservators is at stake
[31-Jan-2015 23:26:30]  <Rig> Kazuki looks around at his team, "Are you really telling me that the most convince lead we can find about a murder is that my estranged mother might have argued with a classmate?" Kazuki looks right at Ayako, "I was almost certain you were smarter than that."

[31-Jan-2015 23:27:12]  <Rig> I dunno if everyone needs to respond to that with a see or just Ayako.
[31-Jan-2015 23:27:14]  <ponicalica> can I put in the elements dice for that burn?
[31-Jan-2015 23:27:38]  <BGTB2005> pffff
[31-Jan-2015 23:28:29]  <ponicalica> more seriously, now to decide on a response
[31-Jan-2015 23:28:40]  <IllFlower> Rig: Well, that's your decision.
[31-Jan-2015 23:28:50]  <Rig> I definitely think it was pointed toward Ayako.
[31-Jan-2015 23:31:09]  <IllFlower> Then it's just Ayako's see.
[31-Jan-2015 23:31:24]  <Rig> Need any help dealing with that sick burn?
[31-Jan-2015 23:31:33]  <ponicalica> a little, yeah
[31-Jan-2015 23:31:49]  <Rig> @dice show ponicalica
[31-Jan-2015 23:31:49]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Bank has 3 4 4 4 5 5 6 6 6 = 43.
[31-Jan-2015 23:32:12]  <ponicalica> I mean, dice-wise, no, but having trouble decinig on a response, yes
[31-Jan-2015 23:32:24]  <Rig> I just wanted to see dice to know what the options were.
[31-Jan-2015 23:32:25]  <BGTB2005> witchbrain :p
[31-Jan-2015 23:32:44]  <ponicalica> pull out demonic influence, go even more overkill on 'em
[31-Jan-2015 23:32:45]  <Rig> You could snap back with something about how the most fruitful lead is clearly his mom.
[31-Jan-2015 23:32:57]  <Rig> And then raise with something about his issues.
[31-Jan-2015 23:33:04]  <Rig> Or with a your mom joke.
[31-Jan-2015 23:33:11]  <Rig> Always an option here.
[31-Jan-2015 23:33:18]  <Rig> This conflict is rife with your mom jokes.
[31-Jan-2015 23:33:19]  <BGTB2005> yeah Kazuki's mom seems to be pretty much the only really common element here
[31-Jan-2015 23:33:41]  <Rig> IllFlower has written an arc where we end up in a epic battle of "Your mom" jokes as the climax.
[31-Jan-2015 23:34:06]  <IllFlower> Or Fountains of Wayne songs.
[31-Jan-2015 23:34:18]  <ponicalica> "Two initiates die shortly after a former member of the Order suddenly gets really interested in a potential member, and this somehow *isn't* suspicious to you?"
[31-Jan-2015 23:35:09]  <ponicalica> @dice use 3 5
[31-Jan-2015 23:35:09]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Used 3 5 = 8. Bank now has 4 4 4 5 6 6 6 = 35.
[31-Jan-2015 23:35:17]  <ponicalica> (see)
[31-Jan-2015 23:37:29]  <ponicalica> "I understand you might have issues talking to family but we can't let this get in the way of figuring out what's going on!"
[31-Jan-2015 23:37:45]  <Alicia> How forward of her.
[31-Jan-2015 23:38:45]  <IllFlower> Dice?
[31-Jan-2015 23:38:46]  <ponicalica> @dice use 4 4 >! raise
[31-Jan-2015 23:38:46]  <Omnipresence> 14: Used 4 4 = 8. Bank now has 4 5 6 6 6 = 27.
[31-Jan-2015 23:39:00]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: I wasn't 100% sure that was a solid raise, sorry
[31-Jan-2015 23:39:20]  <IllFlower> It's an argument, real arguments never have solidity.
[31-Jan-2015 23:39:22]  <Rig> @dice show
[31-Jan-2015 23:39:22]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Bank has 1 1 1 4 4 5 5 6 = 27.
[31-Jan-2015 23:40:18]  <Rig> "It's not an issue!" Kazuki's voice raises before he catches himself and sits back in the pew. "I just think it's circumstantial at best." 
[31-Jan-2015 23:40:25]  <Rig> @dice use 1 1 6
[31-Jan-2015 23:40:25]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Used 1 1 6 = 8. Bank now has 1 4 4 5 5 = 19.
[31-Jan-2015 23:40:31]  <Rig> 2d4 fallout, I think.
[31-Jan-2015 23:40:34]  <IllFlower> 3d4.
[31-Jan-2015 23:40:36]  <ponicalica> 3d4
[31-Jan-2015 23:40:37]  <Rig> 3d4, yeah.
[31-Jan-2015 23:41:26]  <Rig> Rin or Hikari raise next. I think Rin if we go by dice.
[31-Jan-2015 23:42:07]  <ponicalica> @dice show BGTB2005 
[31-Jan-2015 23:42:07]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Bank has 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 4 6 6 = 31.
[31-Jan-2015 23:42:09]  <BGTB2005> I can't think of anything to say right now; Alicia can go
[31-Jan-2015 23:42:12]  <ponicalica> @dice show Alicia
[31-Jan-2015 23:42:12]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Bank has 1 1 2 2 3 5 5 6 = 25.
[31-Jan-2015 23:42:23]  <Alicia> @dice show BGTB2005 
[31-Jan-2015 23:42:23]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Bank has 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 4 6 6 = 31.
[31-Jan-2015 23:42:56]  <Rig> Really, just yelling at Kazuki that he's wrong would be appropriate.
[31-Jan-2015 23:43:07]  <Rig> Kazuki has like, no backing here. That's why I took the blow there.
[31-Jan-2015 23:43:17]  <Alicia> I can yell.
[31-Jan-2015 23:45:02]  <IllFlower> Hikari has so many traits that could totally crush Kazuki's spirits right now.
[31-Jan-2015 23:45:59]  <Alicia> Hikari sighs, before staring Kazuki down. "Oh, come off it! You are raising your voice, for crying out loud." She takes a step back. "'Circumstantial' or not, you're a Conservator, so do your job with us and look into it."
[31-Jan-2015 23:46:03]  <Alicia> @dice use 5 5
[31-Jan-2015 23:46:03]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Used 5 5 = 10. Bank now has 1 1 2 2 3 6 = 15.
[31-Jan-2015 23:46:09]  <Alicia> (Uh, raise? See?)
[31-Jan-2015 23:46:17]  <Rig> @dice show
[31-Jan-2015 23:46:17]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Bank has 1 4 4 5 5 = 19.
[31-Jan-2015 23:46:21]  <ponicalica> it's your turn for a raise so
[31-Jan-2015 23:46:28]  <Alicia> Mmm.
[31-Jan-2015 23:46:40]  <Rig> Kazuki glares at Hikari for a moment.
[31-Jan-2015 23:47:17]  <Rig> "You...." Kazuki begins, before halting. "Fine, we can go see her. She's probably the only lead we've got."
[31-Jan-2015 23:47:30]  <Rig> "Not that we're on the case," he mumbles.
[31-Jan-2015 23:47:36]  <Rig> Kazuki gives, of course.
[31-Jan-2015 23:47:57]  <IllFlower> lol
[31-Jan-2015 23:48:06]  <IllFlower> But you had all those dice!
[31-Jan-2015 23:48:13]  <Alicia> Hikari turns away slightly. "I... didn't mean to raise my voice at you, per se; but Ayako has a point, and I feel she's worth listening to here."
[31-Jan-2015 23:48:24]  <Rig> Sure, but I just wanted to cause some conflict before we wrapped it up. And Hikari has a point.
[31-Jan-2015 23:48:42]  <Rig> Plus let's play more with the idea that Kazuki and Hikari get along and can handle each other.
[31-Jan-2015 23:48:45]  <Alicia> Of course she does. She's Hikari.
[31-Jan-2015 23:49:09]  <Alicia> Rig: Cooperation..... in ..... EmDogs.. !!/12
[31-Jan-2015 23:49:09]  <Rig> "Yeah, I'm just..." Kazuki sighs. "It's my mom."
[31-Jan-2015 23:49:15]  <Alicia> ?*
[31-Jan-2015 23:49:56]  <Rig> @dice roll 3d4
[31-Jan-2015 23:49:56]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Rolled 1 2 4 = 7.
[31-Jan-2015 23:50:55]  <Rig> I'm gonna mark down Kazuki's Ac by one for the next conflict as short term.
[31-Jan-2015 23:51:36]  <IllFlower> Okay.
[31-Jan-2015 23:51:54]  <IllFlower> Do the other Conservators know what's up with Kazuki's mom?
[31-Jan-2015 23:52:01]  <Alicia> (By the way, were you going to say something after that? I couldn't tell, Rig.)
[31-Jan-2015 23:52:06]  <ponicalica> We know she left the Order and cut off all ties, I think
[31-Jan-2015 23:52:12]  <Rig> No, that was kinda a stopping point.
[31-Jan-2015 23:52:21]  <Rig> You can ask questions and such freely.
[31-Jan-2015 23:53:41]  <Rig> I've got maybe 15 minutes before I need to go though.
[31-Jan-2015 23:53:45]  <ponicalica> "Beyond leaving the Order, is there anything else we should know about your mom?"
[31-Jan-2015 23:53:56]  <Alicia> "Well... that's understandable, as you two have some issues." Hikari says as she sits back down. "Might I ask, though, why you're so intent on not being around her?"
[31-Jan-2015 23:54:30]  <Rig> "She left the Order, and my family, when I was kinda young." Kazuki says, hesitant and quiet.
[31-Jan-2015 23:55:24]  <Rig> "I don't remember why she left. I think she didn't really want me to make a contract."
[31-Jan-2015 23:55:39]  <Rig> "If she knew I was a Conservator..."
[31-Jan-2015 23:55:53]  <Rig> Kazuki trails off.
[31-Jan-2015 23:57:19]  <IllFlower> Kazuki being emotional? Be still, my heart.
[31-Jan-2015 23:57:35]  <Rig> It's all IllFlower wanted in his New Year's Wish.
[31-Jan-2015 23:57:49]  <IllFlower> lol
[31-Jan-2015 23:58:39]  <Rig> "We can go talk to her, but you guys will have to lead."
[31-Jan-2015 23:59:01]  <Alicia> Hikari furrows her brows a little. "I'm sorry she left you." She nods. "That's fine by me, Kazuki."
[31-Jan-2015 23:59:41]  <Rig> Kazuki shrugs at the apology.
[01-Feb-2015 00:01:31]  <IllFlower> Anyone have anything else to add?
[01-Feb-2015 00:01:55]  <ponicalica> not that I can think of
[01-Feb-2015 00:02:44]  <BGTB2005> I got nothing
[01-Feb-2015 00:03:03]  <Alicia> Hrm, no, sorry.
[01-Feb-2015 00:04:15]  <IllFlower> All right, then we can wrap up for today. We'll pick up next time.
[01-Feb-2015 00:04:19]  <IllFlower> Thanks again, everyone.
[01-Feb-2015 00:04:24]  <Rig> Thanks for the session.
[01-Feb-2015 00:04:26]  <Rig> It was fun.
