@time=2015-01-31T20:12:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Last time, we left off with the group trying to talk Chiaki through what being an initiate is like.
@time=2015-01-31T20:12:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anything left to pick up with there?
@time=2015-01-31T20:14:22.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Don't see anything super pressing.
@time=2015-01-31T20:14:42.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I... don't think so.
@time=2015-01-31T20:14:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, then on we march.
@time=2015-01-31T20:16:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :After thanking the Conservators for their help, Chiaki goes home with Rin.
@time=2015-01-31T20:16:19.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :^_~
@time=2015-01-31T20:16:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The next morning is a Sunday, but any plans to sleep in that anyone may have had are wrecked by a seven o'clock summons from Shii.
@time=2015-01-31T20:19:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A tense silence pervades the room as she waits for everyone to arrive.
@time=2015-01-31T20:19:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The familiar doesn't even verbally greet her initiates when they walk in, merely glancing at them and nodding.
@time=2015-01-31T20:20:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari is the last to enter. After about thirty quiet seconds, Shii finally speaks.
@time=2015-01-31T20:21:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"There's no good way to deliver this news. Two initiates were killed overnight."
@time=2015-01-31T20:21:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :This swung rapidly.

@time=2015-01-31T20:21:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari lets out a short gasp. "How... what happened?"
@time=2015-01-31T20:25:39.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Do we have any ideas on a culprit?"
@time=2015-01-31T20:25:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"They were found dead on a residential street in Kumagawa ward. A Conservator patrolling the area saw signs of a battle and rushed to the scene - too late, unfortunately.
@time=2015-01-31T20:26:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The victims show obvious signs of being killed in an ambush. I won't get into the particular details of the condition they were found in, but suffice it to say it was very deliberate and very unpleasant.
@time=2015-01-31T20:27:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"There aren't any leads on a suspect. Whoever was responsible knew how to avoid leaving evidence."
@time=2015-01-31T20:28:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin's heart skips at the mention of Kumagawa. She lives there, after all.
@time=2015-01-31T20:30:56.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Do... do we know who the victims are?"
@time=2015-01-31T20:31:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii continues. "The two initiates' names were Takumi Oonishi and Hiroko Shimamura. Both eighteen years of age, and both, unfortunately enough, initiates for less than ten days when they were killed."
@time=2015-01-31T20:32:03.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :no twinge of recognition here, right?
@time=2015-01-31T20:32:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :No.
@time=2015-01-31T20:32:23.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Are we being assigned to investigate this one?"
@time=2015-01-31T20:34:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Not formally. At least not yet. My superiors are in some disarray.
@time=2015-01-31T20:34:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"They're a bit shocked at how new the victims were. Understandably."
@time=2015-01-31T20:36:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii pauses for a second, then continues, "I'll let you know if and when the time comes."

@time=2015-01-31T20:37:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The color seems to have drained from Shii's fluffy face, which was already pretty white to begin with.
@time=2015-01-31T20:37:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I assume Kumagawa isn't far from any of us?
@time=2015-01-31T20:37:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin lives there, so it's within commuting distance.
@time=2015-01-31T20:37:39.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin lives there, apparently
@time=2015-01-31T20:38:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki looks over at Rin.

@time=2015-01-31T20:39:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Try tsundere.
@time=2015-01-31T20:39:32.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("It's not like I care, but are you okay?")

@time=2015-01-31T20:40:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's just bureaucratic.
@time=2015-01-31T20:40:23.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Rin, your friend was thinking about becoming an initiate, right?"
@time=2015-01-31T20:41:25.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The one who came in yesterday?"
@time=2015-01-31T20:41:28.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Maybe it's a good idea if she turns it down."
@time=2015-01-31T20:41:45.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah..."
@time=2015-01-31T20:42:21.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It wouldn't be a good idea to put her in any unnecessary danger, Rin."
@time=2015-01-31T20:43:59.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"At least until we figure out who's behind these murders."
@time=2015-01-31T20:44:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What's this about?" Shii asks.
@time=2015-01-31T20:45:40.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki remembers his doubts about talking to Rin's friend about this at all.
@time=2015-01-31T20:45:48.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He briefly wonders if they'll be in trouble.
@time=2015-01-31T20:46:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But considering murders, there are bigger fish.
@time=2015-01-31T20:46:57.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yesterday Rin brought in one of her friends, who had been asked if she wanted to become an initiate... so we shared some details with her."

@time=2015-01-31T20:47:25.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari pauses. "She didn't quite take to it, it seemed like."
@time=2015-01-31T20:49:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii nods. "It'd be for the best if she held back for now.
@time=2015-01-31T20:50:06.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :of course, for maximum irony points, she probably just contracted
@time=2015-01-31T20:50:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Does Rin's friend live in that area as well? This doesn't feel right."
@time=2015-01-31T20:52:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(She does, of course.)
@time=2015-01-31T20:52:37.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I would assume," Kazuki says, looking to Rin for confirmation.
@time=2015-01-31T20:53:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Should we check up on her?"
@time=2015-01-31T20:53:57.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She moved there not too long ago..."
@time=2015-01-31T20:54:00.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Probably, if Rin doesn't think this'll spook her too much"
@time=2015-01-31T20:54:18.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Probably shouldn't mention the murders..."
@time=2015-01-31T20:55:07.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"If we could get in contact with her potential familiar as well, that might also be worthwhile."
@time=2015-01-31T20:55:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :At this exact moment, Rin's phone rings. Guess who!
@time=2015-01-31T20:55:56.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin's mom?
@time=2015-01-31T20:56:01.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :definitely one of her old bullies
@time=2015-01-31T20:56:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Totally Shii.
@time=2015-01-31T20:56:06.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :is it chiaki
@time=2015-01-31T20:56:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii is calling Rin from inside the house.
@time=2015-01-31T20:57:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Rin, you have to help me out here!"
@time=2015-01-31T20:57:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Chiaki's voice is positively trying to claw its way out of the phone in desperation.
@time=2015-01-31T20:57:42.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin checks and answers
@time=2015-01-31T20:57:46.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hello?"
@time=2015-01-31T20:57:56.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Chiaki uses her newfound powers to escape out of the other side of the phone
@time=2015-01-31T20:59:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I-- I-- Rin, the school called this morning to tell me that two of my classmates died and--"
@time=2015-01-31T21:00:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Her voice is loud enough that Rin has to hold the phone away from her ear in order to make anything out that's not a lump of distorted noise.
@time=2015-01-31T21:03:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki is caught between being amused at this situation and genuinely concerned.
@time=2015-01-31T21:03:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You're a terrible person, Kazuki.
@time=2015-01-31T21:03:42.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's too cliche to not laugh.
@time=2015-01-31T21:04:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just don't laugh too loudly.
@time=2015-01-31T21:04:58.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How mean.
@time=2015-01-31T21:05:13.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just because Kazuki has high Ht doesn't mean he's not a mean person.
@time=2015-01-31T21:05:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :True~
@time=2015-01-31T21:05:58.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin glances at the others, unsure of how to respond and wondering if they overheard anything
@time=2015-01-31T21:06:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Rin?" he decides to venture.
@time=2015-01-31T21:11:15.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Is your friend okay?"
@time=2015-01-31T21:12:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Is *Rin* okay?
@time=2015-01-31T21:12:19.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :is Rin ever okay?
@time=2015-01-31T21:13:09.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I... I don't know," Rin answers Kazuki
@time=2015-01-31T21:14:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So what's the plan?
@time=2015-01-31T21:14:48.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :i dunno
@time=2015-01-31T21:14:53.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :visit Chiaki?
@time=2015-01-31T21:14:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd say go see what's up.
@time=2015-01-31T21:15:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Visiting her sounds like a good idea.
@time=2015-01-31T21:15:14.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Though explaining why we all visited her should be fun.
@time=2015-01-31T21:15:18.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We were so worried!"
@time=2015-01-31T21:15:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Why?"
@time=2015-01-31T21:15:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Oh, the murders."
@time=2015-01-31T21:15:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Snicker.
@time=2015-01-31T21:15:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm pretty sure you guys can explain this.
@time=2015-01-31T21:15:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, I hope.
@time=2015-01-31T21:16:10.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :well, we want to avoid freaking her out too much, but that ship may have already sailed
@time=2015-01-31T21:16:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin finally manages to calm Chiaki down for long enough to say that she's on her way there.
@time=2015-01-31T21:17:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She tries to mention that the others might be joining her, but she's not sure if that part get through.
@time=2015-01-31T21:19:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Chiaki's house is about fifteen minutes' walk from the nearest train station, in a hilly part of town. It looks like a pretty typical Sunday morning scene: dogs on walks, people on jogs, the occasional friendly old person.
@time=2015-01-31T21:19:52.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :that's code for "it didn't get through" isn't it :p

@time=2015-01-31T21:20:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's all a bit familiarly dissonant. Maybe more than a bit.

@time=2015-01-31T21:34:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Chiaki's response to Rin's knock at her bedroom door is a simple, listless "It's open."
@time=2015-01-31T21:35:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She's sitting on top of a messy futon, staring through the window.
@time=2015-01-31T21:38:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I hope the Conservators aren't just going to stand in the doorway staring at her.

@time=2015-01-31T21:41:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Chiaki smiles and returns the hug. The skin around her eyes is a bit red, Rin notices.

@time=2015-01-31T23:47:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :lol
@time=2015-01-31T23:48:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But you had all those dice!
@time=2015-01-31T23:48:13.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari turns away slightly. "I... didn't mean to raise my voice at you, per se; but Ayako has a point, and I feel she's worth listening to here."
@time=2015-01-31T23:48:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sure, but I just wanted to cause some conflict before we wrapped it up. And Hikari has a point.
@time=2015-01-31T23:48:42.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Plus let's play more with the idea that Kazuki and Hikari get along and can handle each other.
@time=2015-01-31T23:48:45.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Of course she does. She's Hikari.
@time=2015-01-31T23:49:09.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: Cooperation..... in ..... EmDogs.. !!/12
@time=2015-01-31T23:49:09.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah, I'm just..." Kazuki sighs. "It's my mom."
@time=2015-01-31T23:49:15.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :?*
@time=2015-01-31T23:49:56.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :@dice roll 3d4
@time=2015-01-31T23:49:56.000Z :Omnipresence PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14Rig: Rolled 1 2 4 = 7.
@time=2015-01-31T23:50:55.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm gonna mark down Kazuki's Ac by one for the next conflict as short term.
@time=2015-01-31T23:51:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay.
@time=2015-01-31T23:51:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Do the other Conservators know what's up with Kazuki's mom?
@time=2015-01-31T23:52:01.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(By the way, were you going to say something after that? I couldn't tell, Rig.)
@time=2015-01-31T23:52:06.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We know she left the Order and cut off all ties, I think
@time=2015-01-31T23:52:12.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :No, that was kinda a stopping point.
@time=2015-01-31T23:52:21.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You can ask questions and such freely.
@time=2015-01-31T23:53:41.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I've got maybe 15 minutes before I need to go though.
@time=2015-01-31T23:53:45.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Beyond leaving the Order, is there anything else we should know about your mom?"
@time=2015-01-31T23:53:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well... that's understandable, as you two have some issues." Hikari says as she sits back down. "Might I ask, though, why you're so intent on not being around her?"
@time=2015-01-31T23:54:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She left the Order, and my family, when I was kinda young." Kazuki says, hesitant and quiet.
@time=2015-01-31T23:55:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I don't remember why she left. I think she didn't really want me to make a contract."
@time=2015-01-31T23:55:39.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"If she knew I was a Conservator..."
@time=2015-01-31T23:55:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki trails off.
@time=2015-01-31T23:57:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki being emotional? Be still, my heart.
@time=2015-01-31T23:57:35.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's all IllFlower wanted in his New Year's Wish.
@time=2015-01-31T23:57:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :lol
@time=2015-01-31T23:58:39.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We can go talk to her, but you guys will have to lead."
@time=2015-01-31T23:59:01.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari furrows her brows a little. "I'm sorry she left you." She nods. "That's fine by me, Kazuki."
@time=2015-01-31T23:59:41.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki shrugs at the apology.
@time=2015-02-01T00:01:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyone have anything else to add?
@time=2015-02-01T00:01:55.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :not that I can think of
@time=2015-02-01T00:02:44.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I got nothing
@time=2015-02-01T00:03:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hrm, no, sorry.
@time=2015-02-01T00:04:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, then we can wrap up for today. We'll pick up next time.
@time=2015-02-01T00:04:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks again, everyone.
@time=2015-02-01T00:04:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for the session.
@time=2015-02-01T00:04:26.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It was fun.
