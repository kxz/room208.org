@time=2014-11-22T22:39:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Then I'll do that, I guess.

@time=2014-11-22T22:43:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yep.
@time=2014-11-22T22:44:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You could d4 the relationship with Miho.
@time=2014-11-22T22:45:32.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was just thinking of that, actually. It'd be the thing most strongly affected.

@time=2014-11-22T22:47:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Don't mind if I do," Miho says coldly, sweeping back into Asacchi's apartment.
@time=2014-11-22T22:48:28.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari forcefully shuts the door behind her, choosing to stay away from Miho and Karasuma.

@time=2014-11-22T22:52:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Miho retakes her seat at the table, ignoring the stares of the others.

@time=2014-11-22T22:57:52.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Very
@time=2014-11-22T22:58:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Miho scoffs.
@time=2014-11-22T22:58:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I assume you mean 'trusting that he'll be taken care of.'"
@time=2014-11-22T23:02:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki can't tell if she means "taken care of" in the mob hit squad way or in the "was punished already" way.
@time=2014-11-22T23:02:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Karasuma, who the other Conservators have managed to sit back down for now, fires back.

@time=2014-11-22T23:04:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Exactly what it sounds like," Miho answers.
@time=2014-11-22T23:05:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki sighs. Threats again. He could have sworn the Order had no published manual on how to threaten people.

@time=2014-11-22T23:06:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Perhaps we should split this group up." Kazuki suggests.
@time=2014-11-22T23:06:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What is the typical size of a group of initiates?
@time=2014-11-22T23:07:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There isn't one, really.
@time=2014-11-22T23:08:02.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Asacchi, would you be opposed to having a lighter load of initiates?"
@time=2014-11-22T23:09:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"No, not particularly," the familiar says.
@time=2014-11-22T23:11:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki looks at Miho and Karasuma who are still glaring at each other.
@time=2014-11-22T23:12:55.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Would you be satisfied being further way from Karasuma, Miho?"
@time=2014-11-22T23:13:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I hope you're not asking *me* to move."
@time=2014-11-22T23:13:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Huh, the group really wants to make Miho angry.)
@time=2014-11-22T23:14:47.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We'll figure out movement later, right now I just want to know if that would solve some of these problems."
@time=2014-11-22T23:15:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Before Miho can say anything, Karasuma interrupts.

@time=2014-11-22T23:17:02.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :does that make this the second arc where the Conservators' failures are made up for by initiate transfers?

@time=2014-11-23T00:00:19.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki looks at his team, "Any objections or other ideas?"

@time=2014-11-23T00:02:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari shakes her head, stepping ahead. "No. Let's go. The Order will be able to handle this."

@time=2014-11-23T00:07:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Phew.
@time=2014-11-23T00:07:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That was significantly different from our previous arcs.
@time=2014-11-23T00:07:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We've got reflection fallout for you on page 121 of the manual.
@time=2014-11-23T00:07:36.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I should actually get going, really.  I have grading I need to do.
@time=2014-11-23T00:08:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, we'll catch up on your changes later.
@time=2014-11-23T00:08:34.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm just a bit too tired, but I'll be thinking on this. >_>;
@time=2014-11-23T00:08:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: I guess it was something of an unintentional success, then.
@time=2014-11-23T00:08:55.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, it was slower, but I'm not sure that's a bad thing.
@time=2014-11-23T00:09:02.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We at least haven't killed anyone.
@time=2014-11-23T00:09:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd like to boost one of my stats.
@time=2014-11-23T00:09:30.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yay.
@time=2014-11-23T00:09:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The arc was originally a lot less subtle, as I've mentioned.
@time=2014-11-23T00:10:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's always fun to make the players take a good, hard look at the situation, though.
@time=2014-11-23T00:10:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: Which?
@time=2014-11-23T00:10:29.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd like Ac, but I'm not sure it's justified.
@time=2014-11-23T00:13:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I have to go. Sorry.
@time=2014-11-23T00:14:01.000Z :Rig QUIT
@time=2014-11-23T00:14:39.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm not sure what to do
@time=2014-11-23T00:16:46.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I kind of want to raise Ht, what with her aiming for talking things out and seeking peaceful resoultions... though she wasn't very good, and lost her cool. Hrm.
@time=2014-11-23T00:19:13.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I kinda want to add a new d6 relationship with Karasuma, but I'm not too sure how I'd go about justifying it
@time=2014-11-23T00:19:21.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There's also possibly adding a Relationship die with Kazuki, since they tries to work together and all.
@time=2014-11-23T00:22:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hm. Why don't we put this on ice for a bit and revisit it with fresh minds next time?
@time=2014-11-23T00:23:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that's a good idea. I'm tired today...
@time=2014-11-23T00:23:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for playing, everyone. We'll be back soon.
