@time=2014-08-03T20:28:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm ready to jump straight into conflict. What say you all?

@time=2014-08-03T20:29:10.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :sure let's go with that
@time=2014-08-03T20:29:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The roof is terraced and Kazuki sees Yuuya running past outside.
@time=2014-08-03T20:29:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or that, I guess.

@time=2014-08-03T20:30:19.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What are the stakes?
@time=2014-08-03T20:30:36.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :stopping Yuuya's escape?
@time=2014-08-03T20:30:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, Rin went chasing after him. Presumably she wants to catch him.
@time=2014-08-03T20:31:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So she can mash his face in, but she can do that later.
@time=2014-08-03T20:31:01.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :or as Rin initially interpreted, stopping him from throwing himself off the roof

@time=2014-08-03T20:32:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So the stakes are getting Yuuya into custody, I'd say.

@time=2014-08-04T01:28:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, gonna go get some stuff to drink.
@time=2014-08-04T01:28:13.000Z :Rig QUIT :Quit: Rig
@time=2014-08-04T01:28:25.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :...I couldn't tell if Rig was actually pissed there. >_<
@time=2014-08-04T01:28:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Vodka, it kills the pain."
@time=2014-08-04T01:28:29.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"God, my friends."
@time=2014-08-04T01:28:33.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Me too...
@time=2014-08-04T01:28:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He's not actually pissed.
@time=2014-08-04T01:29:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just very fervent.
@time=2014-08-04T01:29:11.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It was honestly unintentional, and meant to force a give like I mentioned. I just didn't think that, y'know, you're raising pretty high level dice that could go some way other than how you plan.
@time=2014-08-04T01:29:17.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Which is duh.
@time=2014-08-04T01:29:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :If he were pissed he'd just ragequit instead of giving advice.
@time=2014-08-04T01:29:44.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :For what it's worth, I actually kind of realized after I raised those dice that I probably shouldn't've been that powerful about it.
@time=2014-08-04T01:29:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig will read this later and tell me I was very very wrong.
@time=2014-08-04T01:30:24.000Z :SF_Sorrow QUIT :Ping timeout: 202 seconds
@time=2014-08-04T01:30:44.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, once I realized it was too late.
@time=2014-08-04T01:30:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, I'm thinking I'll set aside the beginning of next session for some in-character reaction time.
@time=2014-08-04T01:30:51.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but yeah, I think I'll put that under "got carried away with the magic"
@time=2014-08-04T01:30:54.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari is not a good Conservator.
@time=2014-08-04T01:31:05.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: I'm especially lookng forward to that.
@time=2014-08-04T01:31:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Until then, thanks for playing, everyone. We'll meet again on Saturday.
