[16-May-2014 22:04:45]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's get the ball rolling.
[16-May-2014 22:05:07]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: ponicalica remodels the White House | UPCOMING: UA (Nitya), Cybersix (Barcode) | http://www.redono.org/dogs/
[16-May-2014 22:05:16]  <ponicalica> wait, what
[16-May-2014 22:05:29]  <Barcode> i retreat to my coffin
[16-May-2014 22:05:30]  *** Barcode <~Barcode@dhcp-c8-d7-19-26-33-7c.cpe.sourcecable.net> has left #madokamadness
[16-May-2014 22:05:41]  <Alicia> I'm not drunk or drunklike.
[16-May-2014 22:05:45]  <Alicia> I don't even absinthe.
[16-May-2014 22:05:47]  <IllFlower> Last we left off, Michi had just prised Rin off of her roommate, Tsubaki.
[16-May-2014 22:06:01]  <ponicalica> for a second I read "Rin" as "Rig" and was very confused :V
[16-May-2014 22:06:45]  <IllFlower> Ayako and Hikari have found themselves in the awkward position of trying to investigate Michi while simultaneously distancing themselves from Rin's actions.
[16-May-2014 22:07:05]  <BGTB2005> good job Rin
[16-May-2014 22:07:33]  <IllFlower> I don't think we agreed on what's getting done here. I could see Ayako and Hikari trying to butter up Michi while they're at the hospital.
[16-May-2014 22:07:55]  <IllFlower> Or, failing that, we can smash cut to the girls returning to report to Shii.
[16-May-2014 22:08:09]  <IllFlower> Your call.
[16-May-2014 22:08:14]  <ponicalica> Alicia: what do you think
[16-May-2014 22:08:28]  <Alicia> I think maybe Rin needs to, I dunno, wait in the lounge while Ayako and Hikari chat with Michi.
[16-May-2014 22:08:36]  <Alicia> ("Grab us some tea will you, please?")
[16-May-2014 22:08:43]  <IllFlower> Or, like, not be anywhere near the proceedings.
[16-May-2014 22:08:46]  <Alicia> Basically.
[16-May-2014 22:09:04]  <IllFlower> You sure you want to put Rin in charge of hot beverages?
[16-May-2014 22:09:23]  <IllFlower> "Oops, my hand slipped. I hope you didn't get severe burns from my excessively hot tea."
[16-May-2014 22:09:51]  <Alicia> Good point.
[16-May-2014 22:10:19]  <Alicia> ponicalica: How are you with that.
[16-May-2014 22:10:32]  <ponicalica> I'm okay with that.
[16-May-2014 22:10:49]  <Alicia> Though with different stuff. Maybe just some cold tea.
[16-May-2014 22:11:05]  <BGTB2005> yeah, maybe sending Rin off to go buy some tea and cookies
[16-May-2014 22:11:09]  <IllFlower> All right, then. Action!
[16-May-2014 22:11:47]  <ponicalica> is cold tea even a thing in Japan
[16-May-2014 22:12:34]  <BGTB2005> vaguely remember having some several years ago
[16-May-2014 22:12:59]  <IllFlower> Yes, it is. You can get it quite conveniently out of vending machines.
[16-May-2014 22:13:12]  <Alicia> It's pretty good.
[16-May-2014 22:13:17]  <IllFlower> Anyway, *waves hands to indicate the cameras are rolling*
[16-May-2014 22:13:22]  <Alicia> Heh.
[16-May-2014 22:13:35]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: So we're in the hospital waiting room or something with Michi?
[16-May-2014 22:14:34]  <IllFlower> Well, presumably first the other two try to handle Rin.
[16-May-2014 22:14:56]  <IllFlower> Then once she's accounted for, they can talk to Michi.
[16-May-2014 22:17:27]  <Alicia> Hikari peeks into where Michi is with Tsubaki, before returning to Rin and Ayako. "Rin, if I may, I'd rather you let Ayako and I handle the girls in there. Still, just... what caused the outburst? What did she do that was so bad?"
[16-May-2014 22:17:56]  <IllFlower> Feel free to improvise the answer to that question.
[16-May-2014 22:18:13]  <IllFlower> Don't need to run it by me or anything.
[16-May-2014 22:18:20]  <BGTB2005> I believe Rin's participation in the last session ended with her leaving via the stairs
[16-May-2014 22:18:32]  <Alicia> (Also, visualize Hikari sighing right there. Forgot.)
[16-May-2014 22:18:43]  <Alicia> BGTB2005: I think we've moved onto the hospital now, in between scenes.
[16-May-2014 22:18:49]  <BGTB2005> ah
[16-May-2014 22:22:12]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005?
[16-May-2014 22:22:44]  <BGTB2005> still here
[16-May-2014 22:22:55]  <ponicalica> I believe that Hikari asked Rin a question.
[16-May-2014 22:22:59]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[16-May-2014 22:23:08]  <Alicia> Don't worry about improvisations and such.
[16-May-2014 22:23:31]  <ponicalica> Rin's probably too pissed off even thinking about it to be eloquent anyways
[16-May-2014 22:25:31]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[16-May-2014 22:26:22]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005?
[16-May-2014 22:26:42]  * IllFlower continues waving hands
[16-May-2014 22:27:12]  <ponicalica> Maybe we should just suppose Rin says something.  I was never sure how to explain Sumire's bullying either.
[16-May-2014 22:28:18]  <BGTB2005> "She and her friends..." Rin clenches her fists as she tries to stay calm
[16-May-2014 22:28:42]  <BGTB2005> "Just ask Ayako"
[16-May-2014 22:29:06]  <IllFlower> Hahahaha.
[16-May-2014 22:30:23]  <ponicalica> of course Rin didn't tell Ayako anything either.
[16-May-2014 22:31:03]  <IllFlower> No, that just means it's your chance to make things up. :D
[16-May-2014 22:31:09]  <BGTB2005> there is the sorta-non-answer Rin gave as justification in the last session
[16-May-2014 22:33:38]  <ponicalica> "All she told me was that they made her life hell.  I know that before Saki took me in there were a few kids who liked to make me feel bad for having my head in a book all the time, but nothing that would make me want to punch them now..."
[16-May-2014 22:36:41]  <Alicia> Taking in what Ayako has to say, Hikari briefly goes silent. "Well, thank you." She turns to Rin. "I think it's best that you stay this one out. We are here to find out information for Yumiko, and need to handle Michi carefully. Could you maybe go grab us some snacks, please?"
[16-May-2014 22:37:07]  <Alicia> Hikari shuffles around, trying to not be tactless. "At least, you will be away from Tsubaki."
[16-May-2014 22:37:14]  <BGTB2005> "Yeah, sure."
[16-May-2014 22:37:23]  <Alicia> "Thank you."
[16-May-2014 22:38:21]  <ponicalica> and now I guess we walk to wherever Michi is?
[16-May-2014 22:38:43]  <IllFlower> She's in a waiting room.
[16-May-2014 22:39:02]  <ponicalica> Or then I guess walk over to Michi?
[16-May-2014 22:39:48]  <IllFlower> Yeah, whatever works.
[16-May-2014 22:40:53]  <IllFlower> Michi's alone, poking at her cell phone. The hospital isn't that busy, so there are conveniently a large number of empty seats near her.
[16-May-2014 22:41:37]  <ponicalica> Ayako walks towards Michi's seat, taking one almost adjacent.
[16-May-2014 22:42:36]  <ponicalica> "Uh...Michi, right?"
[16-May-2014 22:43:21]  <IllFlower> "Hm?" Michi turns to look at Ayako. "Oh, it's you."
[16-May-2014 22:43:51]  <ponicalica> What's the tone of that supposed to be? >_>
[16-May-2014 22:44:16]  <IllFlower> "It's good to see you're not hurt too badly." Michi puts away her phone.
[16-May-2014 22:44:18]  <IllFlower> "Did you know that girl?" she asks Ayako.
[16-May-2014 22:44:34]  <IllFlower> ("HOW ARE YOU GENTLEMEN")
[16-May-2014 22:45:35]  <Alicia> ( :? )
[16-May-2014 22:45:53]  <ponicalica> "You mean Rin?  I know her, though not too well."
[16-May-2014 22:47:08]  <IllFlower> "Is she a classmate of yours or something?"
[16-May-2014 22:49:32]  <ponicalica> "...Sort of.  She seemed to really have it out for your friend for some reason.  I got in the middle.  It was a bad idea."
[16-May-2014 22:50:12]  <IllFlower> "Either way, I appreciate it."
[16-May-2014 22:50:58]  <IllFlower> Michi changes tack. "So what brought you to my building? Bad luck?" she asks in a lighthearted tone.
[16-May-2014 22:51:56]  <Alicia> Hikari sits down across from Ayako, next to Michi. "Excuse me, I'm with Ayako here. Pleased to-" she stops, answering instead. "We were following along, not really going anywhere with Rin, until... that happened."
[16-May-2014 22:54:51]  <IllFlower> "So bad luck." Michi laughs.
[16-May-2014 22:55:05]  <IllFlower> "You have some interesting friends," she says, looking at Ayako in particular.
[16-May-2014 22:57:38]  <ponicalica> "Hm?"
[16-May-2014 22:58:51]  <IllFlower> "It's nothing. Just... a little unexpected.
[16-May-2014 22:59:54]  <IllFlower> "How do I say it? If I had to guess, you're kind of a straight arrow.
[16-May-2014 23:00:45]  <IllFlower> "No offense to you," she says to Hikari. "But you don't seem the type. And definitely not your friend," she says, jerking her head back towards the exit.
[16-May-2014 23:01:28]  <Alicia> (Er, sorry. Seem the type to get into trouble?)
[16-May-2014 23:01:42]  <ponicalica> She's saying that Hikari and Rin clearly aren't straight-arrow types
[16-May-2014 23:01:47]  <Alicia> Oh, ooh.
[16-May-2014 23:02:03]  <Alicia> (Oh I see it now. Sorry.)
[16-May-2014 23:06:11]  <ponicalica> "Hikari, what was the name of that girl you were talking to us about earlier?  Yumiko?"
[16-May-2014 23:06:19]  <Alicia> Hikari forces herself to hold her smile. "Well, I guess it fits, haha." she responds, not really sure what to say. "And Rin definitely has surprises in her." She tries to laugh, failing."
[16-May-2014 23:06:53]  <ponicalica> The goal, after all, was to figure out more about Yumiko, and there was little space for a good opening.
[16-May-2014 23:07:04]  <Alicia> She looks over. "Yes, Yumiko was her name. She's not doing too well, unfortunately."
[16-May-2014 23:07:04]  <ponicalica> also I think Hikari's line should come before Ayako's.  :V
[16-May-2014 23:07:17]  <Alicia> (Yeah, bad timing. Sorry.)
[16-May-2014 23:07:56]  <IllFlower> Is this within earshot of Michi?
[16-May-2014 23:08:26]  <ponicalica> Given that I think Michi's now between Ayako and Hikari, the answer's yes.
[16-May-2014 23:08:31]  *** jseblan <~chatzilla@CPEbcc81007908e-CMbcc81007908b.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 186 seconds)
[16-May-2014 23:09:04]  <Alicia> I believe ponner's going for bringing her up to Hikari, so as to ask Michi, somehow.
[16-May-2014 23:09:18]  <IllFlower> Michi's visibly taken aback by the shift in the conversation.
[16-May-2014 23:09:33]  <IllFlower> "Yumiko? You don't mean Kayano, do you?"
[16-May-2014 23:10:45]  <ponicalica> "I think so.  You know her?"
[16-May-2014 23:11:25]  <IllFlower> You think so? lol
[16-May-2014 23:12:48]  <ponicalica> yeah that was poorly phrased.  Whatever.  Ayako's not the greatest at this "talking about magical things without letting on that they're magical" thing, I guess
[16-May-2014 23:13:29]  <IllFlower> "Are you...? Wait, hold on a second."
[16-May-2014 23:13:52]  <IllFlower> Michi looks up at the ceiling and calls a single name. "Nyoma?"
[16-May-2014 23:14:07]  <IllFlower> Sure enough, with a flash, the familiar appears on her lap.
[16-May-2014 23:17:18]  <IllFlower> **
[16-May-2014 23:19:22]  <Alicia> (I'm not sure what to sya. >_<)
[16-May-2014 23:19:43]  <ponicalica> (same >_< I guess probably we should just admit to being conservators, since Nyoma would know for sure anyways)
[16-May-2014 23:20:17]  <BGTB2005> (Should Rin return with cookies now?)
[16-May-2014 23:21:40]  <Alicia> (Will she want to punch Michi for associating with her? :P)
[16-May-2014 23:21:45]  <Alicia> (Also I dunno.)
[16-May-2014 23:22:51]  <IllFlower> Noticing the lack of reaction from the two girls, Michi deduces what's going on.
[16-May-2014 23:23:00]  <IllFlower> "You're initiates, aren't you?"
[16-May-2014 23:25:35]  <Alicia> "Yes, we are. And you are as well, naturally."
[16-May-2014 23:27:02]  <IllFlower> "Of course.
[16-May-2014 23:27:08]  <IllFlower> "What about your friend Rin?"
[16-May-2014 23:28:10]  <ponicalica> "She is as well."
[16-May-2014 23:28:33]  <IllFlower> "So I take it you all were looking for me, then."
[16-May-2014 23:28:59]  <ponicalica> "That...that would be right."
[16-May-2014 23:29:28]  <ponicalica> Ayako looked at Hikari, with a bit of concern.  Michi definitely had a talent for reading people.
[16-May-2014 23:30:01]  <IllFlower> Well, I mean, she's probably the only initiate in that dorm block...
[16-May-2014 23:30:30]  <ponicalica> I was also thinking of the straight-shooter thing was probably supposed to imply that.  Maybe I'm being dumb.
[16-May-2014 23:30:44]  <Alicia> (I was too.)
[16-May-2014 23:30:58]  <IllFlower> Oh, yeah, maybe.
[16-May-2014 23:31:14]  <IllFlower> It was more of an oblique reference to Ayako being rather more bookish than the other two.
[16-May-2014 23:31:39]  <IllFlower> Anyway --
[16-May-2014 23:32:48]  <IllFlower> Nyoma, who up until this point doesn't seem to have realized where he is, slides off of Michi's lap and onto the ground, looking at the three girls.
[16-May-2014 23:33:12]  <IllFlower> "Michi?" He scans his eyes across the group. "And you two were... the ones I just saw a little while ago?"
[16-May-2014 23:33:56]  <IllFlower> He returns his eyes to Michi. "Did you need me for something?"
[16-May-2014 23:34:27]  <IllFlower> "I was just testing these two," Michi says. "Sorry. I didn't know they were initiates."
[16-May-2014 23:35:39]  <IllFlower> Nyoma corrects her. "They're not just initiates. They're Conservators. If I remember right, I sent them to talk to you about Kayano..."
[16-May-2014 23:35:56]  <IllFlower> (Not pictured: Ayako and Hikari making D: faces.)
[16-May-2014 23:36:03]  <ponicalica> basically
[16-May-2014 23:36:37]  <IllFlower> "Ah, that would explain it..." Michi says.
[16-May-2014 23:36:41]  <Alicia> (Hikari would never do that in this situation.)
[16-May-2014 23:37:01]  <IllFlower> "Where's the other girl that was with you two?" Nyoma asks.
[16-May-2014 23:37:34]  <IllFlower> "Other girl?" Michi repeats. "You don't mean..."
[16-May-2014 23:41:23]  <Alicia> "Nyoma means Rin."
[16-May-2014 23:42:01]  <IllFlower> "She's a Conservator?"
[16-May-2014 23:42:08]  <ponicalica> "We don't quite know why Rin attacked your friend.  But we do know that Yumiko's in trouble."
[16-May-2014 23:42:31]  <IllFlower> Michi buries her head in her hands, trying to come to some understanding of the situation.
[16-May-2014 23:43:16]  <IllFlower> "Okay, let's leave your colleague aside for now. What's happened to Kayano?"
[16-May-2014 23:44:13]  <ponicalica> "Nyoma reported flares, and when we went to examine, she...tried to kill herself."
[16-May-2014 23:44:49]  <Alicia> "Kayano is a mess right now, even if we managed to stop her from killing herself."
[16-May-2014 23:45:45]  <IllFlower> "Is she okay?"
[16-May-2014 23:45:54]  <IllFlower> Michi's voice seems to hold genuine concern.
[16-May-2014 23:47:00]  <ponicalica> "For now.  But she wasn't really able to explain the situations that led to this very well.  We were hoping you might give another perspective."
[16-May-2014 23:47:35]  <Alicia> "She's hanging on, thankfully. The issues have subsided a little bit, at least for now."
[16-May-2014 23:48:12]  <IllFlower> "I wish I could say this was totally unexpected.
[16-May-2014 23:48:16]  <IllFlower> "She's always been a bit more... I think 'distant' is the word.
[16-May-2014 23:49:15]  <IllFlower> "I and the other girls under Nyoma's watch have been trying to welcome her into the group, but so far she hasn't taken us up on it."
[16-May-2014 23:49:39]  <BGTB2005> ("Have you tried offering her tea and cookies?")
[16-May-2014 23:49:48]  <ponicalica> pffff
[16-May-2014 23:52:44]  <ponicalica> "Welcome her into the group?"
[16-May-2014 23:54:39]  <IllFlower> I dunno what you're getting at.
[16-May-2014 23:55:08]  <IllFlower> Though you probably don't know what I'm getting at, either. Hm.
[16-May-2014 23:55:34]  <ponicalica> I'm not entirely sure what Michi means by "welcoming her into the group" >_>
[16-May-2014 23:55:42]  <IllFlower> "Yeah. We try to band together. We are all comrades under the same familiar, after all."
[16-May-2014 23:56:18]  <BGTB2005> (My personal WMG: it probably has something to do with the 'fitness test' Hikari knows about)
[16-May-2014 23:56:54]  <IllFlower> Perceptive.

[17-May-2014 00:00:05]  <IllFlower> "I don't know. I've tried talking to her, but she's not very forthcoming about these things.
[17-May-2014 00:00:19]  <IllFlower> "I've heard some nasty things about her circumstances, though."
[17-May-2014 00:00:52]  <ponicalica> "She wouldn't say much more to us than that she came from Kobe."
[17-May-2014 00:02:35]  <IllFlower> "Right. I think there's good reason for that. She'd have reasons to lie low if what I hear is true."
[17-May-2014 00:03:48]  <Alicia> "What have you heard about her?"
[17-May-2014 00:05:46]  <IllFlower> Michi sighs, then starts hesitantly.
[17-May-2014 00:06:36]  <IllFlower> "I can't verify this, but it seems like her father was involved in some business with the yakuza in Kobe. He got on their bad side and was forced to flee."
[17-May-2014 00:09:20]  <ponicalica> "Hmm."  Ayako looks at Hikari, unsure of what to ask next.
[17-May-2014 00:11:02]  <Alicia> "That's unsettling. So perhaps she had a run in with the yakuza that still disturbs her?"
[17-May-2014 00:14:22]  <IllFlower> Ah, oops. Just a second.
[17-May-2014 00:14:25]  <ponicalica> okay

[17-May-2014 00:15:10]  <IllFlower> "That could be it. Then again, to be honest, I think it could be anything.

[17-May-2014 00:19:08]  <ponicalica> I just had a terrible idea that I have no idea how to work in.  Ask about Wataru wrt his flirting with Hikari in a way that would get Michi to talk about him.  I don't know if this would actually accomplish anything either but it could be fun.
[17-May-2014 00:19:20]  <Alicia> Oh my gosh.
[17-May-2014 00:19:27]  <IllFlower> Rin sure is taking her time with those drinks.
[17-May-2014 00:19:47]  <Alicia> She's been kicking down trash cans along the way to sate her anger, surely.
[17-May-2014 00:20:02]  <BGTB2005> Machine ate her money
[17-May-2014 00:20:12]  <ponicalica> I think IllFlower is suggesting BGT arrive about now, maybe?
[17-May-2014 00:20:37]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Mostly, what could be gained from Michi discussing Wataru? That's what I'm not sure about.
[17-May-2014 00:20:47]  <Alicia> Aside from, of course, also being in with the crowd.
[17-May-2014 00:21:04]  <ponicalica> Alicia: I assume there's some animosity there, but I dunno.
[17-May-2014 00:21:09]  <Alicia> poAah.
[17-May-2014 00:21:11]  <ponicalica> I'm just sort of in an "out of ideas" state, so
[17-May-2014 00:21:53]  <Alicia> ponicalica:*
[17-May-2014 00:22:50]  <ponicalica> "And when you fought witches together, what went wrong?"
[17-May-2014 00:23:07]  <BGTB2005> (Rin can return now?)
[17-May-2014 00:23:15]  <ponicalica> I think so, yeah
[17-May-2014 00:23:22]  <IllFlower> Yeah, she can come back whenever.
[17-May-2014 00:24:18]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: "She's prone to doing her own thing all the time. It's like she doesn't want anything to do with us -- just wants to do it all on her own."
[17-May-2014 00:25:24]  <BGTB2005> Rin returns to the waiting room, having taken a trip to the nearby convenience store

[17-May-2014 00:28:11]  <ponicalica> Ayako looks at Rin, not sure whether to call her over or not, considering her comments on what she wants to do to Michi.
[17-May-2014 00:28:28]  <BGTB2005> Locating the others, Rin finds a nearby empty seat and dumps the contents of the bags in it.
[17-May-2014 00:28:37]  <BGTB2005> "I didn't know what everyone wanted, so I bought tea and cookies."
[17-May-2014 00:30:52]  <ponicalica> "Thanks."  Ayako picks up a cookie and begins to chew.  "Michi, you can have some too, if you want."
[17-May-2014 00:32:06]  <IllFlower> "Oh, thank you..." Michi takes a bottle of tea.
[17-May-2014 00:32:17]  <Alicia> "Much appreciated, Rin."
[17-May-2014 00:33:22]  *** SF_Sorrow <SF_Sorrow@college8-34-39.resnet.ucsc.edu> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 380 seconds)
[17-May-2014 00:33:22]  <IllFlower> She seems a bit skittish about Rin's presence, for perhaps understandable reasons, but it seems that with the two other girls and Nyoma around, she's a bit more at ease.
[17-May-2014 00:34:09]  <ponicalica> Hmm, Hikari hasn't told Ayako or Rin about the "fitness test", has she?  And of course there's probably no good way to work that in, is there
[17-May-2014 00:35:16]  <BGTB2005> Taking a cookie and a bottle of tea for herself, Rin sits in another vacant seat and, beyond acknowledging thanks, she tries to ignore Michi's presence
[17-May-2014 00:35:45]  <ponicalica> yeah I really don't know what to say next >_<
[17-May-2014 00:36:03]  <Alicia> ponicalica: I thought Hikari might have informed her in the meantime, like before talking up Michi.
[17-May-2014 00:36:22]  <ponicalica> Oh, maybe.
[17-May-2014 00:36:32]  <BGTB2005> (I was figuring Hikari would probably share what she knows while the three return to Shii's base, unless their familiar decides to pop in)
[17-May-2014 00:36:53]  <BGTB2005> (also what was learned from their chat while Rin was shopping)
[17-May-2014 00:36:56]  <Alicia> I mean that's how Hikari's been so far.
[17-May-2014 00:36:57]  <ponicalica> Alicia, BGTB2005: do you think there's any more we can get out of Michi?
[17-May-2014 00:37:28]  <Alicia> ponicalica: I'm not sure, though anything else we do will have to be, er, extra careful considering Michi already knows.
[17-May-2014 00:37:44]  <BGTB2005> Rin's trying to pretend Michi isn't there in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the last session
[17-May-2014 00:38:13]  <BGTB2005> especially since there's a familiar present
[17-May-2014 00:38:17]  <BGTB2005> and security cameras
[17-May-2014 00:38:45]  <ponicalica> "Thanks for trying to help us.  We hope to be able to get Yumiko back on her feet and helping you soon..."
[17-May-2014 00:38:47]  <IllFlower> And, you know, other people.
[17-May-2014 00:39:03]  <IllFlower> "I'm glad I could be of help," Michi says.
[17-May-2014 00:39:05]  <BGTB2005> that too

[17-May-2014 00:40:08]  <IllFlower> Right on cue, Tsubaki walks into the waiting room. It looks like she hasn't taken too serious a beating. Her face is bandaged, but still recognizable.
[17-May-2014 00:40:36]  <ponicalica> and now Rin has to fight the urge to punch her again
[17-May-2014 00:40:38]  <IllFlower> "I should take Tsubaki back," Michi says. "It was good talking to you."
[17-May-2014 00:41:39]  <Alicia> "We appreciate it, Michi. Take care."
[17-May-2014 00:43:53]  <ponicalica> next: Shii again, or? (I assume reporting to Shii after what just happened with Rin would be pretty important)
[17-May-2014 00:44:19]  <Alicia> Yeah, definitely Shii.
[17-May-2014 00:44:58]  <Alicia> With Michi talked to Hikari'd be reporting that.
[17-May-2014 00:45:18]  <IllFlower> Shall we go, then?
[17-May-2014 00:45:23]  <ponicalica> Yeah
[17-May-2014 00:45:37]  <Alicia> Mmmhm.
[17-May-2014 00:45:43]  <BGTB2005> sure
[17-May-2014 00:46:27]  <IllFlower> FFWD>>
[17-May-2014 00:47:04]  <IllFlower> The Conservators, having left the hospital, are now back talking to Shii in the church.
[17-May-2014 00:47:44]  <IllFlower> Shii tells them that Yumiko's been doing fine in the meantime.
[17-May-2014 00:47:56]  <IllFlower> "How did your investigation go?" she asks the girls.
[17-May-2014 00:48:13]  <ponicalica> Ayako looks at Rin, then looks back at Shii.
[17-May-2014 00:48:31]  <IllFlower> "Is something the matter?"
[17-May-2014 00:48:50]  <ponicalica> "Not very well. Rin, uh, attacked Michi's roommate."
[17-May-2014 00:49:03]  <Alicia> "She had to get sent to the hospital."
[17-May-2014 00:49:49]  <IllFlower> Shii looks at Rin with some alarm.
[17-May-2014 00:49:53]  <IllFlower> "Is this true, Rin?"
[17-May-2014 00:51:53]  <BGTB2005> "Yes."
[17-May-2014 00:52:13]  <Alicia> (And I'd do it again to, if it weren't for my damn colleagues.)
[17-May-2014 00:52:29]  <BGTB2005> ("At least I didn't use magic.")
[17-May-2014 00:53:16]  <ponicalica> heh, yeah, that would be bad
[17-May-2014 00:53:30]  <ponicalica> just some ashes where Tsubaki used to be.
[17-May-2014 00:53:34]  <IllFlower> "What on earth could have justified attacking a civilian while carrying out your duties?"
[17-May-2014 00:53:45]  <Alicia> Hikari looks at Rin, annoyed by the casualness
[17-May-2014 00:53:46]  <Alicia> .
[17-May-2014 00:53:56]  <BGTB2005> I actually thought of sending something to that effect instead of a simple admission
[17-May-2014 00:54:33]  <ponicalica> The "At least I didn't use magic" line?
[17-May-2014 00:54:37]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[17-May-2014 00:54:56]  <BGTB2005> only minus the first two words there
[17-May-2014 00:55:08]  <IllFlower> Imagine if I was using the magical field laws...
[17-May-2014 00:55:21]  <ponicalica> Magical field laws?
[17-May-2014 00:55:38]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: you could probably say that at the end of your response to "What on earth could have justified...?"

[17-May-2014 00:57:32]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: are you going to respond to the question?
[17-May-2014 00:58:31]  <BGTB2005> trying to think of how to do so
[17-May-2014 00:58:43]  <ponicalica> say something about the bullying, probably
[17-May-2014 00:58:46]  <IllFlower> A quick note - I need to wrap up this session in 45 minutes or so. Just so you all know.
[17-May-2014 01:01:55]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005?
[17-May-2014 01:02:05]  <BGTB2005> "She bullied me, years ago," Rin answers, trying to keep calm
[17-May-2014 01:02:06]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Okay.
[17-May-2014 01:03:39]  <IllFlower> "Rin," Shii says sternly.
[17-May-2014 01:04:12]  <IllFlower> "There is a time and a place for settling those matters, and it's not while you're on the job.
[17-May-2014 01:04:16]  <IllFlower> "Do you understand?"
[17-May-2014 01:05:06]  <BGTB2005> "Yes."
[17-May-2014 01:07:09]  <ponicalica> "You wanted to hurt Michi too.  If we weren't in a hospital, would you have?"
[17-May-2014 01:07:25]  <IllFlower> "Ayako, that's enough," Shii interrupts.
[17-May-2014 01:08:05]  <IllFlower> "Rin was given that crest because the elders trusted her judgment. I have faith that their trust wasn't misplaced," she says, turning to Rin, "but you need to demonstrate that that's the case."
[17-May-2014 01:09:36]  <BGTB2005> (Have Hikari and Ayako shared with Rin what they learned from raiding Michi's place and the chat at the hospital?)
[17-May-2014 01:09:54]  <IllFlower> Now's as good a time as any to discuss it.
[17-May-2014 01:10:26]  <Alicia> "... Anyway, Shii. We weren't able to find out the core reasons behind Yumiko's outbursts. But we have some idea now." Hikari begins, unpacking her bag.
[17-May-2014 01:11:52]  <Alicia> "While there, we also met another guy - Wataru - who clued us in on Michi. But we hit a dead end, except for some other information." She hands the notebook over to Ayako.
[17-May-2014 01:13:01]  <ponicalica> Ayako opens the notebook and flips to the relevant page.
[17-May-2014 01:13:46]  <Alicia> "There's... not much more, other than the rumor of Yumiko potentially being involved with the yakuza, and Michi likely causing issues."
[17-May-2014 01:14:30]  <IllFlower> "That's a lot of information," Shii says.
[17-May-2014 01:14:58]  <IllFlower> "Go back. What does Michi have to do with all of this?"
[17-May-2014 01:15:46]  <ponicalica> "She's one of Nyoma's other initiates.  Apparently she might be partially responsible for her...emotional state."

[17-May-2014 01:17:35]  <Alicia> "She's written about a 'fitness test,' which sounds like little more than bullying."
[17-May-2014 01:20:42]  <IllFlower> "I've never heard of this sort of thing.
[17-May-2014 01:20:55]  <IllFlower> "Did you ask her or Nyoma about it?"
[17-May-2014 01:21:31]  <ponicalica> "No.  The context of the conversation was...a bit awkward, and we were afraid of causing another incident."
[17-May-2014 01:23:11]  <IllFlower> "I see. This is a large missing piece, in my opinion.

[17-May-2014 01:24:09]  <IllFlower> "No, I think this is important," Shii says.
[17-May-2014 01:24:24]  <IllFlower> "If this really is what you suspect, we need evidence."
[17-May-2014 01:26:06]  <Alicia> "You're advising that we head out?"
[17-May-2014 01:26:40]  <IllFlower> "I don't see any better option."
[17-May-2014 01:27:09]  <ponicalica> "Before we head out, can I ask you one thing in private, Shii?"
[17-May-2014 01:27:35]  <IllFlower> The fitness test isn't in the immediate future, just so you know.
[17-May-2014 01:27:48]  <IllFlower> It's a couple of days away, at least.
[17-May-2014 01:28:09]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: But - "yes, go ahead."
[17-May-2014 01:29:06]  <IllFlower> About 15 minutes to go, folks.
[17-May-2014 01:30:12]  <ponicalica> "You said that the elders trusted her judgment.  In order to reach Michi's roommate, Rin had to go through me.  If the elders trust her judgment, so should I, but how do I trust someone when I look at her face and see the person who punched me to get to her...what was the word she used...retribution?"
[17-May-2014 01:31:04]  <IllFlower> Shii thinks for a moment.
[17-May-2014 01:31:25]  <IllFlower> "Do you think she was using that judgment when she turned on you?"

[17-May-2014 01:34:18]  <ponicalica> Ayako thinks.  "She...I don't know.  She made some connection between what Wataru said about Michi and to what this girl did to her."
[17-May-2014 01:35:27]  <IllFlower> "What I'm saying is this, Ayako: Rin lost control of herself, correct?"
[17-May-2014 01:35:56]  <ponicalica> Ayako pauses.  "...Correct."
[17-May-2014 01:37:38]  <IllFlower> "But there are times when she's capable of heroic things as well. Like saving Miss Kayano."
[17-May-2014 01:38:02]  <ponicalica> "She was indeed impressive there."
[17-May-2014 01:40:44]  <IllFlower> "That side of her can conquer her past," Shii says. "I have my confidence that it can. But we both know mere confidence isn't enough. For the time being, you'll need to keep Rin out of situations that might land her or others in danger.
[17-May-2014 01:41:34]  <IllFlower> "In the meantime, we'll see if we can't find some way for her to face her demons that doesn't involve assaulting civilians in the course of carrying out her Conservator duties."
[17-May-2014 01:42:50]  <ponicalica> "I'll keep that in mind.  Thank you."
[17-May-2014 01:43:40]  <IllFlower> "Certainly. I trust *your* judgment in this matter, of course."
[17-May-2014 01:44:23]  <ponicalica> And I suppose this wraps things up?
[17-May-2014 01:44:43]  <IllFlower> I suspect the girls might want to bring up some of what they've learned with Yumiko next time.
[17-May-2014 01:44:50]  <Alicia> For sure.
[17-May-2014 01:45:34]  <IllFlower> Okay, I think this is as good a stopping point as any. Let's break here.
[17-May-2014 01:45:38]  <IllFlower> Thanks again, everyone.
[17-May-2014 01:45:43]  <Alicia> Thanks for having us.
[17-May-2014 01:45:51]  <IllFlower> We likely won't be having a session next week, just so you all know.
[17-May-2014 01:45:51]  <ponicalica> indeed, thanks for having us
[17-May-2014 01:46:25]  <IllFlower> I'll have more details as the date approaches, but if we do have a session it's likely to be on Sunday, or perhaps during the week.
