[09-Aug-2013 20:33:39]  <IllFlower> ponicalica, Rig: Either of you ready to do initiations? We'll go ahead without Barcode since we're unlikely to get through more than one of you before he gets back.
[09-Aug-2013 20:33:49]  <Rig> I'm ready.
[09-Aug-2013 20:33:51]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: I'd rather Rig go first.

[09-Aug-2013 20:35:02]  <ponicalica> isn't CIS also the acronym for the former ussr equivalent of the british commonwealth?

[09-Aug-2013 20:35:13]  <Nitya> great comparison also
[09-Aug-2013 20:35:19]  <Rig> Well, this article talks about how superheroes being set in "grey, gritty worlds" is boring and counterintuitive. Especially with heroes like Superman or The Avengers. And Man of Steel is almost entirely grey with a tiny splash of color for his suit.

[09-Aug-2013 20:35:39]  <Rig> Okay, lemme pull up the manual and stuff.
[09-Aug-2013 20:36:11]  <Saladofstones> wait
[09-Aug-2013 20:36:17]  <Saladofstones> wasn't the avengers the opposite of gritty and dark?
[09-Aug-2013 20:36:30]  <Rig> Yeah, for the most part. But Man of Steel was very dark.
[09-Aug-2013 20:36:52]  <Rig> Okay, IllFlower, what do you need from me?
[09-Aug-2013 20:37:31]  <ponicalica> Rig: first I think is an "I hope" statement

[09-Aug-2013 20:39:08]  <Rig> Cousin of Nodick.
[09-Aug-2013 20:39:17]  <IllFlower> Hm, is that something she's prone to doing to begin with? I'm trying to think of a situation that would fit her character where she'd have to make that decision.

[09-Aug-2013 20:39:55]  <Saladofstones> Rig: "I hope I'm not part of an urobuchi anime"
[09-Aug-2013 20:40:04]  <Rig> She's not.
[09-Aug-2013 20:40:09]  <Rig> She is one of IllFlower's animus.
[09-Aug-2013 20:40:11]  <Saladofstones> but she doesn't know that
[09-Aug-2013 20:40:12]  <Rig> That's even worse.
[09-Aug-2013 20:40:57]  <Rig> How about something along the lines of "I hope I'm ready to deal with other people's problems"?
[09-Aug-2013 20:41:53]  <Barcode> Saladofstones: He'll be fine. He can solve problems without violence and I'll solve all the volumes that require violence. In my gigeresque meteor-hammer-wielding getup.

[09-Aug-2013 20:43:07]  <IllFlower> Rig: How do you mean? I'm trying to think of something concrete.
[09-Aug-2013 20:43:13]  <Alicia> Meteor hammer, yay.
[09-Aug-2013 20:43:21]  <Saladofstones> Illflower cannot parse that command rig
[09-Aug-2013 20:43:24]  <Nitya> Saladofstones: are you implying that somebody masturbated to great teacher onizuka
[09-Aug-2013 20:43:31]  <Rig> Well, it doesn't have to be concrete.
[09-Aug-2013 20:43:32]  <Fiora> Nitya: pfff
[09-Aug-2013 20:43:39]  <Saladofstones> I'm implying there were suspicious stains 
[09-Aug-2013 20:43:41]  <Rig> The rulebook gives examples for less concrete things.
[09-Aug-2013 20:44:01]  <Rig> But like, Jun is faced with some kind of stressful situation that comes from someone else.
[09-Aug-2013 20:45:12]  <IllFlower> Right, but we do have to think of a concrete situation for the conflict to occur in.
[09-Aug-2013 20:46:14]  <Rig> Well, we could do something really mundane like a classmate comes to her with a personal problem. Or we could do something more magical, like a member of her old group comes to her dealing with some bad memories.
[09-Aug-2013 20:46:21]  <Barcode> Saving a suicidal person?
[09-Aug-2013 20:46:47]  <Rig> > has issues beating up 16 year old fictional girls
[09-Aug-2013 20:46:53]  <Rig> > tries to kill one off in the first session
[09-Aug-2013 20:47:11]  <IllFlower> Hm, I think Barcode put a finger on it, actually.
[09-Aug-2013 20:47:15]  <Barcode> No, you're /saving/ them >:I
[09-Aug-2013 20:47:52]  <IllFlower> I was kind of confused since Jun's character seems to already be the kind of self-sacrificial person who would have to deal with external stress, but suicide is a much more internal trauma.
[09-Aug-2013 20:47:58]  <Barcode> my character's the one that's liable to pretend punching them is the best solution.
[09-Aug-2013 20:48:26]  * ponicalica still has pretty much no idea what a good hope is
[09-Aug-2013 20:48:40]  <Saladofstones> clearly we have the most functional group to become fixers
[09-Aug-2013 20:48:48]  <Rig> I'm good with that.
[09-Aug-2013 20:49:32]  <IllFlower> i.e. if someone comes to her with a problem that's caused by a third party, she'd be used to picking out that third party as an enemy and fighting that enemy, but with suicide you can't really put yourself in between the person who wants to exact violence and him/herself.
[09-Aug-2013 20:49:56]  <Rig> Yeah, that makes sense.
[09-Aug-2013 20:50:07]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Fear of blood, physical violence, etc. that she wants to overcome, maybe.
[09-Aug-2013 20:50:55]  <IllFlower> Rig: Okay, let's roll with that. "I hope my character saved someone from committing suicide."
[09-Aug-2013 20:51:12]  <Rig> Okay. Set the stage then?
[09-Aug-2013 20:51:26]  <IllFlower> Yup.
[09-Aug-2013 20:51:54]  <Rig> I was hoping you'd do so, I mean. I've got no good place to start with this one.
[09-Aug-2013 20:51:58]  <IllFlower> I'd say that since this is a d6 trait, it can't be someone too close.
[09-Aug-2013 20:52:13]  <Barcode> Saladofstones: When you're a magical white-furred pink-eyed monstrosity, maybe magically-influenced human problems /all/ seem best solved with an extensible baton.
[09-Aug-2013 20:52:58]  <IllFlower> Rig: Do you think school would be a reasonable place? She stumbles on someone in an empty classroom coming back from, let's say, kendo practice.
[09-Aug-2013 20:53:06]  <Rig> Yeah, that seems good.
[09-Aug-2013 20:54:32]  <IllFlower> Let's say our classmate is holding a knife of some sort and is clearly in distress...
[09-Aug-2013 20:55:28]  <IllFlower> Anything you'd like to add? If not, I think you should be the first to Raise.
[09-Aug-2013 20:55:47]  <Rig> No, I don't think there is anything to add.

[09-Aug-2013 21:02:30]  <IllFlower> The classmate says nothing, seeming to ignore Jun's question. She merely continues to stare glassily in silence, turning the knife over and over. See 24, leave 12688X.

[09-Aug-2013 21:04:15]  <IllFlower> After a moment, the classmate begins muttering to herself, pointing the knife at various parts of her body and making tremulous slashing motions across them. Neck, chest, arms... Raise 16, leave 288X.

[09-Aug-2013 21:05:04]  <IllFlower> Miming it, for now.
[09-Aug-2013 21:06:52]  * Jun crosses the room and touches the girl on the arm, trying to get her attention. She still can't remember her name. "Hey, seriously, what's wrong?" See 45, leave 566.
[09-Aug-2013 21:09:54]  <Jun> Her name comes to Jun suddenly. "Akemi, right? What can I do to help you? I don't want you to hurt yourself." Jun places her hand on Akemi's knife hand. Raise 66, leave 5. Gonna pull in my "showing you care trait" now.

[09-Aug-2013 21:10:51]  <Jun> Just picked the first name I could remember.
[09-Aug-2013 21:11:40]  <IllFlower> Would this count as an escalation to physical?
[09-Aug-2013 21:11:58]  <Jun> I don't think so. I'm not grabbing her hand, just putting my hand on it.
[09-Aug-2013 21:12:18]  <Jun> Though I guess it could be seen as escalation.
[09-Aug-2013 21:12:24]  <Jun> What do you think, ponicalica & Barcode 
[09-Aug-2013 21:13:03]  <ponicalica> I think it would depend on how forcefully it was done, maybe?
[09-Aug-2013 21:13:15]  <Barcode> I was thinking it's an indication/improved capacity to physically intervene...it makes sense to me. I mean, IF can escalate to physical too, I guess, if Akemi gets to actually trying to cut herself.
[09-Aug-2013 21:13:24]  <Jun> Well, there is a physical arena for not fighting.
[09-Aug-2013 21:13:28]  <IllFlower> Akemi shakes her hand free of Jun's. See 2X. She takes the knife and steadies it near her neck, seeming to feel around with it for an important artery. She still has not said a word. Raise 88, leave none.
[09-Aug-2013 21:13:29]  <Barcode> Yeah, s'what i was thinking.
[09-Aug-2013 21:13:41]  <Barcode> well.
[09-Aug-2013 21:13:41]  <IllFlower> Escalation would confer no advantage to me, since I'm stuck at 4d6+4d10 no matter what.
[09-Aug-2013 21:14:31]  <Barcode> Like, as per first-conflict rules, i assume.
[09-Aug-2013 21:14:42]  <Barcode> (i don't know the gm side of it)
[09-Aug-2013 21:15:20]  <Jun> Okay, I'm gonna escalate now.
[09-Aug-2013 21:15:37]  <IllFlower> Okay, roll 4d6 Bd.

[09-Aug-2013 21:16:19]  <IllFlower> Three threes, in fact.
[09-Aug-2013 21:16:23]  <Jun> Shouldn't it actually be both the relevant traits and I get a new dice pool?
[09-Aug-2013 21:16:41]  <Barcode> IIRC you just get the extra dice from the trait you haven't used yet.
[09-Aug-2013 21:16:54]  <Jun> Okay, that's fine. Just want to be certain.
[09-Aug-2013 21:17:16]  <IllFlower> Yeah, you've already used Ht, so for physical conflict you only have Bd left.
[09-Aug-2013 21:20:17]  <IllFlower> 12333355 on your side.
[09-Aug-2013 21:21:11]  * Jun takes Akemi's wrist in her hand and twists, trying to pull the knife free. Her stance is clumsy and Akemi pulls against her. See 5533, leaving 1233, taking 4d6 fallout (I think). Desperate to get the knife away from her Jun resorts to a clumsy judo throw and ends up smashing Akemi onto the teacher's desk. Raise 33, leaving 21.
[09-Aug-2013 21:21:24]  <Jun> ((Not an ideal resolution.))
[09-Aug-2013 21:21:32]  <IllFlower> Yeah, 4d6 fallout.
[09-Aug-2013 21:22:00]  <IllFlower> Akemi has no further dice, so she gives.
[09-Aug-2013 21:22:11]  <IllFlower> The impact of being thrown against the teacher's desk causes the knife to slip from her hand onto the floor.
[09-Aug-2013 21:22:34]  <IllFlower> It doesn't look like Jun's done too much damage, thankfully.
[09-Aug-2013 21:23:20]  <IllFlower> Akemi continues to stare at the ceiling for a moment, then closes her eyes and begins to cry softly.
[09-Aug-2013 21:23:28]  <IllFlower> **
[09-Aug-2013 21:23:58]  <IllFlower> (Barcode, ponicalica: Which one of you wants to go next, once we close out on this scene?)
[09-Aug-2013 21:24:09]  <Barcode> I've got a bunch of ideas.
[09-Aug-2013 21:24:46]  * Jun says "I'm sorry, Akemi." She kicks the knife into a corner and tries to help the crying girl up and to the nurse's office. She feels weak and helpless suddenly.
[09-Aug-2013 21:25:17]  <Jun> ((Shall I roll fallout and see if the nurse needs to save me?))
[09-Aug-2013 21:25:31]  <ponicalica> I don't have a bunch, so I'll let Barcode go
[09-Aug-2013 21:25:51]  <IllFlower> Just a second.
[09-Aug-2013 21:26:12]  <IllFlower> Yeah, go ahead and roll for your fallout.
[09-Aug-2013 21:26:14]  * Barcode looks at fallout. uh, sheesh, didn't realize that'd resolve that nastily
[09-Aug-2013 21:26:31]  <Jun> +roll 4d6
[09-Aug-2013 21:26:31]  <rollermine> Jun: (3+2+2+4)=11
[09-Aug-2013 21:26:49]  <Jun> Short term.
[09-Aug-2013 21:26:52]  <IllFlower> Yup. 7.
[09-Aug-2013 21:27:10]  <IllFlower> Don't forget to take your initatory d6 trait.
[09-Aug-2013 21:27:23]  <Jun> Okay, I'm gonna take a d4 trait for the next conflict as well.
[09-Aug-2013 21:27:29]  <ponicalica> gj saving homura, Jun
[09-Aug-2013 21:28:37]  <IllFlower> I like the cut of your gib.
[09-Aug-2013 21:28:52]  <IllFlower> Okay, I think we're done with Jun's initiation, so let's move on to Hitomi.
[09-Aug-2013 21:29:01]  * Barcode tosses some stuff aside
[09-Aug-2013 21:29:12]  <Jun> ((That went far worse than Gideon's initiation))
[09-Aug-2013 21:29:43]  <Barcode> Heh, well.
[09-Aug-2013 21:29:52]  <Barcode> Alright, so, - hold on, let's use my desktop for easier typin'
[09-Aug-2013 21:30:08]  <IllFlower> Jun: I did have a contingency in place if you lost; she'd get medical attention and survive, essentially. Having Akemi actually die would have been too severe for a d6.
[09-Aug-2013 21:30:26]  <Jun> Yeah, I figured taking fallout would be character appropriate anyway.

[09-Aug-2013 21:31:44]  <Barcode_> Okay, I had a few things of varying theatrics thought out, but thus far I was thinking the most condusive to narrative thing would be to have something related to either being - or trying to learn not to be - a lone wolf.
[09-Aug-2013 21:32:09]  <Barcode_> The one phrase I had laying around was "I hope my character learns to trust others' judgement."
[09-Aug-2013 21:32:22]  <IllFlower> That sounds like a good one.
[09-Aug-2013 21:32:25]  <Jun> "I hope I can learn to be on a team," Hitomi says as she dribbles the basketball.
[09-Aug-2013 21:32:55]  <IllFlower> We could have this be in a magical situation - or what Jun said, haha.
[09-Aug-2013 21:32:58]  <Barcode_> heheh.
[09-Aug-2013 21:33:29]  <Jun> Where is that gif of the anime girl playing basketball in the most shoujo way possible?

[09-Aug-2013 21:34:17]  <IllFlower> Barcode_: Any strong feelings for a stage?
[09-Aug-2013 21:34:36]  <Barcode_> Typin'.
[09-Aug-2013 21:35:03]  <Barcode_> I was gonna say, the one thing I thought was a witch combat situation/something that could lead to one, which obviously wouldn't be good for a single initiate. Or, we could owrk off something simpler/less deadly a bit in the past if you think that's better.
[09-Aug-2013 21:35:18]  <Barcode_> simpler/less deadly/less blatantly theatric/what not
[09-Aug-2013 21:35:37]  <IllFlower> The former situation could work, given that the witch isn't going to be the opponent in the conflict.
[09-Aug-2013 21:35:54]  <Jun> Yeah, you could even use fun time tricks to frame it.
[09-Aug-2013 21:36:06]  <Jun> Series of flashbacks to times that you managed to work as a team with people.
[09-Aug-2013 21:36:22]  * Jun realizes that he just suggested timeshit to barcode.
[09-Aug-2013 21:36:37]  <Barcode_> Haha. Time skipping is a narrative device, I'm well aware of that.
[09-Aug-2013 21:36:39]  <IllFlower> That makes me wonder if you could nest conflicts, haha. In the middle of a witch fight, the team starts to squabble over tactics.
[09-Aug-2013 21:36:51]  <Jun> I don't see why not.
[09-Aug-2013 21:36:59]  <Barcode_> oh god. matroyshka conflicts. 2:1 turns
[09-Aug-2013 21:37:03]  <Jun> The stacks of the inner conflict would reflect on the outer conflict.
[09-Aug-2013 21:37:07]  <Jun> *stakes
[09-Aug-2013 21:37:12]  <Barcode_> matroyshkonflicts*
[09-Aug-2013 21:37:34]  <Alicia> (That sounds fun.)
[09-Aug-2013 21:37:38]  <ponicalica> that would be a bitch to keep track of
[09-Aug-2013 21:37:55]  <IllFlower> Barcode_: But yeah, I was thinking that she'd have an argument over tactics with a fellow initiate, something like that.
[09-Aug-2013 21:38:42]  <Barcode_> Hm. Well yeah, we could ignore the actual witch fight/leave that up to wehat you think would happen after the actual argument.
[09-Aug-2013 21:39:07]  <Barcode_> though if its' gonna be in the /middle/ of a fight the conflict would probably have to be weirdly brief.
[09-Aug-2013 21:39:11]  <Barcode_> could always be beforehand.
[09-Aug-2013 21:39:21]  <IllFlower> That would be the simplest solution.
[09-Aug-2013 21:40:03]  <Barcode_> hm. well, considering ponny's character, it could be like. newbie with some idea of tactics, while Hitomi's got a witch or at least a few towns under her belt.
[09-Aug-2013 21:40:44]  <IllFlower> A clash between someone driven by instinct (Hitomi) and someone driven by logic, then?
[09-Aug-2013 21:40:46]  <Barcode_> some idea of tactics --> tactician training, iunno. Training From General Kyubric
[09-Aug-2013 21:40:54]  <Barcode_> Could do that.
[09-Aug-2013 21:42:02]  <Barcode_> I guess a thing could be like, Hitomi's confident in her abilities in a stand-up fight, because she's beaten down an initiate or two, but she's never had to actually fight a witch, while the newbie's fought on a few teams before that have beaten witches.
[09-Aug-2013 21:42:11]  <ponicalica> 14lol, it's Hitomi vs totally-not-Ayako?
[09-Aug-2013 21:42:26]  <Barcode_> So Hitomi doesn't know what to do but doesn't think any actual coordination is necessary.
[09-Aug-2013 21:42:35]  <IllFlower> They're looking at a manifested witch in a building somewhere, and Hitomi wants to attack head-on while her foil would prefer a more plotted-through approach...
[09-Aug-2013 21:42:47]  <Barcode_> Shore.
[09-Aug-2013 21:42:52]  *** Barcode_ is now known as Hitomi_Yano
[09-Aug-2013 21:42:54]  <IllFlower> lol, I wonder if I could initiate the two of you simultaneously, haha.
[09-Aug-2013 21:43:17]  <IllFlower> Hitomi and Ayako are up against their first witch and disagree over how to solve the problem...
[09-Aug-2013 21:43:37]  <Hitomi_Yano> Would that work out okay, as far as the conflict rules go? i mean, if you have to have certain dice and stuff.
[09-Aug-2013 21:43:38]  <Jun> Well, then it's them against each other and not you.
[09-Aug-2013 21:43:50]  <IllFlower> Yeah, I just remembered that. Oh, well.
[09-Aug-2013 21:43:53]  <ponicalica> 14eh, I don't think my first initiation should be so...unorthodox.
[09-Aug-2013 21:44:04]  <Jun> IllFlower's into the kink.
[09-Aug-2013 21:44:17]  <ponicalica> also I probably shouldn't ^C14 until the RPing part actually starts
[09-Aug-2013 21:44:18]  <IllFlower> Hitomi_Yano: Roll Ac+Wl = 9d6.
[09-Aug-2013 21:44:22]  <Hitomi_Yano> yes, sir.

[09-Aug-2013 21:47:51]  <IllFlower> Hitomi and another initiate, let's call him Ootani (surname), are on the way to take down a witch that's appeared in the lobby of an old apartment building.
[09-Aug-2013 21:49:10]  <IllFlower> Ootani speaks up first. "We should go around the back of the building," he says. "I don't like where all that broken glass is out front. We could easily die a death of a thousand cuts." Raise 45, leave 233469.
[09-Aug-2013 21:49:14]  <IllFlower> **

[09-Aug-2013 21:54:22]  <Hitomi_Yano> my fake tactics suck. appropriate!
[09-Aug-2013 21:54:23]  <Hitomi_Yano> Hitomi narrows her eyes. "What? When we're costumed the glass shouldn't be much of an issue." 0,15See 45, leave 2223345. "Let's just rush it up front. It'll probably see us coming either way and we're late as it is." 0,15Raise 24, leave 22335.
[09-Aug-2013 21:55:11]  <Hitomi_Yano> hitomi wouldn't be aware of whatever area-l restrictions a witch would have, if any, i suppose.
[09-Aug-2013 21:55:45]  <IllFlower> You can leave the colors as-is. They show up as white-on-white for me anyway. `_`
[09-Aug-2013 21:55:52]  <Hitomi_Yano> ah, shit. sorry.
[09-Aug-2013 21:58:16]  <IllFlower> "Witches have a way of making things issues. If we rush it head-on, it might get ideas involving swirling vortexes, and I'm not up for those." See 24.
[09-Aug-2013 21:59:38]  <IllFlower> "Look, the back of the lobby doesn't have any windows. Unless the witch has X-ray vision, we can creep in through the back door and get a sneak attack in." Raise 36, leave 39.
[09-Aug-2013 21:59:42]  <IllFlower> **
[09-Aug-2013 22:02:09]  <Hitomi_Yano> hm, i'm thinking of having hitomi be a bit indignant and then probably giving in, but to do that i'll have to "escalate" to involve Heart. Does that make sense?
[09-Aug-2013 22:02:28]  <Hitomi_Yano> although, hm, you only have two dice left.
[09-Aug-2013 22:02:42]  <IllFlower> I'm not sure I follow that first idea.
[09-Aug-2013 22:02:52]  <IllFlower> If you bring in Ht, it's going to be a physical conflict.
[09-Aug-2013 22:02:56]  <Hitomi_Yano> Oh.
[09-Aug-2013 22:03:12]  <Hitomi_Yano> Never mind, hm.
[09-Aug-2013 22:03:14]  <Jun> Challenge him to an arm wrestling match.
[09-Aug-2013 22:03:28]  <IllFlower> Oh, dammit, actually, I think I told you to roll the wrong dice.
[09-Aug-2013 22:03:41]  <IllFlower> I asked you to roll Ac+Wl when it should have been Ac+Ht.
[09-Aug-2013 22:03:43]  <Hitomi_Yano> ?
[09-Aug-2013 22:03:53]  <IllFlower> Whatever, let's go with it.

[09-Aug-2013 22:05:20]  <IllFlower> Hitomi_Yano: Actually, hm. You should have rolled 6d6, not 9d6. We can knock off the last three dice you rolled (235), since you haven't used them. That would leave you with 23.
[09-Aug-2013 22:05:35]  <Hitomi_Yano> pf, okay, that makes things easier for me then.
[09-Aug-2013 22:05:53]  <IllFlower> If you choose to escalate to a physical conflict, you'd roll Bd. I could see her trying to drag Ootani straight through the front door, for instance.
[09-Aug-2013 22:06:00]  <IllFlower> Or you can always give.
[09-Aug-2013 22:06:08]  <Hitomi_Yano> Yeah, goin' with the latter, I Think.

[09-Aug-2013 22:06:43]  <SpruceZeus> okay
[09-Aug-2013 22:07:11]  <Hitomi_Yano> Hitomi makes an irritated expression. What he says makes sense - no reason to give the thing any more tools than it already has hidden away - but dammit, she doesn't need to be taking advice from some kid. She's heard enough stories about what witches can do to groups bigger than the two of them, though.
[09-Aug-2013 22:08:05]  <Hitomi_Yano> "Fine, whatever. You better keep up, though." She breaks into a jog and along a side street, avoiding entering the line of sight of the building's lobby.
[09-Aug-2013 22:08:23]  <SpruceZeus> ponicalica: can you gget me logs later?

[09-Aug-2013 22:09:46]  <Hitomi_Yano> Sorry for being anticlimatic. If it had been more complex-sounding I probably would have escalated but given what was presented there wasn't even enough room for her ego to really flare.
[09-Aug-2013 22:10:52]  <Hitomi_Yano> "As tough as I am I should heed those with actual experience." d6. ?
[09-Aug-2013 22:11:02]  <Hitomi_Yano> actual experience, knowledge, whatever?
[09-Aug-2013 22:11:33]  <Hitomi_Yano> whatever --> experience or knowledge, they kind of go hand in hand but there's no real word for both...?
[09-Aug-2013 22:12:10]  <IllFlower> Hey, there's no need to worry about being climactic before we've even really started.
[09-Aug-2013 22:12:39]  <IllFlower> That sounds like a good idea. "Grudgingly takes advice from those with more experience d6."

[09-Aug-2013 22:14:19]  <Hitomi_Yano> guess it goes without saying that the fight ends successfully. No glass in anyone's magical eyes, in particular.
[09-Aug-2013 22:14:40]  <IllFlower> Yeah, or uneventfully enough that it didn't really affect Hitomi.
[09-Aug-2013 22:14:44]  <Hitomi_Yano> Right right.
[09-Aug-2013 22:15:04]  <Ayako> alright, ready
[09-Aug-2013 22:15:22]  <Ayako> "I hope Ayako deals with a violent situation without collapsing under pressure" or is this too vague?
[09-Aug-2013 22:15:59]  <Ayako> also I don't know if "collapsing under pressure" is the right phrasing.  "collapsing under the reality of the situation"?
[09-Aug-2013 22:16:01]  <IllFlower> No, that works fine. Anything in particular?
[09-Aug-2013 22:16:42]  <Ayako> Um, not that I can think of, no
[09-Aug-2013 22:17:09]  <Hitomi_Yano> Maybe she has to apply her arcane knowledge in some situation wehre someone may get or is being hurt?
[09-Aug-2013 22:17:17]  <IllFlower> Why don't we do something like this...
[09-Aug-2013 22:17:18]  <Hitomi_Yano> knowledge of the arcane*
[09-Aug-2013 22:20:01]  <IllFlower> A massive fight has broken out between civilians under the spell of a witch. Ayako knows a particular ritual that'll get the situation to calm down - let's say drawing a specific rune - but she's under a lot of pressure from the tense situation, and is having difficulty remembering how to perform it.
[09-Aug-2013 22:21:53]  <Ayako> 14okay, that sounds good.  do I start RPing here or wait for you to say more?
[09-Aug-2013 22:22:24]  <IllFlower> Jun: Any input on how I should play this? I have a feeling this is the sort of thing where ponicalica would play Ayako as she is (thus her susceptibility to stress), and I would play the pressure on her to change (the urgency of the situation).
[09-Aug-2013 22:22:44]  <Jun> Yeah, that'd be the way I'd do this.
[09-Aug-2013 22:22:58]  <Jun> The crowd would just be the source of pressure.
[09-Aug-2013 22:23:28]  <IllFlower> Ayako: Okay, roll Ac+Ht.

[09-Aug-2013 22:24:31]  <Ayako> 14I suppose I'd also be able to bring in either "well-read" or "mentor", as well as the notebook?
[09-Aug-2013 22:24:32]  <Hitomi_Yano> well, you have a six.
[09-Aug-2013 22:25:23]  <IllFlower> Ayako: That's interesting, because that's actually the kind of thing that would work *against* you. "Well-read" would mean something like "better able to focus," for instance, which benefits *my* side.
[09-Aug-2013 22:25:43]  <Ayako> 14oh, whoops, misread the conflict
[09-Aug-2013 22:26:03]  <Hitomi_Yano> benefits the crowd?
[09-Aug-2013 22:26:22]  <Hitomi_Yano> oh wait.

[09-Aug-2013 22:26:24]  <IllFlower> Well, the pressure on her to change, except I can't roll additional dice.
[09-Aug-2013 22:26:26]  <Ayako> 14benefits the pressure on her to change
[09-Aug-2013 22:26:50]  <IllFlower> You could pull in your 2d6 relationship with the conservators - you have faith that someone else will fix it if you can't.
[09-Aug-2013 22:26:51]  <Hitomi_Yano> well you don't have to worry too much about /winning/, just being convincing, i guess. though Fallout might be intersting
[09-Aug-2013 22:27:37]  <Ayako> 14ha, I was actually thinking the 1d8, as early insecurities bubbling up.
[09-Aug-2013 22:28:32]  <IllFlower> That could also work. Kind of a flip-side of the relationship.
[09-Aug-2013 22:28:50]  <IllFlower> Or, if you're desperate, you could do both.
[09-Aug-2013 22:29:07]  <Jun> I wouldn't be too concerned about fallout here. As long as you don't start whipping out magical weapons you shouldn't take anything bigger than a d6.

[09-Aug-2013 22:30:22]  <IllFlower> You can go ahead and roll 2d6+d8 in, then.

[09-Aug-2013 22:31:54]  <IllFlower> Something to grab Ayako's attention.
[09-Aug-2013 22:34:47]  <IllFlower> Right, so, Ayako tries to get a sense of what's going on.

[09-Aug-2013 22:39:16]  <IllFlower> Ayako?
[09-Aug-2013 22:39:29]  <Ayako> 14yeah, deciding what to do and how to do it
[09-Aug-2013 22:40:20]  <IllFlower> You can talk it out here if you want.
[09-Aug-2013 22:40:41]  <Ayako> 14like, what should be RPed as a block/dodge, what should be RPed as taking the blow
[09-Aug-2013 22:40:41]  <Hitomi_Yano> I was gonna say, so ponny's playing her desire to stay unsure and stuff. So his moves would be her reasonoing to herself that she can't do it, while yours are going to be indications that she can?
[09-Aug-2013 22:40:54]  <IllFlower> Bah, I'm getting a call. Let me step out for a bit. Won't be more than 20 minutes.
[09-Aug-2013 22:41:29]  <Jun> Yeah, the conflict here is more with that pang than with the guys.
[09-Aug-2013 22:42:40]  *** Jun <~Iverum@99-102-0-211.lightspeed.iplsin.sbcglobal.net> has quit IRC (Quit: gotta run errands)
[09-Aug-2013 22:43:48]  <Ayako> 14and so taking the blow would be admitting to the legitimacy of the worry, while block/dodge would be deflecting it?
[09-Aug-2013 22:44:07]  <Hitomi_Yano> Taking the Blow is, technically, just an indication that you are taking Fallout by not Giving at that point right there.
[09-Aug-2013 22:44:21]  <Hitomi_Yano> It's given that title becuase well, that's how you could/should/may roleplay it.
[09-Aug-2013 22:44:47]  <Ayako> 14wait, what?  I'm going to wait for IllFlower, and dammit why did Rig have to leave right before I asked the question
[09-Aug-2013 22:44:52]  <Hitomi_Yano> Fallout shouldn't be serious at all, though. It's a "best dice out of this group" sort of thing and you won't get anything crazy.
[09-Aug-2013 22:45:15]  <Hitomi_Yano> Taking the Blow is "you use 3+ dice to meet IF's raise"
[09-Aug-2013 22:45:29]  <Ayako> 14I know the mechanics of the situation, I'm trying to tie it to the roleplaying of the situation.
[09-Aug-2013 22:45:32]  <Hitomi_Yano> ah, sorry.
[09-Aug-2013 22:46:39]  <Ayako> 14so of course the dogspecienced people disappear so I can't get an answer. *sigh*
[09-Aug-2013 22:46:47]  <Ayako> 14*dogsperienced
[09-Aug-2013 22:46:54]  <Ayako> 14actually Nitya, you there?
[09-Aug-2013 22:46:59]  <Nitya> 14wha
[09-Aug-2013 22:47:27]  <Nitya> 14i'm moving tomorrow and my parents are getting all... parental, so i might have to drop off
[09-Aug-2013 22:47:29]  <Hitomi_Yano> Ayako: Well, you're playing as hre desire to stay the same Blocking, Parrying, and Blowtaking are just going to be different magnitudes of you successfully resisting for longer.
[09-Aug-2013 22:47:38]  <Hitomi_Yano> her desire*
[09-Aug-2013 22:47:43]  <Hitomi_Yano> the same. Blocking,...*
[09-Aug-2013 22:48:04]  <Ayako> 14you're experienced, can you read over what I've written and tell me if I'm full of shit?
[09-Aug-2013 22:48:20]  <Nitya> 14um, in relation to what
[09-Aug-2013 22:48:48]  <Ayako> 14and Hitomi, the way you're describing it you're saying they should all just be played the same?  That doesn't sit right with me, as I think the thing about Dogs is that the mechanical differences are supposed to imply the roleplaying ones
[09-Aug-2013 22:51:38]  <Ayako> 14also: there's something weirdly unsatisfying in being curbstomped towards personal growth
[09-Aug-2013 22:53:16]  <Hitomi_Yano> Ayako: The same as in they're just different magnitudes. Parrying would be your pressure to change being pairtcularly weak for a moment; Taking the Blow is you doing something ever so slightly dangerous to avoid yielding to the pressure to change; Blocking is somewhere in between.
[09-Aug-2013 22:53:47]  <Hitomi_Yano> You RP according to the text, really. I could have escalated if I really wanted to but RP-wise it didn't make any sense for Hitomi to drag thsi guy into a more dangerousd situation just because of her ego, when he's not being antagonistic.
[09-Aug-2013 22:54:31]  <Ayako> 14eh, what I'm saying is just that the "something ever so slightly dangerous" to me feels like a change in type, not just magnitude
[09-Aug-2013 22:55:07]  <Ayako> 14but with me playing as my insecurities, should it be more hopeful or less hopeful
[09-Aug-2013 22:55:58]  <Hitomi_Yano> Well, Rig's blowtake was "sometimes violence /is/ the answer", temporary. This was because he Took the Blow when in RP he was forced into that judo throw in order to stop the girl from stabbing herself.
[09-Aug-2013 22:56:30]  <Hitomi_Yano> In order to not yield she pushed herself into a slightly different mindset, is how it was played out; but in the end it was still him not having enough dice to continue on normally, kinda thing.
[09-Aug-2013 22:56:36]  <Ayako> 14bah, where's the example of this sort of conflict in the book
[09-Aug-2013 22:57:48]  <Ayako> 14I am frustrated because this is turning out to be 1) uninteresting 2) have a big gap in it due to a damn phone call, when I need help the most, and honestly I don't feel I can trust what you're saying, Barcode
[09-Aug-2013 22:58:11]  <Ayako> 14er, uninteresting's not the right word, but like, it's a foregone conclusion
[09-Aug-2013 22:58:16]  <IllFlower> All right, I'm back. Sorry for the delay.
[09-Aug-2013 22:58:33]  <Hitomi_Yano> Sorry. I'm just working off what I've seen so far. I can take a look around the manual for example conflicts, i guess, though hey he's back.
[09-Aug-2013 22:59:04]  <Hitomi_Yano> Also it's not necessarily a foregone conclusion; part of the RP aspect of the game is that what happens in text can change what's justifiable as going on/not Giving.
[09-Aug-2013 22:59:21]  <Ayako> 14well, there's basically no way IllFlower gives, is what I'm saying
[09-Aug-2013 22:59:38]  <IllFlower> Who knows.
[09-Aug-2013 22:59:48]  <Hitomi_Yano> Keep in mind he cannot Escalate at all; he only has the dice he currently has.
[09-Aug-2013 23:00:04]  <Ayako> 14but yeah, IllFlower, what would be taking the blow vs blockdodging here
[09-Aug-2013 23:00:38]  <IllFlower> In terms of magnitude, a block/dodge would be something like brushing off the additional pressure, considering it something ignorable, distancing herself from the situation.
[09-Aug-2013 23:01:03]  <IllFlower> Taking the blow would be equivalent to being forced to acknowledge the urgency of the situation and thus pressed into action.
[09-Aug-2013 23:01:53]  <IllFlower> *Reversing* the blow would be something like, maybe, "oh, I've seen this before, it's nothing to worry about, there's no reason to get involved."
[09-Aug-2013 23:02:43]  <Ayako> 15:29:00 <@IllFlower> 1111113356.
[09-Aug-2013 23:02:49]  <Ayako> 15:33:04 <@IllFlower> Right, so, Ayako tries to get a sense of what's going on. She looks around and sees two enraged men swinging at each other, gradually moving out from the enclosed courtyard into a nearby 
[09-Aug-2013 23:02:53]  <Ayako>                       street. A pang of worry strikes at her heart: "What if this fight spills out into the open?" Raise 34, leave 123455. **
[09-Aug-2013 23:03:03]  <Ayako> 14this way, I don't have to page up to see what I'm responding to >_>
[09-Aug-2013 23:03:08]  <Hitomi_Yano> oh, the long series of 1s are your dice - oh.
[09-Aug-2013 23:04:45]  * Ayako stares at the fighters, realizing how quickly this could escalate if it brushed some bystander in a bad mood.  See 511; leave 1111336; 3d4 fallout?
[09-Aug-2013 23:05:54]  <IllFlower> Okay, now you have to raise. Some sort of counter-realization, perhaps, or an old fear rising.
[09-Aug-2013 23:10:21]  <Ayako> Her sharp mind, normally taken to the minutiae and principles of the magical world, turns instead on her own psyche.  "This is a magical problem...but not one your, frankly, sheltered self is actually equipped to fix, is it?  You wouldn't be able to intervene in something this nasty."  Raise 33, leave 11116.
[09-Aug-2013 23:11:01]  <Ayako> 14why did I spend so much time thinking up dice scenarios anyways o_O
[09-Aug-2013 23:11:11]  <Ayako> 14this is just ponicalica, the player, overthinking everything >_<
[09-Aug-2013 23:12:56]  <Hitomi_Yano> Haha, yeah, don't worry about specific dice or anything like that. The manual even has numerous instances where it's like "okay this thing didn't happen, instead /this/ happened and then I did this" between a raise and a see
[09-Aug-2013 23:13:18]  <Hitomi_Yano> also, brb, dinner.
[09-Aug-2013 23:13:52]  <IllFlower> Ayako's mind turns. "But isn't that my job? If I can't get involved in magical situations, what in the world *can* I do?" See 24, leave 1355.
[09-Aug-2013 23:15:42]  <IllFlower> She notices that the fight seems to be spilling in her direction, as people begin to get drawn in. "And if I don't do something, I might get hurt too!" Raise 15, leave 35. **
[09-Aug-2013 23:18:02]  <IllFlower> (If you want to escalate this to a physical conflict, one obvious option is to make Ayako lift her legs and run. Just a thought.)
[09-Aug-2013 23:20:36]  <Ayako> 14hmm, if I have the mechanics for reversing the blow right, I suppose I could do that and win the conflict, or artificially have a one and then Give, if I wanted, or artificially escalate and run away...  (sorry for overthinking this)
[09-Aug-2013 23:21:29]  <IllFlower> You can reverse the blow with a 6 and then raise 1(6), yes.
[09-Aug-2013 23:25:34]  <Ayako> 14so the second situation would be the one in which she remembers the relevant rune in the nick of time, correct?  Deliberating on which situation I want to have my character undergo...I'd say this probably shouldn't be this hard, but I think this actually is supposed to be this hard
[09-Aug-2013 23:27:34]  <IllFlower> You can give in conflicts at any point, you don't need to artificially induce anything.
[09-Aug-2013 23:27:46]  <Ayako> 14oh right. >_<
[09-Aug-2013 23:28:12]  <IllFlower> The second situation would be one where the urgency of the situation overrides her anxieties and she manages to steel herself.
[09-Aug-2013 23:28:33]  <IllFlower> "Stop thinking and just *do* it already!" in essence.
[09-Aug-2013 23:30:07]  <Hitomi_Yano>  Sorry, i can't help but talk about things that bug me with my parents which inevitably results in me walking around discussing "whether or not I /really/ have chronic anxiety".
[09-Aug-2013 23:30:14]  <Hitomi_Yano> so. later to come back than i woulda been.
[09-Aug-2013 23:31:51]  <Ayako> "This is a magical problem...it should have a magical solution...I just have to find it!"  Ayako takes a few steps back to avoid getting directly pulled in, and starts flipping through her notebook for something relevant to "quell magically induced violence", which has to be one of the more common runes.  Give.
[09-Aug-2013 23:33:02]  <Ayako> 14and now I suppose all that's left is the 1d6 and the fallout?
[09-Aug-2013 23:33:04]  <Ayako> +roll 3d4
[09-Aug-2013 23:33:04]  <rollermine> Ayako: (4+1+3)=8
[09-Aug-2013 23:33:46]  <IllFlower> All right, that's a 7. You take one short-term fallout effect, as well as the normal d6 trait for initiation.
[09-Aug-2013 23:34:03]  <IllFlower> Fallout effects are on p. 82.
[09-Aug-2013 23:35:30]  <Hitomi_Yano> Not bad, mister calica. It'll get more natural as we go on.
[09-Aug-2013 23:36:01]  *** Ayako <~minakami@2607:f010:2ba:2:21c:25ff:febc:692> has left #madokamadness
[09-Aug-2013 23:36:17]  <ponicalica> I think I just need to not overthink things. :V
[09-Aug-2013 23:36:50]  <Hitomi_Yano> I'm learning that enough as we go on. RPing can work well enough on less rigid structures than i convinced myself were necessary.
[09-Aug-2013 23:37:12]  <Hitomi_Yano> though i guess for me it's more "i want the whole thing planned out" than anything else :v
[09-Aug-2013 23:37:17]  <IllFlower> It never hurts to talk a resolution out.
[09-Aug-2013 23:37:40]  <Hitomi_Yano> oh yeah, and like. i was being so vocal because the whole game's a sorta group effort thing, even if the conflict's only you and the GM.
[09-Aug-2013 23:38:01]  <ponicalica> yeah.  I just wasn't sure about your interpretation of the rules, and lashed out.  sorry4that >_<
[09-Aug-2013 23:38:03]  <IllFlower> This is part of why I don't do that whole nick-swapping thing these days. It enforces too much of a first-person viewpoint.
[09-Aug-2013 23:38:05]  <Hitomi_Yano> it's fine!
[09-Aug-2013 23:38:12]  *** Hitomi_Yano is now known as Barcode
[09-Aug-2013 23:39:00]  <Barcode> Yeah, I'll probably just put the name in brackets or something.
[09-Aug-2013 23:39:10]  <Barcode> The way the manual talks about things you don't really need OOC tags.
[09-Aug-2013 23:39:23]  <Barcode> since you're more narrating what's going on and stuff ,even if it's usualy just narrating your character.
[09-Aug-2013 23:39:58]  <IllFlower> Barcode: You'll notice I was pretty conversational when I was running MB. Such was the influence of Dogs on my GM style.
[09-Aug-2013 23:40:07]  <Barcode> heh.
[09-Aug-2013 23:40:37]  <ponicalica> I feel like for the d4 a good one might be "Gets nervous around crowds", considering the circumstances of the conflict
[09-Aug-2013 23:40:48]  <IllFlower> Sounds good to me.
[09-Aug-2013 23:41:07]  <Barcode> i think players having more control will also help avoid the whole "can I do this/does my character know about this/should i roll for stuffy nostrils today" thing.
[09-Aug-2013 23:41:09]  <ponicalica> (of course I think about that one before I do the d6, which is more important)
[09-Aug-2013 23:41:27]  <IllFlower> Eh, whatever.
[09-Aug-2013 23:41:55]  <Barcode> Take yer time. we're done when you're done anyway.
[09-Aug-2013 23:45:16]  <ponicalica> prone to hesitancy/overthinking?  Don't want to do a slash like that in a Trait (I think; this game is supposed to be permissive of so much that I can never be sure of what's not right) but which one better describes what went down
[09-Aug-2013 23:45:48]  <Barcode> well, you hoped to *checks*
[09-Aug-2013 23:46:30]  <Barcode> "I hope Ayako deals with a violent situation without collapsing under pressure" --> You could, if you don't feel like being creative, just be like "I've learned to stay calm in the midst of violence" 1d6
[09-Aug-2013 23:46:33]  <IllFlower> Her hesitancy eventually succumbed to the immediacy of what was going on, though.
[09-Aug-2013 23:46:59]  <Barcode> or change that description to be more related to immediacy, as IF just described.
[09-Aug-2013 23:47:40]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: true.
[09-Aug-2013 23:47:50]  <IllFlower> So, yeah, what Barcode said would be an idea. Or, if you want to modulate it a bit, something like "doesn't run from violence (which isn't to say she likes being around it) d6."
[09-Aug-2013 23:48:29]  <ponicalica> doesn't run from violence (but doesn't seek it out like Hitomi) 1d6
[09-Aug-2013 23:48:37]  <ponicalica> (no, not actually putting that)
[09-Aug-2013 23:48:38]  <IllFlower> lol
[09-Aug-2013 23:49:13]  <Barcode> heheh
[09-Aug-2013 23:49:19]  <Barcode> "doesn't run from Hitomi"
[09-Aug-2013 23:49:24]  <ponicalica> hehehe
[09-Aug-2013 23:50:47]  <IllFlower> All right, I think we're done for today. I'll get back to you guys about scheduling an actual first session.
[09-Aug-2013 23:50:52]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, you guys.
