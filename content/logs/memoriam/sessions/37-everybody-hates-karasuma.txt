[09-Nov-2014 21:21:12]  <IllFlower> All right, let's get this show on the road.
[09-Nov-2014 21:22:14]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Orlando
[09-Nov-2014 21:22:36]  <Alicia> What.
[09-Nov-2014 21:22:56]  <IllFlower> We left off with the Conservators talking to Miho and Ishigaki.
[09-Nov-2014 21:23:10]  <IllFlower> So we now know where Karasuma might be. What say you all?
[09-Nov-2014 21:23:51]  <BGTB2005> Let's go turn him into paste?
[09-Nov-2014 21:24:29]  <Rig> How about we don't do that.
[09-Nov-2014 21:24:40]  <Alicia> Search him out and see if he's actually been being a big jerk?
[09-Nov-2014 21:24:41]  <ponicalica> let's find him and not turn him into paste unless we absolutely have to
[09-Nov-2014 21:24:54]  <BGTB2005> okay we'll subdue him and then Hikari can handcuff him
[09-Nov-2014 21:24:57]  <Rig> First let's put the idea of paste out of our heads entirely
[09-Nov-2014 21:26:03]  <Alicia> I don't like paste anyway.
[09-Nov-2014 21:27:57]  <Rig> We were going to the arcade, right?
[09-Nov-2014 21:28:10]  <ponicalica> I think so, yeah
[09-Nov-2014 21:28:19]  <ponicalica> Alicia: can't handcuff paste?
[09-Nov-2014 21:28:31]  <Alicia> Sadly, no.
[09-Nov-2014 21:28:38]  <BGTB2005> clearly not trying hard enough
[09-Nov-2014 21:28:53]  <Alicia> I'm making an effort towards improving my Handcuff Game, okay
[09-Nov-2014 21:28:58]  <Alicia> (Her too)
[09-Nov-2014 21:29:00]  <Alicia> ANYWAY
[09-Nov-2014 21:29:06]  <Alicia> Arcade, yes, sounds fine.
[09-Nov-2014 21:30:47]  <IllFlower> All right, let's do that.
[09-Nov-2014 21:31:30]  <IllFlower> The arcade isn't all that busy when the Conservators arrive, but neither is it all that empty.
[09-Nov-2014 21:31:37]  <IllFlower> That being said, the machines are definitely making most of the noise.
[09-Nov-2014 21:32:50]  <IllFlower> A man about Kazuki's age is manning the front desk, looking a little bored.
[09-Nov-2014 21:33:13]  <IllFlower> Karasuma isn't immediately visible, though the place is a bit of a maze.
[09-Nov-2014 21:33:51]  <ponicalica> start looking around for Karasuma?
[09-Nov-2014 21:33:57]  <Rig> Kazuki is about to ask the group if they want to split up to find him, but he catches himself thinking what would happen if Rin found him first.
[09-Nov-2014 21:34:41]  <ponicalica> the arcade would probably end up on fire
[09-Nov-2014 21:34:50]  <Rig> We know what Karasuma looks like, right?
[09-Nov-2014 21:34:53]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[09-Nov-2014 21:34:56]  <Alicia> Several civilian casualties.
[09-Nov-2014 21:34:57]  <BGTB2005> if it helps any, she hasn't met him before so she doesn't know what he looks like
[09-Nov-2014 21:35:21]  <IllFlower> Someone showed you a picture somewhere along the way.
[09-Nov-2014 21:35:34]  <Rig> "Let's see if we can find him," Kazuki says. "And let's stick together."
[09-Nov-2014 21:35:34]  <IllFlower> Or rather, showed Rin.
[09-Nov-2014 21:35:44]  <BGTB2005> she has a vague idea of what he looks like
[09-Nov-2014 21:37:44]  <Rig> Kazuki starts to lead the group down one of the corridors of flashing machines.
[09-Nov-2014 21:37:52]  <IllFlower> As they make their way to the back of the arcade, Hikari notices that one of the service doors is unlocked and slightly ajar. Muffled but distinct sounds of some kind of argument leak through the gap.
[09-Nov-2014 21:39:50]  <Rig> Does Hikari kick down the door and start arresting people?
[09-Nov-2014 21:40:39]  <Alicia> Hikari stops, motioning to the others to listen in.
[09-Nov-2014 21:40:51]  <Alicia> Rig: She's not that bad about it, man
[09-Nov-2014 21:41:57]  <Rig> Kazuki stops and tries to listen over the noise of the games.
[09-Nov-2014 21:42:24]  <ponicalica> Ayako backs up to listen in, behind Hikari
[09-Nov-2014 21:44:02]  <IllFlower> Sorry, making things up on the fly here.
[09-Nov-2014 21:44:20]  <BGTB2005> Rin joins the others, trying to focus on the sounds on the other side of the door
[09-Nov-2014 21:45:49]  <IllFlower> "... the hell you decide to come back for, then?" a male voice shouts.
[09-Nov-2014 21:46:34]  <IllFlower> Then another: "What? You own this arcade or something?"
[09-Nov-2014 21:47:01]  <IllFlower> "You know damn well what you did wrong."
[09-Nov-2014 21:47:34]  <IllFlower> "Yeah. Absolutely nothing. I don't need your permission."
[09-Nov-2014 21:48:38]  <IllFlower> There's a sudden, dull sound of something heavy hitting the wall. Probably a person.
[09-Nov-2014 21:49:57]  <IllFlower> Then the first voice again: "You keep on thinking that.
[09-Nov-2014 21:50:01]  <IllFlower> "Come on, let's go."
[09-Nov-2014 21:50:16]  <IllFlower> The Conservators hear the sound of footsteps approaching the door.
[09-Nov-2014 21:50:38]  <Rig> Kazuki makes to look like he's involved in some game involving jets and explosions.
[09-Nov-2014 21:51:13]  <Rig> He tries to keep the door in his peripheral vision without being too obvious.
[09-Nov-2014 21:51:35]  <ponicalica> Ayako quickly follows Kazuki's lead, though she's probably way worse at convincing people she's actually playing while the demo mode runs
[09-Nov-2014 21:51:36]  <Alicia> Hikari, meanwhile, absentmindedly plays with her phone behind Kazuki.
[09-Nov-2014 21:51:54]  <IllFlower> The door very nearly opens into Rin's face.
[09-Nov-2014 21:52:29]  <Alicia> She tries to take a few pictures while in position, and makes idle chatter with Kazuki.
[09-Nov-2014 21:52:44]  <IllFlower> Two boys come striding out of the back, neither of whom is Karasuma, looking very annoyed.
[09-Nov-2014 21:52:54]  <BGTB2005> Jumping back quickly, Rin attempts to look innocent
[09-Nov-2014 21:53:09]  <IllFlower> Hikari catches a glimpse of someone crumpled against the wall in the corridor beyond before the door shuts.
[09-Nov-2014 21:54:02]  <IllFlower> Rin, for her part, gets a nasty glare from the departing boys.
[09-Nov-2014 21:54:10]  <Rig> We should check on the person when the boys are gone.
[09-Nov-2014 21:54:55]  <ponicalica> yeah
[09-Nov-2014 21:55:00]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[09-Nov-2014 21:55:10]  <IllFlower> "You that desperate?" one of the boys says dismissively.
[09-Nov-2014 21:55:25]  <Alicia> (Agreed.)
[09-Nov-2014 21:56:37]  <IllFlower> Apropos of nothing, you folks should figure out when your characters' birthdays are. Anyway.
[09-Nov-2014 21:56:56]  <BGTB2005> I think I already mentioned when Rin's was?
[09-Nov-2014 21:56:56]  <ponicalica> Has it been a year in-game since we started?  If so, Ayako's probably 17 now
[09-Nov-2014 21:57:20]  <Alicia> Hikari's is on July 16th.
[09-Nov-2014 21:57:24]  <Alicia>  /canon
[09-Nov-2014 21:57:29]  <ponicalica> >July
[09-Nov-2014 21:57:29]  <IllFlower> Somewhere between 7 and 9 months.
[09-Nov-2014 21:57:31]  <ponicalica> >7
[09-Nov-2014 21:57:58]  <IllFlower> ANYWAY LET'S KEEP MOVING SHALL WE
[09-Nov-2014 21:58:46]  <BGTB2005> Rin was born May 1, 1997
[09-Nov-2014 21:59:10]  <ponicalica> mayday
[09-Nov-2014 21:59:56]  <Rig> Shall we check on that person?
[09-Nov-2014 22:00:01]  <BGTB2005> also incidentally three years to the day Ayrton Senna died
[09-Nov-2014 22:00:18]  <Buttercupistiny> illflower derailed this train, man
[09-Nov-2014 22:00:43]  <Rig> Birthdays! Panic.
[09-Nov-2014 22:00:57]  <Alicia> After briefly rummaging through her bag for bandages and such, Hikari whispers to Kazuki about having gotten a few, albeit bad, pictures.
[09-Nov-2014 22:01:00]  <IllFlower> Getting little reaction from Rin, the boys move on, not noticing the other Conservators much at all.
[09-Nov-2014 22:01:18]  <Rig> Thank god, they could have made Ayako cry.
[09-Nov-2014 22:01:20]  <Alicia> Just in case they would need to return to them as well.
[09-Nov-2014 22:01:27]  <Rig> And then it'd be the end for us all.
[09-Nov-2014 22:01:39]  <Alicia> D:
[09-Nov-2014 22:02:07]  <IllFlower> Soon the pair disappears out of sight behind the banks of machines.
[09-Nov-2014 22:03:24]  <Rig> Kazuki tries the door, hoping it is still unlocked.
[09-Nov-2014 22:03:41]  <ponicalica> if it's locked Ayako has a key :p
[09-Nov-2014 22:04:14]  <IllFlower> It's open.
[09-Nov-2014 22:04:57]  <Rig> Hikari should probably rush in first, since she's the one who say the person.
[09-Nov-2014 22:06:05]  <IllFlower> Hikari opens the door to find, as she thought, Karasuma still leaning unsteadily against the wall.
[09-Nov-2014 22:06:27]  <Rig> What a twist!?
[09-Nov-2014 22:06:35]  <IllFlower> Not really.
[09-Nov-2014 22:06:38]  <Rig> I know.
[09-Nov-2014 22:06:55]  <Rig> Anyway, looks like he's been pasted already. Rin's job is done for her.
[09-Nov-2014 22:07:13]  <BGTB2005> next objective: track the two boys down?
[09-Nov-2014 22:07:18]  <IllFlower> I'm having the NPCs corner the market on violence this arc.
[09-Nov-2014 22:07:29]  <Rig> First we should probably figure out what the hell happened to him.
[09-Nov-2014 22:08:36]  <IllFlower> Karasuma looks up to see who's entered. His only reaction to Hikari is a quizzical raising of his eyebrows.
[09-Nov-2014 22:09:26]  <Rig> Kazuki follows close behind, mildly surprised to find their "bully" being served some of his own medicine.
[09-Nov-2014 22:09:55]  <IllFlower> As the other Conservators enter the hallway, Karasuma finally speaks.
[09-Nov-2014 22:10:01]  <IllFlower> "There some kind of party going on here?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:10:15]  <IllFlower> He asks like he doesn't really care about the answer.
[09-Nov-2014 22:10:28]  <ponicalica> "We were here to figure out what...you...were doing."
[09-Nov-2014 22:10:57]  <Alicia> Hikari begins taking out her bandages, ignoring the question. "Where were you hurt?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:10:59]  <IllFlower> "And who the hell are you?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:12:14]  <IllFlower> Might I remind you that having strangers suddenly come in and attend to your wounds is a little weird.
[09-Nov-2014 22:12:20]  <Alicia> "Well, at least you're still lucid..." she mutters.
[09-Nov-2014 22:12:35]  <Alicia> IllFlower: I assumed he got dun wasted? Or is it just a little beat up?
[09-Nov-2014 22:12:50]  <Rig> Shouldn't he recognize most of them?
[09-Nov-2014 22:12:52]  <BGTB2005> didn't he have a run in with Ayako and Hikari before?
[09-Nov-2014 22:13:03]  <Alicia> He could have forgotten.
[09-Nov-2014 22:13:10]  <Rig> True.
[09-Nov-2014 22:13:17]  <BGTB2005> hmm, yeah
[09-Nov-2014 22:13:26]  <ponicalica> also he might've been beat up enough that he can't really tell atm
[09-Nov-2014 22:13:31]  <ponicalica> concussion or something
[09-Nov-2014 22:13:31]  <Alicia> And plus if he's thrashed, figures he'd not immediately recognize - yeah.
[09-Nov-2014 22:13:39]  <IllFlower> He doesn't appear to recognize either of them. I'd wager his mind is elsewhere at the moment.
[09-Nov-2014 22:14:03]  <IllFlower> What I'm trying to say is, goddamn it would it kill you guys to introduce yourselves?
[09-Nov-2014 22:14:14]  <Rig> I did it last session!
[09-Nov-2014 22:14:29]  <Alicia> "That doesn't matter. You're obviously hurt, and I can introduce myself after you're more lucid. Now, where are you hurt?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:14:30]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: if Ayako says her own name the witch comes out (ok not really but)
[09-Nov-2014 22:14:32]  <Rig> Kazuki isn't the girl trying to bandage up every wounded guy she sees.
[09-Nov-2014 22:14:53]  <Alicia> Rig: So I see you would rather we let him bleed out, or pass out.
[09-Nov-2014 22:14:58]  <IllFlower> If you say Ayako's name three times fast into a mirror, a magical girl somewhere loses her head.
[09-Nov-2014 22:15:04]  <Rig> I don't think he was hurt that bad.
[09-Nov-2014 22:15:06]  <IllFlower> He's not actually hurt that badly.
[09-Nov-2014 22:15:22]  <Alicia> Okay then never mind that, guh. Misunderstood what you meant by beat up.
[09-Nov-2014 22:15:41]  <Alicia> Or rather, to what extent. >_>
[09-Nov-2014 22:15:42]  <Rig> See, when most people confront people they don't set them on fire and throw them through six plate glass windows.
[09-Nov-2014 22:15:44]  <IllFlower> Would someone care to explain to Karasuma what's going on?
[09-Nov-2014 22:16:00]  <IllFlower> Because Karasuma is currently very confused and more than a little defensive.
[09-Nov-2014 22:16:00]  <Alicia> Rig: Well, fair
[09-Nov-2014 22:16:15]  <Rig> "We've been looking for you. We're Conservators of the Order," Kazuki says.
[09-Nov-2014 22:16:45]  <Rig> Cue the revelation that Karasuma doesn't know what that means.
[09-Nov-2014 22:17:05]  <Alicia> Cue him assuming we're a bunch of thugs.
[09-Nov-2014 22:17:13]  <Rig> Stunned silence and a split screen shot as each member of the team reacts to that fact that Karasuma has no magic at all anymore.
[09-Nov-2014 22:17:31]  <IllFlower> Karasuma makes an exasperated sound.
[09-Nov-2014 22:17:54]  <IllFlower> "Are you fucking with me?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:18:11]  <Rig> Kazuki pauses, wonder if this is a trick question.
[09-Nov-2014 22:18:13]  <Rig> "No?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:18:21]  <Rig> *wondering
[09-Nov-2014 22:19:12]  <IllFlower> The boy lolls his head backwards, staring at the ceiling.
[09-Nov-2014 22:19:34]  <IllFlower> "What do you want?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:20:59]  <Alicia> Hikari smiles. At least he's being a little helpful. "Kazuki, would you please."she asks, stepping away from him towards the door.
[09-Nov-2014 22:21:32]  <IllFlower> I'm not sure if this really counts as "helpful," but okay.
[09-Nov-2014 22:21:34]  <ponicalica> "Your familiar is worried that you seem to be causing trouble with her other initiates."
[09-Nov-2014 22:21:58]  <Rig> Kazuki steps over to Hikari. "Yeah?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:21:59]  <Alicia> IllFlower: A loose definition of helpful. Considering he's not wailing back at us...
[09-Nov-2014 22:22:18]  <Alicia> Rig: I meant that as in "explain the situation", sorry >_>
[09-Nov-2014 22:22:29]  <IllFlower> Karasuma laughs. "So she sent four of you to corner me in the back hall of an arcade.
[09-Nov-2014 22:22:35]  <IllFlower> "Are you fucking with me?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:23:06]  <Rig> Ah, I misunderstood.
[09-Nov-2014 22:23:20]  <ponicalica> "We weren't expecting to see you in this situation."
[09-Nov-2014 22:23:45]  <Rig> "Besides, I don't think we really did the cornering. That was handed by a third party."
[09-Nov-2014 22:23:51]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: "How do you think I feel?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:24:30]  <IllFlower> Rig: "Oh, so you're here to bat cleanup?"
[09-Nov-2014 22:25:04]  <IllFlower> Karasuma's tone isn't amiable in the least.
[09-Nov-2014 22:25:08]  <Rig> "Here to figure out why we need to clean up your mess." Kazuki says. "Again."
[09-Nov-2014 22:25:26]  <Alicia> Hikari sighs. "Stop avoiding the issue and answer us straight, please."
[09-Nov-2014 22:26:33]  <IllFlower> "I don't have any answers for you."
[09-Nov-2014 22:26:53]  <IllFlower> Karasuma turns and starts heading for the back exit on the other end of the corridor.
[09-Nov-2014 22:27:20]  <IllFlower> Well, if anyone wants to initiate a conflict...
[09-Nov-2014 22:27:22]  <Rig> "Not even going to deny it then?" Kazuki calls after him.
[09-Nov-2014 22:27:45]  <Alicia> "Rin... could you go up top and find him, please? He's trying to get away, again."
[09-Nov-2014 22:27:51]  <Rig> Yeah, I'll start a conflict. Talking.
[09-Nov-2014 22:27:58]  <IllFlower> Stakes?
[09-Nov-2014 22:28:05]  <Rig> But he seems disinterested in talking, so, we'll see how that goes.
[09-Nov-2014 22:28:06]  <IllFlower> Alicia: He's not really running. More kinda shambling.
[09-Nov-2014 22:28:19]  <Alicia> Shambling, running, same difference.
[09-Nov-2014 22:28:21]  <Rig> Stakes should be something like "he tells us what he's into"
[09-Nov-2014 22:28:36]  <BGTB2005> plus it's a corridor, Rin can just chase and tackle him
[09-Nov-2014 22:28:47]  <IllFlower> Rig: Just explain what happened with the other two, maybe.
[09-Nov-2014 22:28:56]  <Rig> Yeah, I'd be okay with that.
[09-Nov-2014 22:28:58]  <IllFlower> Okay.
[09-Nov-2014 22:29:19]  <ponicalica> Yeah, that works for me
[09-Nov-2014 22:29:22]  <IllFlower> So Kazuki against Karasuma. Let me roll up Karasuma's character.

[09-Nov-2014 22:32:19]  <IllFlower> Rig: You can raise with that last comment. Just need dice.
[09-Nov-2014 22:32:27]  <Rig> That's what I wanted to do. :P
[09-Nov-2014 22:32:33]  <IllFlower> Good, good.
[09-Nov-2014 22:32:38]  <Rig> @dice use 4 3

[09-Nov-2014 22:33:20]  <IllFlower> Karasuma ignores the question.
[09-Nov-2014 22:33:23]  <IllFlower> @dice use 3 4
[09-Nov-2014 22:33:23]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Used 3 4 = 7. Bank now has 3 4 5 5 6 = 23.
[09-Nov-2014 22:33:37]  <Rig> An excellent see.
[09-Nov-2014 22:36:18]  <IllFlower> Instead, he turns around and tries to provoke Kazuki. "You really just want to hit me, don't you? Nobody talks. Come on." He weakly extends both arms out to his sides. "You know you want to."
[09-Nov-2014 22:36:59]  <IllFlower> I'm going to assign 1d8 to... how would you phrase this.
[09-Nov-2014 22:37:09]  <Rig> Provocateur

[09-Nov-2014 22:49:37]  <IllFlower> (I've discovered listening to the Prodigy is always a great way to tap into ungrounded aggression.)
[09-Nov-2014 22:51:27]  <Rig> "Look, you want honesty? I want to get to the bottom of this. I want to know why you're accused to bullying initiates. I want to know why you're getting beat up in the back room of some shitty arcade." Kazuki sighs. "I really don't want to have another pointless showdown with between people who are pretending they have nothing to lose. So, you can spill your story, or you can walk away. I won't fight you."
[09-Nov-2014 22:51:28]  <IllFlower> I was going to say that Karasuma would almost certainly lose a fistfight if you wanted to make it that, but I noticed that Kazuki has by far the fewest dice in those stats out of the party. Oops.

[09-Nov-2014 22:57:33]  <Rig> Good point.

[09-Nov-2014 23:28:21]  <IllFlower> Well, I mean, there's that whole magical thing that nobody's asked about yet.
[09-Nov-2014 23:28:32]  <IllFlower> And Ayako and Hikari have for whatever reason not mentioned that they know him.
[09-Nov-2014 23:28:37]  <Rig> I've been trying to.
[09-Nov-2014 23:29:45]  <IllFlower> Let's jump track to Kazuki's earlier question, then.
[09-Nov-2014 23:30:13]  <IllFlower> "No. It's because they all hate my guts."
[09-Nov-2014 23:30:48]  <Rig> "I don't think I follow."
[09-Nov-2014 23:31:12]  <ponicalica> "Is it because you were in the 'three souls' cult?"
[09-Nov-2014 23:31:14]  <IllFlower> "You talked to people, right?"
[09-Nov-2014 23:31:40]  <IllFlower> Karasuma twists his lips. "Who'd you talk to?"
[09-Nov-2014 23:32:30]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: I'll table that question and come back to it at an appropriate point.
[09-Nov-2014 23:32:36]  <ponicalica> is any of this supposed to follow from Ayako's comm--ok
[09-Nov-2014 23:33:32]  <Rig> "We talked to Ishigaki. He had some nasty cuts that he attributed to you."
[09-Nov-2014 23:34:13]  <IllFlower> "Yup, hates me. Anyone else?"
[09-Nov-2014 23:34:56]  <Rig> "You didn't give him those cuts then?"
[09-Nov-2014 23:35:11]  <ponicalica> Alicia should probably mention Miho too
[09-Nov-2014 23:36:00]  <IllFlower> Rig: "I did," Karasuma says, visibly short on patience. "Can you answer the question?"
[09-Nov-2014 23:37:14]  <ponicalica> "There was the older one...Miho, I think.  Hikari had a longer conversation with her."
[09-Nov-2014 23:37:24]  <Rig> Kazuki sighs. The guy is strikingly unstable. It reminds him of some people.
[09-Nov-2014 23:38:05]  <IllFlower> Karasuma laughs bitterly. "She *definitely* hates me."
[09-Nov-2014 23:38:20]  <Rig> "Okay, so why are you harassing them?
[09-Nov-2014 23:38:22]  <Rig> "
[09-Nov-2014 23:38:22]  <IllFlower> Okay, bringing ponicalica's question back.
[09-Nov-2014 23:39:40]  <IllFlower> "You know about all that?"
[09-Nov-2014 23:39:50]  <Alicia> Hikari's brought back from her idle thoughts at the mention of Miho, flashing a look in Ayako's direction. "Yes... and she surely has her reasons, too. Said some things about you trying to get your own posse... though now it's hard to see how."
[09-Nov-2014 23:41:43]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Tabling that.
[09-Nov-2014 23:41:56]  <Alicia> Aight.
[09-Nov-2014 23:42:06]  <Rig> Maybe you guys should figure out why he doesn't remember you?
[09-Nov-2014 23:42:31]  <ponicalica> "I was the one who stopped Satsuki Osada.  And you, when you were attacking Mai's protection spell."
[09-Nov-2014 23:44:01]  <IllFlower> Karasuma blinks.
[09-Nov-2014 23:44:37]  <IllFlower> He whispers something inevitably profane to himself.
[09-Nov-2014 23:44:50]  <Alicia> Hikari glares at him.

[09-Nov-2014 23:51:00]  <IllFlower> "Then I get them back, and what happens? I have a different familiar, I'm surrounded by people who don't even think I should be touching a toy wand, and I can't even talk to a girl.

[09-Nov-2014 23:58:44]  <ponicalica> he did try to kill people
[09-Nov-2014 23:58:45]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[09-Nov-2014 23:59:09]  <Rig> Yeah, before, but this is a different case.
[10-Nov-2014 00:00:27]  <Rig> I think we need to address the underlying causes here.
[10-Nov-2014 00:01:14]  <Rig> Which appears to be with the other initiates as much as Karasuma.
[10-Nov-2014 00:01:34]  <Alicia> Something is wrong with the team as a whole, yeah.
[10-Nov-2014 00:01:44]  <Rig> Team therapy!

[10-Nov-2014 00:02:36]  <Rig> I think we need to get this team together and talk through the problems they're having.
[10-Nov-2014 00:02:49]  <BGTB2005> which one
[10-Nov-2014 00:02:54]  <Alicia> Yes.
[10-Nov-2014 00:03:08]  <Rig> We'll use their team as a metaphor.
[10-Nov-2014 00:03:38]  <IllFlower> Hahaha.
[10-Nov-2014 00:04:16]  <IllFlower> Anyway, so what's doing?
[10-Nov-2014 00:05:19]  <Rig> "Karasuma, how about we get your team together and work through this?"
[10-Nov-2014 00:07:27]  <Rig> "What they've done isn't right, but you can't fix it with violence."
[10-Nov-2014 00:07:48]  <IllFlower> "Talking hasn't done us much good, either."
[10-Nov-2014 00:08:37]  <Rig> "Maybe they'll listen if you have us."
[10-Nov-2014 00:08:39]  <IllFlower> ("So you want us to beat you down, then?")
[10-Nov-2014 00:09:08]  <Rig> (Not that Miho will listen.)
[10-Nov-2014 00:09:08]  <IllFlower> Karasuma looks skeptically at Kazuki for a moment.
[10-Nov-2014 00:09:48]  <IllFlower> "Fine," he finally says. "Let's go."
[10-Nov-2014 00:10:16]  <Rig> Kazuki smiles. For once they might solve a case without having to send someone to the hospital.
[10-Nov-2014 00:10:30]  <IllFlower> Everything's coming up roses!
[10-Nov-2014 00:10:31]  <ponicalica> Ayako whispers to Rig.  "You know this will be an uphill battle, right?  His cult did end up killing Jun..."
[10-Nov-2014 00:10:34]  <ponicalica> er
[10-Nov-2014 00:10:36]  <ponicalica> to Kazuki
[10-Nov-2014 00:10:57]  <Alicia> "Good." Hikari responds shortly, with a small smile. Karasuma's troublesome, but at least he's following along so far.
[10-Nov-2014 00:11:04]  <IllFlower> How much does Kazuki know about Jun?
[10-Nov-2014 00:11:31]  <Rig> Kazuki responds quietly, "I've been learning that doing the right thing is always an uphill battle."
[10-Nov-2014 00:11:41]  <IllFlower> Deep, man.
[10-Nov-2014 00:11:54]  <Rig> Gotta be as anime as possible.
[10-Nov-2014 00:11:57]  <Alicia> Is that.............. actually not a job?
[10-Nov-2014 00:12:04]  <Alicia> ja
[10-Nov-2014 00:12:10]  <Alicia> :|
[10-Nov-2014 00:12:21]  <IllFlower> "Dey took our jerbs!"
[10-Nov-2014 00:12:37]  <Alicia> lol.
[10-Nov-2014 00:13:21]  <IllFlower> So what's the plan? We can leave off here and pick up next time, or get everyone on the couch.
[10-Nov-2014 00:13:44]  <ponicalica> This is a decent stopping point if everyone wants to stop.  I'm fine either way
[10-Nov-2014 00:14:03]  <Rig> I'm good with stopping here. My girlfriend wants me to come over and has been asking me since before we started.
[10-Nov-2014 00:14:21]  <IllFlower> Haha, okay. Can you do fallout before you go?
[10-Nov-2014 00:14:23]  <Alicia> I'm fine here. Glad that we weren't the ones who attacked Karasuma.
[10-Nov-2014 00:14:24]  <BGTB2005> either way's fine here
[10-Nov-2014 00:15:01]  <Rig> Yeah, I can do that.
[10-Nov-2014 00:15:33]  <Rig> I was thinking I'd roll "Picks his battles" down by one die, but raise the d-size.
[10-Nov-2014 00:16:35]  <IllFlower> So 1d8?
[10-Nov-2014 00:17:06]  <Rig> Yeah. How do you feel about that?
[10-Nov-2014 00:17:08]  <IllFlower> That's a nicely nuanced way to do it. It's got my approval.
[10-Nov-2014 00:17:23]  <Rig> Yeah, I think that shows what he got out of that conflict.
[10-Nov-2014 00:17:47]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@182.55.189.100> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Nov-2014 00:18:14]  <IllFlower> Then 1d8 it is.
[10-Nov-2014 00:18:33]  <IllFlower> Okay, thanks for playing, everyone. Until next time.
[10-Nov-2014 00:19:08]  <Alicia> \o/
