[20-Jul-2014 20:18:37]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: "It's a puppy!" | UA: Let's go back to haranguing Nitya
[20-Jul-2014 20:19:10]  <IllFlower> So before we dive in, a program note...
[20-Jul-2014 20:19:57]  <IllFlower> In order to spare us all from having to remember another name, I'm arbitrarily moving everything that happened last session to Kikugawa, a.k.a. the town we've always been in.
[20-Jul-2014 20:20:12]  <Alicia> Mkay.
[20-Jul-2014 20:20:20]  <IllFlower> I recall everyone was planning on following Yuuya, our celebrity of the moment, back to his hometown.
[20-Jul-2014 20:20:26]  <IllFlower> We'll let that be Miyahama.
[20-Jul-2014 20:20:36]  <IllFlower> That's all. Any questions?
[20-Jul-2014 20:20:45]  <Rig> Good. That means one less name I have to look up everytime I want to remember what I’m talking about/to
[20-Jul-2014 20:21:01]  <IllFlower> I hope you've been keeping notes.
[20-Jul-2014 20:21:40]  <IllFlower> ("Yuuya: GODDAMMIT ILLFLOWER JUST CALL HIM BOB")
[20-Jul-2014 20:21:55]  <Nitya> that fucker. there he is. god, what a tool.
[20-Jul-2014 20:22:29]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[20-Jul-2014 20:23:00]  <IllFlower> So what's the plan? Getting off the train and stumbling around randomly would be funny but ineffectual.
[20-Jul-2014 20:24:01]  <Alicia> Good point.
[20-Jul-2014 20:24:16]  <ponicalica> Well, what's our goal, again?  To find out more about the attacks, right?
[20-Jul-2014 20:24:31]  <BGTB2005> think so
[20-Jul-2014 20:24:41]  <IllFlower> Don't ask me. They're *your* objectives. :p
[20-Jul-2014 20:24:59]  <ponicalica> I was asking the other players
[20-Jul-2014 20:25:09]  <Rig> Kazuki’s objective is to become prophet.
[20-Jul-2014 20:25:36]  <ponicalica> ("he wants to crash the confirmation and get the prophetship himself")
[20-Jul-2014 20:25:56]  <Rig> But in the short term we were trying to figure out who would fake a witch about a rumor of Kotomi.
[20-Jul-2014 20:26:04]  <IllFlower> He's going to kill Yuuya and wear his body to the confirmation.
[20-Jul-2014 20:26:34]  <IllFlower> It's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, except not.
[20-Jul-2014 20:26:45]  <Rig> Misread not as “hot”
[20-Jul-2014 20:26:52]  <Rig> Was confused about IllFlower’s kinks.
[20-Jul-2014 20:27:01]  <IllFlower> Are you JackMackerel?
[20-Jul-2014 20:27:31]  <Rig> I get really into roleplaying.
[20-Jul-2014 20:27:52]  <Alicia> ...
[20-Jul-2014 20:28:49]  <Alicia> Maybe we should go harangue those involved in the prophetship. No...
[20-Jul-2014 20:28:52]  <IllFlower> Well, in any case, there's Yuuya, his familiar, Mukai... lots of options.
[20-Jul-2014 20:29:16]  <Rig> Let’s talk to his familiar!
[20-Jul-2014 20:30:09]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[20-Jul-2014 20:30:32]  <IllFlower> Sure, why not.
[20-Jul-2014 20:30:33]  <BGTB2005> ask if Mukai knows if anyone wanted Yuuya dead?
[20-Jul-2014 20:31:10]  <Rig> Well, the attacks seem to be following Yuuya.
[20-Jul-2014 20:31:18]  <Rig> Let’s see if he has any info on it.
[20-Jul-2014 20:31:27]  <Alicia> See who would want to. Affiliations and whatnot.
[20-Jul-2014 20:31:35]  <IllFlower> So who are we seeing?
[20-Jul-2014 20:31:42]  <Alicia> I mean, someone has something out for him.
[20-Jul-2014 20:31:49]  <Alicia> Mukai I think.
[20-Jul-2014 20:32:18]  <IllFlower> I remember you guys wanted to arrange security anyway...
[20-Jul-2014 20:33:03]  <ponicalica> Yeah.  So talking to Mukai about the threat on Yuuya's life is probably the best idea for now
[20-Jul-2014 20:33:34]  <IllFlower> Then off we go.
[20-Jul-2014 20:35:20]  <IllFlower> After defeating the bridge witch, the Conservators make arrangements to meet Yuuya's sponsor Mukai in Miyahama, who elects to meet them in a plaza near the shopping district.
[20-Jul-2014 20:36:43]  <IllFlower> The place is, unsurprisingly, fairly crowded, and scarcely anyone pays any heed to the group as they make their way over to an umbrella-covered table where Mukai is waiting.
[20-Jul-2014 20:37:51]  <IllFlower> She's dressed remarkably casually for a prophet, funnily enough.
[20-Jul-2014 20:38:32]  <IllFlower> Ayako recognizes her as Yurika. So it *was* that Mukai.
[20-Jul-2014 20:39:22]  <IllFlower> "One, two, three... oh, if it isn't Ayako!" she says, as they all take their seats.
[20-Jul-2014 20:39:56]  <IllFlower> "So you're a Conservator now? Good, good, good." She nods to herself in satisfaction.
[20-Jul-2014 20:40:33]  <IllFlower> "What's the story? You wanted to talk to me about Kinomoto, right?"
[20-Jul-2014 20:41:35]  <ponicalica> "Mmhmm.  We believe he's being targeted."
[20-Jul-2014 20:44:07]  <IllFlower> "By Kotomi Taniguchi, right?" Yurika asks. She seems unperturbed by the idea.
[20-Jul-2014 20:46:13]  <Alicia> "She's our only lead so far. I take it you're familiar with her?"
[20-Jul-2014 20:47:07]  <IllFlower> "Something like that. I wouldn't be doing my job if I weren't.
[20-Jul-2014 20:47:33]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@198.13.197.53> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[20-Jul-2014 20:47:47]  <IllFlower> "It seems fishy, though. The evidence doesn't point to her so much as vaguely gesture."
[20-Jul-2014 20:48:21]  <ponicalica> "The remnants were also...strange.  Didn't quite feel the same as Kotomi did."
[20-Jul-2014 20:49:32]  <IllFlower> "Feel? You know what she feels like?"
[20-Jul-2014 20:49:46]  <IllFlower> It's an odd question, but Yurika asks it with an entirely straight face.
[20-Jul-2014 20:50:19]  <ponicalica> Okay, that sounded more like innuendo than I was expecting.
[20-Jul-2014 20:51:11]  <IllFlower> <age years="5">You started it!</age>
[20-Jul-2014 20:52:48]  <IllFlower> Should I ask a different question?
[20-Jul-2014 20:52:52]  <ponicalica> Ayako's facade cracks a bit; it's obvious what she's thinking about now.  "I...was one of the Conservators there when she escaped.  The other two..."
[20-Jul-2014 20:53:09]  <ponicalica> nah, I was just trying to think of the best way to say that sentence.
[20-Jul-2014 20:53:36]  <IllFlower> "Ah..." Yurika shakes her head.
[20-Jul-2014 20:55:02]  <IllFlower> She goes silent for a moment.
[20-Jul-2014 20:55:32]  <IllFlower> "Anyway.
[20-Jul-2014 20:56:17]  <IllFlower> "I'm concerned, but right now it doesn't seem like there's enough to go on to be anything beyond that.
[20-Jul-2014 20:56:54]  <IllFlower> "As far as things go, I'm more worried about what Kinomoto might do to his own chances."
[20-Jul-2014 20:57:08]  <IllFlower> Yurika sighs. "He's not exactly great with advice."
[20-Jul-2014 20:57:10]  <ponicalica> "He had some relation to Kotomi, didn't he?"
[20-Jul-2014 20:58:49]  <IllFlower> "Yeah, but according to him it was mostly just acquaintance.
[20-Jul-2014 20:59:14]  <IllFlower> "And, well, it's not like I can ask Taniguchi for a second opinion."
[20-Jul-2014 21:03:11]  <ponicalica> "And not great with advice?  Do you think he'll endanger himself?"
[20-Jul-2014 21:04:50]  <IllFlower> "Let's say he's not exactly the patient type," Yurika says.
[20-Jul-2014 21:05:39]  <IllFlower> "Sometimes he has some trouble keeping his temper in check.
[20-Jul-2014 21:06:04]  <IllFlower> "You remember the 'three wishes' cult that sprang up a few months ago, right?"
[20-Jul-2014 21:06:18]  <IllFlower> s/three wishes/three souls/
[20-Jul-2014 21:07:51]  <ponicalica> Ayako turns to Hikari; partially for reassurance, partially to hide what's happening to her expression at least a little bit from Yurika.
[20-Jul-2014 21:08:23]  <IllFlower> This just isn't Ayako's day.
[20-Jul-2014 21:08:42]  <ponicalica> ("Juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun! ;_;")
[20-Jul-2014 21:08:48]  <IllFlower> lol.
[20-Jul-2014 21:09:06]  <IllFlower> Kazuki probably has some background knowledge of the case as well, if he wants to chip in.
[20-Jul-2014 21:09:11]  <IllFlower> He seems to have a lot of background knowledge.
[20-Jul-2014 21:09:34]  <Alicia> Hikari looks to Ayako then turns Mukai. "We're fairly familiar with the cult..."
[20-Jul-2014 21:10:07]  <Alicia> (Yeah he does.)
[20-Jul-2014 21:10:16]  <Rig> Kazuki is busy stewing about his friend getting to be a prophet despite his anger issues.
[20-Jul-2014 21:10:50]  <BGTB2005> "I can't really say I've run across them before."
[20-Jul-2014 21:12:37]  <IllFlower> What happened to being unbroken and cheerful?
[20-Jul-2014 21:13:27]  <Rig> Not actually stewing. Just don’t have a lot to add.
[20-Jul-2014 21:13:36]  <ponicalica> You can be unbroken and cheerful while still being completely jealous
[20-Jul-2014 21:14:29]  <IllFlower> "Kinomoto was busy wishing poxes on both their houses," Yurika explains.
[20-Jul-2014 21:16:11]  <IllFlower> "The ringleader got her punishment, but he was never quite happy with how the one paying off her comrades -- what was her name again? Fukada? -- got a slap on the wrist.
[20-Jul-2014 21:17:27]  <IllFlower> "He's gotten a few murmurs of agreement from rather looser cannons. I've been trying to discourage him from sticking his neck out too far on the subject so he doesn't get caught up in anything, but he has his confidence that he won't."
[20-Jul-2014 21:17:54]  <IllFlower> Yurika rolls her eyes. "He's still young. Can't do much about that."
[20-Jul-2014 21:18:17]  <ponicalica> if Kazuki is stewing, maybe this is the time he should file a complaint ;)
[20-Jul-2014 21:20:00]  <Rig> My dog is an idiot and I have to go rescue him from under the house.
[20-Jul-2014 21:20:02]  <Rig> Sorry.
[20-Jul-2014 21:20:16]  <Alicia> Bark bark.
[20-Jul-2014 21:24:49]  <IllFlower> Well, uh...

[20-Jul-2014 21:55:02]  <ponicalica> awesome
[20-Jul-2014 21:55:41]  <IllFlower> Glad that went all right.
[20-Jul-2014 21:56:10]  <IllFlower> Shall we resume? Yurika just dropped a bunch of information last we left off.
[20-Jul-2014 21:56:17]  <ponicalica> I'm ready
[20-Jul-2014 21:56:21]  <Rig> Did I miss anything when I pinged out?
[20-Jul-2014 21:56:24]  <IllFlower> Nope.
[20-Jul-2014 21:56:30]  <Rig> Cool.
[20-Jul-2014 21:56:40]  <IllFlower> Mostly us making jokes about dogs getting in trouble during emdogs.
[20-Jul-2014 21:56:52]  <Rig> “Why are you sponsoring Kinomoto if you’re so unsure about him?” Kazuki asks.
[20-Jul-2014 21:57:35]  <IllFlower> "Nobody's perfect," Yurika says.
[20-Jul-2014 21:59:01]  <Rig> “Still, it seems like he’s got his own demons to fight still before he should accept prophetship[?].” 
[20-Jul-2014 21:59:32]  <Alicia> ("I, however...")
[20-Jul-2014 22:00:05]  <Rig> “Perhaps some of these demons are trying to keep him from accepting?”
[20-Jul-2014 22:00:40]  <IllFlower> "Of course. I figure it's better to have that goal in front of him, though. He'll have a better chance at working things out if he's got something motivating him.
[20-Jul-2014 22:01:57]  <IllFlower> "Plus he's incredibly technically proficient. I don't know about you, but I think it'd be a waste to let him go. He's got the perfect story, going from having no magical background to speak of to having a shot at becoming a prophet at his age."
[20-Jul-2014 22:02:17]  <ponicalica> Sick burn.
[20-Jul-2014 22:02:49]  <Rig> “A prophet for the people,” Kazuki mutters.
[20-Jul-2014 22:03:02]  <IllFlower> I suspect Kazuki's going to get a lot of nerves touched during this branch.
[20-Jul-2014 22:03:08]  <IllFlower> `_`
[20-Jul-2014 22:03:14]  <Rig> <Didn’t realize we were running a PR firm,> he thinks to himself.
[20-Jul-2014 22:03:48]  <IllFlower> lol, that's not how I meant it.
[20-Jul-2014 22:04:03]  <ponicalica> "At any rate, do you know if Fukuda's...associates are aware of his vendetta?  At the very least, it's worth a look."
[20-Jul-2014 22:06:15]  <IllFlower> "No. I doubt Kinomoto would do anything to them himself. He's not stupid enough to do that.
[20-Jul-2014 22:06:36]  <IllFlower> "What I'm concerned about is that he'll say the wrong things to the wrong people."
[20-Jul-2014 22:09:06]  <Rig> Quick recap/question: She knows that Kinomoto is being targetted, yes? Or she thinks he isn't?
[20-Jul-2014 22:09:51]  <IllFlower> She's not convinced there's enough of a pattern yet.

[20-Jul-2014 22:11:53]  <ponicalica> ?
[20-Jul-2014 22:12:11]  <Alicia> I was actually gonna offer up the idea of being bodyguards earlier, but forgot. :V
[20-Jul-2014 22:12:14]  <Alicia> So yeah.
[20-Jul-2014 22:12:16]  <BGTB2005> I think so
[20-Jul-2014 22:12:27]  <Alicia> Well, bodyguard =/= security but...
[20-Jul-2014 22:13:48]  <Rig> Kazuki decides to broach a new subject, “I know that we’re not allowed to be involved in Kinomoto’s ceremonies, but we’d like to be assigned as a security detail to prevent any attempts on Kinomoto.”
[20-Jul-2014 22:14:38]  <IllFlower> Yurika thinks for a moment.
[20-Jul-2014 22:15:05]  <IllFlower> "For his protection, or for other reasons?"
[20-Jul-2014 22:17:05]  <Rig> “Does it have to be exclusive?”
[20-Jul-2014 22:18:03]  <IllFlower> Yurika smiles at Kazuki's answer. "No, of course not."
[20-Jul-2014 22:19:45]  <IllFlower> Then, "Well, you have my permission. You should discuss this with Kinomoto himself, obviously. And perhaps with his familiar, Masakichi, though you're not obligated to do so."
[20-Jul-2014 22:20:34]  <ponicalica> "Of course.  Thank you for hearing out our concerns."
[20-Jul-2014 22:20:58]  <Rig> Kazuki smiles, “Thank you.”
[20-Jul-2014 22:21:16]  <Alicia> "It's much appreciated."

[20-Jul-2014 22:21:40]  <IllFlower> "You're welcome. Let me know if you nee--"
[20-Jul-2014 22:22:27]  <IllFlower> The opening bars of an old pop song cut Yurika off.
[20-Jul-2014 22:22:33]  <IllFlower> "Sorry, just a second..."
[20-Jul-2014 22:23:11]  <IllFlower> She retrieves her cell phone. "Hello?
[20-Jul-2014 22:23:59]  <IllFlower> "... you're kidding." The color begins to drain from her face.
[20-Jul-2014 22:24:11]  <IllFlower> "Yes, they're here with me. Yes.

[20-Jul-2014 22:24:37]  <IllFlower> "... okay, I'll be there as soon as I can. I'll tell the Conservators."
[20-Jul-2014 22:24:42]  <IllFlower> Click.
[20-Jul-2014 22:24:46]  <ponicalica> (Hitomi turned into a witch and is attacking Yuuya.)
[20-Jul-2014 22:25:48]  <Rig> Hitomi is beating up Yuuya just because.
[20-Jul-2014 22:26:04]  <IllFlower> "There was another attack just outside the Library."
[20-Jul-2014 22:26:45]  <IllFlower> Yurika shakes her head. "That's supposed to be a protected perimeter."

[20-Jul-2014 22:27:12]  <BGTB2005> will be back as soon as possible
[20-Jul-2014 22:28:06]  <IllFlower> Okay. Do you mind if I keep running through this scene? You should be able to catch up by scrolling. We won't move on to the next one until you've had a chance to ask any questions you might have.
[20-Jul-2014 22:29:23]  <ponicalica> probably a good idea
[20-Jul-2014 22:29:50]  <IllFlower> (stock reaction frame: D:|D:|D8|D:)
[20-Jul-2014 22:30:01]  <ponicalica> basically

[20-Jul-2014 22:30:56]  <IllFlower> Remember how we forgot to draw Ayako's glasses last time? Yeah.
[20-Jul-2014 22:31:33]  <Rig> ponicalica: Of course. 
[20-Jul-2014 22:32:58]  <IllFlower> Anyway: "They said you might be familiar with the girl who was attacked. Shirakawa?"
[20-Jul-2014 22:33:09]  * Rig refers to his notes.
[20-Jul-2014 22:34:32]  <Rig> Yeah, I’m not sure who that is.
[20-Jul-2014 22:34:32]  <IllFlower> Alicia and ponicalica ought to know, hint hint.
[20-Jul-2014 22:34:38]  <ponicalica> Ayako nods.  "She was one of Kotomi's followers.
[20-Jul-2014 22:36:49]  <Rig> “One of Kotomi’s followers was attacked? Why?”
[20-Jul-2014 22:37:11]  <Rig> Kazuki doesn’t actually expect an answer.
[20-Jul-2014 22:37:22]  <IllFlower> Yurika doesn't provide one.
[20-Jul-2014 22:37:53]  <IllFlower> "I'm more concerned about how a witch managed to strike so close to the Library."
[20-Jul-2014 22:38:36]  <ponicalica> "Are we sure it was a witch?"
[20-Jul-2014 22:39:42]  <IllFlower> "Pretty sure."
[20-Jul-2014 22:40:03]  <Rig> “We should investigate."
[20-Jul-2014 22:41:24]  <IllFlower> Lots of things needing investigation here.
[20-Jul-2014 22:41:47]  <IllFlower> ("THEN GIVE US SOME ANSWERS ALREADY")
[20-Jul-2014 22:42:23]  <IllFlower> "I agree. This is going to have to take priority.
[20-Jul-2014 22:42:45]  <IllFlower> "The four of you should be on your way. We can discuss Kinomoto's case again later.
[20-Jul-2014 22:42:51]  <BGTB2005> back
[20-Jul-2014 22:43:00]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: any questions?
[20-Jul-2014 22:43:19]  <IllFlower> "Oh, and Ayako?"
[20-Jul-2014 22:43:34]  <ponicalica> "Yes?"
[20-Jul-2014 22:43:36]  <BGTB2005> no questions here
[20-Jul-2014 22:43:51]  <IllFlower> "Don't blind yourself, okay?" Yurika smiles.
[20-Jul-2014 22:45:27]  <ponicalica> Ayako smiles and nods.
[20-Jul-2014 22:47:18]  <ponicalica> Jump to the Library?
[20-Jul-2014 22:47:50]  <IllFlower> It's another train ride back to Kikugawa. The crowds are as blissfully ignorant as ever, doing their best at getting in the way as the Conservators rush to the station.
[20-Jul-2014 22:48:16]  <ponicalica> ("Don't they know we have important Conservator business to get to?" "They don't even know what a Conservator is.")
[20-Jul-2014 22:48:23]  <IllFlower> Turnstile, staircase, platform, sliding door, train car, departure bell, cla-clack-cla-clack...
[20-Jul-2014 22:48:39]  <BGTB2005> ("Screw this I'm flying.")
[20-Jul-2014 22:49:38]  <IllFlower> A bored Hikari stares out of the window as the train rushes down the elevated track out of Miyahama.
[20-Jul-2014 22:50:54]  <IllFlower> Apartment block after apartment block passes by. Windows, clotheslines, sat dishes, magical barriers...
[20-Jul-2014 22:51:23]  <IllFlower> Wait.
[20-Jul-2014 22:52:34]  <IllFlower> Hikari throws her face against the window in order to get a better look before the building goes completely out of sight. But it's futile; the barrier is nowhere to be seen anymore.
[20-Jul-2014 22:53:34]  <IllFlower> Cla-clack-cla-clack...
[20-Jul-2014 22:54:59]  <IllFlower> That's funny. She could have sworn there was one blocking a few of the windows on that tall blue building over there...
[20-Jul-2014 22:55:54]  <IllFlower> ("'Nah, it's not important,' she thinks to herself, and promptly falls asleep.")
[20-Jul-2014 22:56:13]  <Alicia> ( D: )
[20-Jul-2014 22:57:42]  <IllFlower> Well, presumably she's going to at least mention something.
[20-Jul-2014 22:58:11]  <Alicia> (Yeh.)
[20-Jul-2014 22:58:46]  <Rig> Hey, gonna have to jump out. Sorry
[20-Jul-2014 22:59:03]  <Rig> Having to repair some damage the dog did.
[20-Jul-2014 22:59:16]  *** Rig <~Iverum@c-50-148-120-29.hsd1.in.comcast.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Rig)
[20-Jul-2014 22:59:17]  <BGTB2005> We'll say Kazuki fell alseep or something
[20-Jul-2014 22:59:22]  <BGTB2005> *asleep
[20-Jul-2014 22:59:39]  <ponicalica> heh
[20-Jul-2014 22:59:54]  <ponicalica> if Kazuki's sleeping, Hikari should probably ask Ayako about the barrier or something
[20-Jul-2014 23:02:48]  <Alicia> Hikari nudges Ayako quickly. "Hey, I just saw... some sort of barrier around an apartment some ways behind us, it'd be about..." She gestures uselessly, before getting to the point. "I think we'll need to check that out after we're done with this. I'm not sure why someone would be so openly using magic unless it was to hide themselves..."
[20-Jul-2014 23:04:32]  <ponicalica> Ayako picks up a copy of the train map(do Japanese trains have those?) and marks near their current location "Magical barrier; investigate"
[20-Jul-2014 23:05:07]  <BGTB2005> pretty sure
[20-Jul-2014 23:05:19]  <ponicalica> "That's worth looking into; we saw what happened with Mai's magical barrier.  I think the witch attack's a bit more pressing, though."
[20-Jul-2014 23:05:24]  <IllFlower> Ayako's good at sketches.
[20-Jul-2014 23:06:23]  <BGTB2005> I have a map of a metro network from a few years ago
[20-Jul-2014 23:06:28]  <IllFlower> The train runs back to Kikugawa without incident otherwise.
[20-Jul-2014 23:08:00]  <BGTB2005> I think it was Tokyo's?
[20-Jul-2014 23:08:26]  <Alicia> Hikari nods. "Oh of course..."
[20-Jul-2014 23:08:32]  <IllFlower> Mai is in reasonably good shape when the Conservators arrive. She's sustained a few injuries, all of which bear a remarkable similarity to Megumi's, but they're nothing severe.
[20-Jul-2014 23:09:28]  <IllFlower> "I didn't get here by letting one measly witch take me down," she says defiantly.
[20-Jul-2014 23:13:17]  <ponicalica> Do Hikari or Rin want to take the front this time around?
[20-Jul-2014 23:15:15]  <ponicalica> Ayako notices the rope burns.  "Did the witch seem...familiar?"
[20-Jul-2014 23:16:08]  <IllFlower> Mai laughs. "Clever."
[20-Jul-2014 23:18:20]  <IllFlower> When Ayako fails to laugh along with her, Mai awkwardly picks up again.
[20-Jul-2014 23:19:02]  <IllFlower> "It's not Kotomi, if that's what you mean. The rituals were all ropes, but her magic's fire-based. I'm sure you remember that part well."
[20-Jul-2014 23:21:49]  <ponicalica> Ayako cringes hard, then regains her composure.  "I thought so.
[20-Jul-2014 23:23:45]  <Alicia> "Can you trace the ritual back to anyone in particular?"
[20-Jul-2014 23:27:34]  <IllFlower> "I remember Kotomi telling me she got the idea from someone else, but I don't think she ever mentioned anyone by name. I'd ask her, if I could find her..."
[20-Jul-2014 23:31:36]  <ponicalica> I was about to ask about another cult member but then I remembered that that was Kazuto who is in meguca jail
[20-Jul-2014 23:31:43]  <ponicalica> or well probably in meguca jail
[20-Jul-2014 23:33:05]  <IllFlower> I dunno if he's in *jail* jail.
[20-Jul-2014 23:33:19]  <BGTB2005> Kotomi probably got the binding and such from Hikari :P
[20-Jul-2014 23:33:20]  <Alicia> Oh, so just meguca jail jail.
[20-Jul-2014 23:33:22]  <IllFlower> Hm, unless you think of what he did as exfiltrating classified documents...
[20-Jul-2014 23:33:27]  <Alicia> BGTB2005: Pffft.

[20-Jul-2014 23:34:57]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: "I never met anyone in our group who used binding magic, either."
[20-Jul-2014 23:38:32]  <ponicalica> I'm basically at the "not sure what to ask" point
[20-Jul-2014 23:40:37]  <ponicalica> Alicia, BGTB2005?
[20-Jul-2014 23:41:30]  <Alicia> Same...
[20-Jul-2014 23:41:35]  <BGTB2005> ...I got nothing
[20-Jul-2014 23:41:45]  <IllFlower> Well, there were a couple of new pieces of information there.
[20-Jul-2014 23:42:03]  <IllFlower> I don't have anything else here, though.
[20-Jul-2014 23:42:43]  <IllFlower> So what next?
[20-Jul-2014 23:43:00]  <IllFlower> Mourning the fact that Kazuki has apparently gone comatose?
[20-Jul-2014 23:43:24]  <Alicia> Still steaming over his friend.

[20-Jul-2014 23:44:48]  <ponicalica> Maybe the barrier, but at this point I think it's kind of awkward without Rig/Kazuki
[20-Jul-2014 23:45:36]  <IllFlower> Shall we break until next time, then?
[20-Jul-2014 23:45:57]  <ponicalica> if the others are fine with it, yes
[20-Jul-2014 23:46:11]  <BGTB2005> sure
[20-Jul-2014 23:46:35]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[20-Jul-2014 23:47:02]  <IllFlower> Then so it shall be done.
[20-Jul-2014 23:47:21]  <IllFlower> Thanks again, everyone. Until Saturday.
