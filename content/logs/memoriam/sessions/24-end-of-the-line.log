[14-Jun-2014 21:27:57]  <IllFlower> Okay, why don't we get started?

[14-Jun-2014 21:28:59]  <ponicalica> TAKE THE STAGE, EI EI OH
[14-Jun-2014 21:29:07]  <Alicia> TRIUMP MAGIC.
[14-Jun-2014 21:29:11]  <Alicia> TRIUMPH MAGIC*
[14-Jun-2014 21:29:29]  <IllFlower> I think last time we left off with the Conservators' unceremonious defeat at Michi's hands.
[14-Jun-2014 21:29:40]  <ponicalica> well, Rin's, but yeah
[14-Jun-2014 21:29:52]  <ponicalica> Ayako and Hikari just stood and watched
[14-Jun-2014 21:29:54]  <IllFlower> So, what's the plan this time?
[14-Jun-2014 21:30:45]  <ponicalica> hmm
[14-Jun-2014 21:30:49]  <BGTB2005> (kill michi in her sleep)
[14-Jun-2014 21:30:57]  <Alicia> "So uh, we're back, Shii. We got owned, and I apologize on behalf of the team..."
[14-Jun-2014 21:31:11]  <ponicalica> Alicia: lol
[14-Jun-2014 21:31:36]  <IllFlower> Hahaha.
[14-Jun-2014 21:31:57]  <IllFlower> Well, the critical problem of Yumiko's quandary still hasn't been solved.
[14-Jun-2014 21:33:23]  <IllFlower> Presumably, fixing that remains the girls' objective.

[14-Jun-2014 21:33:57]  <Alicia> Oh yes. But I'm not sure where to go from here.
[14-Jun-2014 21:33:57]  <IllFlower> The way I see it, talking to either Shii or Yumiko might be prudent.
[14-Jun-2014 21:33:57]  <ponicalica> Hmm.  Part of me thinks that there might be some way to convince the girls who aren't Michi, but the problem is I have no idea how that'd happen
[14-Jun-2014 21:34:17]  <ponicalica> But yeah, talking to Shii and reporting on what happened might be a good idea
[14-Jun-2014 21:34:19]  <IllFlower> You could always band-aid a solution. :p
[14-Jun-2014 21:34:33]  <Fiora> IllFlower: I-I'm not that small!

[14-Jun-2014 21:34:38]  <Alicia> "Hey, we just tried to beat up your older friend, but would you mind us talking to you anyway? We don't want to hurt you, honest."
[14-Jun-2014 21:35:06]  <BGTB2005> ("Unless you give us reason to.")

[14-Jun-2014 21:35:34]  <IllFlower> lol.
[14-Jun-2014 21:35:56]  <IllFlower> Are we talking to the familiar, then?
[14-Jun-2014 21:36:23]  <Alicia> Seems like a good course of action, yeah.
[14-Jun-2014 21:36:47]  <IllFlower> "la famili√®re"
[14-Jun-2014 21:38:32]  <IllFlower> The Conservators go to find Shii in the abandoned church office, but she's not there. After some searching, they find her out on the roof of the adjacent annex, taking in the spring breeze.
[14-Jun-2014 21:38:58]  <ponicalica> ("You fucked up.")
[14-Jun-2014 21:39:05]  <IllFlower> Shii greets the girls. She does a double-take upon seeing Rin, who appears to be clearly the worse for wear.
[14-Jun-2014 21:39:24]  <IllFlower> "How... did the stakeout go?" she asks, with some trepidation.
[14-Jun-2014 21:39:58]  <ponicalica> "We broke up the fitness test, but then Rin decided to take matters into her own hands, and, well..."
[14-Jun-2014 21:40:57]  <Alicia> Hikari clears her throat. "We... were successful, up to a point. We aren't quite on the best of terms with them now."
[14-Jun-2014 21:41:20]  <Alicia> "Nor we were able to gain any information on Yumiko's situation."
[14-Jun-2014 21:41:41]  <IllFlower> I'm going to go with what Alicia just said, if that's okay.
[14-Jun-2014 21:41:49]  <ponicalica> fair enough
[14-Jun-2014 21:42:22]  <IllFlower> "Well, sometimes that happens," Shii says. "Patience is a necessity.
[14-Jun-2014 21:42:28]  <IllFlower> "What happened to Rin?"
[14-Jun-2014 21:43:11]  <Alicia> "Well, we-" she halfheartedly laughs, and puts on a smile. "we broke it up, only for Rin to attack Michi soon after."
[14-Jun-2014 21:43:57]  <BGTB2005> "I tried to get Michi to stop the fitness tests."
[14-Jun-2014 21:44:28]  <IllFlower> "Wait, did the three of you actually intervene?"
[14-Jun-2014 21:44:46]  <IllFlower> Shii looks puzzled. "I was under the impression that you were there just to surveil."
[14-Jun-2014 21:46:06]  <ponicalica> "We saw them attacking the new girl."
[14-Jun-2014 21:46:06]  <Alicia> "We - uh, I, and the others, jumped the gun once we saw one of the girls fall down in pain."
[14-Jun-2014 21:46:50]  <IllFlower> "Hold on. Start from the beginning. What exactly happened?"
[14-Jun-2014 21:49:46]  <Alicia> "We were at the school surveying, as mentioned before the assignment. There, we stayed hidden, as younger initiates filtered out around Michi and her friend. Shortly thereafter Michi began atta- ... using magic on a fellow girl, and that is when we... attacked."
[14-Jun-2014 21:50:16]  <Alicia> Hikari looks to Ayako and Rin before letting her eyes gaze off, away from Shii.
[14-Jun-2014 21:50:47]  <IllFlower> Shii gives Hikari a disturbed look. "And what kind of magic are we talking about here?"

[14-Jun-2014 21:51:26]  <ponicalica> "The first one was a pretty standard explosion.  The second...I think it was a direct strike against her mind."
[14-Jun-2014 21:51:46]  <Alicia> "The... usual, Shii. From each side."
[14-Jun-2014 21:54:24]  <IllFlower> Shii shakes her head. "Even with the best of intentions, that's beyond the pale.
[14-Jun-2014 21:54:46]  <IllFlower> "I don't see how their familiar could possibly approve of this, let alone be unaware of it."
[14-Jun-2014 21:55:55]  <Alicia> "Nyoma is a relaxed familiar, that much we're sure of. Although, it wouldn't surprise me if some things slipped by Nyoma..."
[14-Jun-2014 21:56:31]  <ponicalica> I'm guessing that familiars don't operate by emburst-style "lol you can't hurt familiars" rules here?
[14-Jun-2014 21:57:30]  <IllFlower> "This isn't just 'relaxed,' this sounds like essential negligence.
[14-Jun-2014 21:57:39]  <IllFlower> "What do you mean when you say 'slipped by'?"

[14-Jun-2014 21:59:31]  <Alicia> "It's an understatement, yes... And, well, Nyoma essentially cozied up to Michi when we were there. Didn't seem to have a care in the world. I wouldn't be surprised if Michi, or others, talked him into letting some things happen."
[14-Jun-2014 21:59:45]  <Alicia> "Leaving out important details, that sort of thing."
[14-Jun-2014 22:02:15]  <IllFlower> "I'm not sure you understand, Hikari. Nyoma's failing his basic responsibility to his initiates by not being aware enough of what's happening to stop this.
[14-Jun-2014 22:02:43]  <IllFlower> "Trust is fine, but there's a difference between that and blind following."
[14-Jun-2014 22:05:01]  <IllFlower> Shii paces back and forth across the roof. She seems to have a habit of doing this.
[14-Jun-2014 22:05:53]  <IllFlower> "I think I might have a solution.
[14-Jun-2014 22:06:04]  <IllFlower> "I'd ordinarily hesitate to suggest it, but the situation seems to warrant it."
[14-Jun-2014 22:06:33]  <Alicia> Hikari forces herself to stare back silently at Shii, until the words come. "... I - I mean, yes, yes he is. But I'm not sure what can-" she stops again, listening intently.
[14-Jun-2014 22:09:46]  <IllFlower> "Ayako?" Shii asks, abruptly.
[14-Jun-2014 22:10:51]  <IllFlower> "Do you remember what was happening with the members of Satsuki's sect before things got violent?"

[14-Jun-2014 22:13:19]  <ponicalica> "Not too closely.  I think you mentioned a lot of trading between familiars?"
[14-Jun-2014 22:14:58]  <IllFlower> "Yes, that's what I mean.
[14-Jun-2014 22:16:31]  <IllFlower> "I'm not sure if you know this, but occasionally we take all of a familiar's initiates out of their care.
[14-Jun-2014 22:17:48]  <IllFlower> "Given that the group no longer seems to answer to Nyoma, but rather to Miss Akase, I think it would be prudent to split them all up. Miss Kayano included, of course."
[14-Jun-2014 22:17:54]  <IllFlower> Shii's eyes darken.
[14-Jun-2014 22:18:22]  <IllFlower> "At that point, since Nyoma would no longer have any charges, he would be..."
[14-Jun-2014 22:18:28]  <IllFlower> She trails off, not finishing her sentence.
[14-Jun-2014 22:19:30]  <Alicia> "Excuse me, please, Shii. What would happen to Nyoma?"
[14-Jun-2014 22:21:41]  <IllFlower> "The Order would release him," Shii says, carefully choosing her words.
[14-Jun-2014 22:24:13]  <ponicalica> "Won't Nyoma resist that, though?"
[14-Jun-2014 22:25:20]  <IllFlower> "We all serve at the leisure of the Prophets. It's the sole reason we exist."
[14-Jun-2014 22:28:13]  <Alicia> "Ah. The Order, and all of us..." she trails off, making sense of Shii's words.
[14-Jun-2014 22:29:40]  <IllFlower> Shii's "we" means the familiars here, I should clarify.
[14-Jun-2014 22:30:33]  <Alicia> (Mmhm.)
[14-Jun-2014 22:31:54]  <IllFlower> "I'm sure you understand why I'm hesitant to do this, but I'd rather this than possibly losing an initiate."
[14-Jun-2014 22:33:25]  <IllFlower> Shii turns and looks back at the sky beyond the edge of the roof.
[14-Jun-2014 22:35:24]  <IllFlower> "I'll put in a request for Nyoma's deactivation. His charges should all be reassigned by tomorrow, Miss Kayano included."
[14-Jun-2014 22:35:48]  <IllFlower> She seems to mumble something to herself as a postscript, but it's too faint for the girls to hear.
[14-Jun-2014 22:36:17]  <Alicia> "I'm glad Kayano shall, hopefully, be somewhere safe again."
[14-Jun-2014 22:42:04]  <IllFlower> Well, we're essentially done with this scene, as far as I can tell.
[14-Jun-2014 22:43:08]  <IllFlower> What else is there left to do?
[14-Jun-2014 22:45:11]  <Alicia> Hm... talk to Yumiko, later, but otherwise I think we've gotten Shii all caught up?
[14-Jun-2014 22:45:19]  <Alicia> I could be missing things.
[14-Jun-2014 22:46:23]  <IllFlower> Big picture-wise?
[14-Jun-2014 22:46:49]  <Alicia> I was referring to just this right here, but.
[14-Jun-2014 22:47:53]  <Alicia> to things left in this session*
[14-Jun-2014 22:48:05]  <IllFlower> If there's nothing left to do, we may even be closed out on this branch.
[14-Jun-2014 22:48:30]  <IllFlower> The girls can talk to Yumiko, though.
[14-Jun-2014 22:49:05]  <Alicia> Oh yeah.
[14-Jun-2014 22:51:26]  <IllFlower> Yeah, I've got that. It doesn't seem like there's much left anyway, so we're basically done here plus or minus whatever conclusive scenes.
[14-Jun-2014 22:55:13]  <IllFlower> Alicia, BGTB2005: What sayeth you?
[14-Jun-2014 22:55:50]  <Alicia> I say we're done here, yeah.
[14-Jun-2014 22:56:41]  <BGTB2005> I'd like to talk with Yumiko, but yeah, I think we're otherwise done
[14-Jun-2014 22:58:46]  <IllFlower> Okay. Yumiko talk now or later?
[14-Jun-2014 22:58:54]  <Alicia> Later.
[14-Jun-2014 23:00:44]  <IllFlower> Okay. We'll go ahead and wrap up now, and finish the Yumiko scene next time.
[14-Jun-2014 23:00:57]  <IllFlower> I imagine it'll be short, so we'll go ahead and start the next branch then as well.
[14-Jun-2014 23:01:28]  <IllFlower> In the meantime, feel free to work on the post-branch reflection stat changes.
[14-Jun-2014 23:01:41]  <IllFlower> Thanks, everyone. Until next session.
[14-Jun-2014 23:02:06]  <Alicia> Thanks for hosting as well.
