@time=2015-05-30T21:52:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I have no particular objection to that.
@time=2015-05-30T21:52:49.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But yeah, running a stakeout like we did back in the first arc could work
@time=2015-05-30T21:53:02.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("Have a seat over there." raise 3 3?)
@time=2015-05-30T21:55:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, so, we just wait and watch the school?
@time=2015-05-30T21:55:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :As the Conservators look at a map to try and figure out good locations for a stakeout, Shii suddenly appears on her desk with a louder-than-normal snap.
@time=2015-05-30T21:56:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Fiesty.
@time=2015-05-30T21:56:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :EI. Like Feist.

@time=2015-05-30T21:57:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki looks up at Shii. "Is everything all right?"
@time=2015-05-30T21:59:20.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What's going on?"
@time=2015-05-30T21:59:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Things are a bit up in arms at headquarters. A familiar retired overnight and there's been a scramble to reassign his charges to new familiars."
@time=2015-05-30T22:00:06.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki raises an eyebrow. "Anyone we would know?"
@time=2015-05-30T22:01:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Someone named Myaa. He had six or seven initiates under his wing."
@time=2015-05-30T22:01:58.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako looks around at the other initiates.
@time=2015-05-30T22:02:27.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki isn't particularly surprised. "Why did he retire? Wait, you can retire?"
@time=2015-05-30T22:04:05.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think it's a euphemism?
@time=2015-05-30T22:04:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"No familiar sticks around forever. Some of them make that decision."
@time=2015-05-30T22:04:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii's voice suggests that this is far from the first time she's seen this happen.
@time=2015-05-30T22:05:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"They usually don't have this many initiates, though. One at most."
@time=2015-05-30T22:06:48.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Did Myaa say anything about why he did this?"
@time=2015-05-30T22:08:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It'd be remarkably abrupt if he hadn't, but I don't know."
@time=2015-05-30T22:10:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: You might be on to something...
@time=2015-05-30T22:11:44.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's a euphemism in the same way Nyoma being "released" was a euphemism
@time=2015-05-30T22:12:23.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What is going to happen to the initiates that Myaa was in charge of?"
@time=2015-05-30T22:13:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii mentioned they're getting reassigned.

@time=2015-05-30T22:16:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, different question.
@time=2015-05-30T22:16:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We'll close in a bit.
@time=2015-05-30T22:16:32.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Did Myaa have any people they were initiating? What happens to them?"
@time=2015-05-30T22:17:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That's up to how much the Prophets want a potential initiate, I suppose. Why do you ask?"
@time=2015-05-30T22:18:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We went to speak to Myaa yesterday," Kazuki comes clean. "Myaa was in charge of the recruitment of one of Rin's friends. We were concerned."
@time=2015-05-30T22:20:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Wait, the one that was wondering whether or not to become an initiate and came to Rin about it?"
@time=2015-05-30T22:20:22.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki nods.
@time=2015-05-30T22:20:24.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yes."
@time=2015-05-30T22:21:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shii is silent for a while.
@time=2015-05-30T22:22:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"This friend, she was a classmate of the recent murder victims, no?"
@time=2015-05-30T22:22:46.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That's correct."
@time=2015-05-30T22:24:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Something is up," Shii says. "This pattern doesn't make sense.
@time=2015-05-30T22:24:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The fact that there were still any familiars trying to make contracts there doesn't make sense."
@time=2015-05-30T22:25:07.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm glad we agree."

@time=2015-05-30T22:26:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki doesn't know if he should reveal their suspicions even to Shii. He's technically part of their team, but it feels like a breach to tell him.

@time=2015-05-30T22:33:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I... I'd suggest speaking to a trusted Prophet, perhaps."
