[01-Jun-2014 20:04:36]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Madoka Goes to Washington
[01-Jun-2014 20:05:03]  <IllFlower> All right. When we left off, Shii had just given Rin a talking-to.
[01-Jun-2014 20:05:28]  <IllFlower> Before that, Ayako and Hikari had just ferreted out some potentially useful information from Michi.
[01-Jun-2014 20:06:08]  <ponicalica> That Yumiko's dad was probably yakuza, and the whole "bond" thing she has going on, yeah?
[01-Jun-2014 20:06:16]  <IllFlower> What next? I believe there was some interest in talking to Yumiko, along with the little unresolved detail of the fitness test.
[01-Jun-2014 20:06:32]  <IllFlower> Bond? James Bond?
[01-Jun-2014 20:06:46]  <ponicalica> er, maybe not bond was the word she used
[01-Jun-2014 20:07:25]  <IllFlower> Oh, the "banding together" thing?
[01-Jun-2014 20:07:32]  <ponicalica> yeah
[01-Jun-2014 20:07:32]  <ponicalica> lol
[01-Jun-2014 20:07:35]  <BGTB2005> ("welcoming her into the group"?)
[01-Jun-2014 20:07:53]  <IllFlower> It's just a party with some tea and cake, obviously.
[01-Jun-2014 20:08:07]  <Alicia> Yeah, if memory serves we wanted to chat with Yumiko and see what's up with the "fitness test."
[01-Jun-2014 20:08:16]  <Alicia> Not sure if there was anything else.
[01-Jun-2014 20:09:03]  <ponicalica> I think those were the main things.
[01-Jun-2014 20:09:15]  <ponicalica> Do y'all remember what you wanted to ask Yumiko?
[01-Jun-2014 20:09:45]  <Alicia> No. >_>;
[01-Jun-2014 20:09:58]  <IllFlower> Feel free to set the scene.
[01-Jun-2014 20:10:05]  <BGTB2005> ...I'll think of something to ask?
[01-Jun-2014 20:10:14]  <Alicia> Couldn't hurt to ask her about the test, though? Unless it could hurt, heheh.
[01-Jun-2014 20:10:14]  <IllFlower> I'll just be here eating potato chips.
[01-Jun-2014 20:10:37]  <ponicalica> Alicia: well, it could bring back some traumatic memories, maybe
[01-Jun-2014 20:11:18]  <Alicia> ponicalica: True. Not sure if indirectly asking about Michi would be any more helpful than last time...
[01-Jun-2014 20:13:08]  <ponicalica> Alicia: yeah.  It might be good just to skip to the fitness test, really, unless you or BGTB2005  has a specific question.
[01-Jun-2014 20:13:19]  <Alicia> I don't think so, really.
[01-Jun-2014 20:13:27]  <IllFlower> There was the thing with her family.
[01-Jun-2014 20:13:48]  <IllFlower> Although, hey, it can't hurt to check in and see how she's feeling.
[01-Jun-2014 20:14:56]  <Alicia> ("Didn't you get reprimanded for-" "I don't want to hurt you. >:|")
[01-Jun-2014 20:15:09]  <Alicia> Yeaah, sounds good.
[01-Jun-2014 20:15:37]  <BGTB2005> yeah, a quick check-up sounds like a good idea
[01-Jun-2014 20:16:05]  <IllFlower> Then let's do that.
[01-Jun-2014 20:17:01]  <ponicalica> The three Conservators head towards the room in which Yumiko has been held for the past however long(days?), relieving whatever rookie Conservator had been assigned to this job of duty.
[01-Jun-2014 20:17:21]  <IllFlower> She's in one of the church's many small group rooms, playing a rather old video game on a rather old television. She's been staying home from school, taking advantage of the hierarchy's massive absence excuse machine.
[01-Jun-2014 20:17:43]  <IllFlower> It's an old machine that throws up clouds of smoke whenever it needs to craft an excuse, but I digress.
[01-Jun-2014 20:17:56]  <Alicia> (She's a smart girl.)
[01-Jun-2014 20:18:50]  <IllFlower> Presumably one of the Conservators says "hi" or something.
[01-Jun-2014 20:19:03]  <Alicia> Hikari walks up and pats Yumiko on the shoulder "Hey, Hikari here. Have you been feeling any better?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:20:11]  <IllFlower> ("HEY HIKARI HERE FOR OXI-CLEAN")
[01-Jun-2014 20:20:27]  <BGTB2005> pffff
[01-Jun-2014 20:20:31]  <Alicia> Hahaha.
[01-Jun-2014 20:21:44]  <IllFlower> "Hm?" Yumiko sets aside the controller, and thus her quest to become the greatest farmer in town, for a moment. "Oh, hi.
[01-Jun-2014 20:22:18]  <IllFlower> "I'm doing fine. Haven't jumped off any roofs today." She laughs hesitantly at her own joke.
[01-Jun-2014 20:24:02]  <ponicalica> "That's good.  Has your magic felt, uh, out of control recently?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:24:49]  <Alicia> Hikari chuckles back the best she can. "Well, at least you're safe here, it sounds like." She scans the room, noting pleasantly, how utterly mundane it is.
[01-Jun-2014 20:25:08]  <Alicia> (By which I mean, nothing's destroooyed.)
[01-Jun-2014 20:25:19]  <IllFlower> "Well, I haven't really had a reason to use it now, have I?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:26:00]  <IllFlower> Yumiko shrugs. "Everything's under control if it doesn't do anything."
[01-Jun-2014 20:26:20]  <BGTB2005> (>_>)
[01-Jun-2014 20:26:37]  <ponicalica> Ayako whispers to Hikari for confirmation, probably loud enough for a sound mage like Yumiko to hear it: "What was that you found in Michi's dorm again: fitness test?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:27:35]  <IllFlower> Probably loud enough?
[01-Jun-2014 20:27:45]  <ponicalica> i.e. not quiet enough, I dunno
[01-Jun-2014 20:27:47]  <Alicia> She nods. "But do you want to ask..?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:27:48]  <ponicalica> :V
[01-Jun-2014 20:27:53]  <IllFlower> Are you hint-hinting me?
[01-Jun-2014 20:27:59]  <BGTB2005> maybe?
[01-Jun-2014 20:28:15]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Yeah, I'm getting you to force my hand on my indecisiveness
[01-Jun-2014 20:28:15]  <Alicia> I assume Rin is glaring at the happy farm on the screen.
[01-Jun-2014 20:30:50]  <ponicalica> "It might be good.  I mean, if this is a common thing for new initiates, presumably she'd know about it..."
[01-Jun-2014 20:31:18]  <IllFlower> "What are you guys whispering about?" Yumiko asks, tilting her head in confusion.
[01-Jun-2014 20:31:29]  <IllFlower> ("I said, with a posed look")
[01-Jun-2014 20:32:34]  <ponicalica> "Uh, do the words «fitness test» mean anything to you?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:34:35]  <Alicia> "We found out about one coming up soon when gathering information, and it... seems fairly important."
[01-Jun-2014 20:34:38]  <IllFlower> "You mean Akase's little ritual?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:34:46]  <Alicia> ("We? You were the one scavenging!")
[01-Jun-2014 20:34:55]  <IllFlower> Yumiko's expression darkens a bit.
[01-Jun-2014 20:37:13]  <IllFlower> "Yeah, I've heard her talk about it. I've never been part of one, though.
[01-Jun-2014 20:38:03]  <IllFlower> "She keeps insisting that I need to go through one to really be part of the group, but I don't see why I should have to do something like that. I'm already part of the group just by having the same familiar, no?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:39:57]  <IllFlower> She bites her lip, falling silent.
[01-Jun-2014 20:40:11]  <ponicalica> "Well, there are supposed to be things that can deepen the bond between initiates.  Hikari, I think we might need to see this «fitness test» for ourselves."
[01-Jun-2014 20:41:28]  <IllFlower> Rin's just chopped liver, apparently.
[01-Jun-2014 20:42:02]  <Alicia> "Agreed, Ayako." She looks back to Yumiko. "But I'm curious, do you know from other initiates what the test might entail? Or has she kept in entirely under wraps?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:42:11]  <ponicalica> I realized that after I said it that I forgot her name, but considering what happened I think it works as passive-aggressiveness, so
[01-Jun-2014 20:42:51]  <Alicia> (Just imagining Rin also broke an earring other something, heh.)
[01-Jun-2014 20:44:35]  <IllFlower> "I don't think it's a secret. I just haven't asked."
[01-Jun-2014 20:46:51]  <BGTB2005> "Did you get a look at any of the others after their tests?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:48:28]  <IllFlower> "No. I've been the newest one for a while now.
[01-Jun-2014 20:48:56]  <IllFlower> "Well, no, I take that back. There's another girl who just initiated. I don't remember her name, though, and I don't think she's been through her test yet."
[01-Jun-2014 20:53:14]  <Alicia> "And did Akari and her group ostracize you for not participating?"
[01-Jun-2014 20:53:28]  <ponicalica> Akari? lol
[01-Jun-2014 20:53:39]  <Alicia> Did I... say a wrong thing.
[01-Jun-2014 20:53:51]  <Alicia> Fuck.
[01-Jun-2014 20:53:53]  <Alicia> Sorry.
[01-Jun-2014 20:53:57]  <Alicia> Akase*
[01-Jun-2014 20:54:03]  <BGTB2005> yes i believe you horrifically mangled someone's name
[01-Jun-2014 20:54:10]  <Alicia> Yes I know okay. ;-;
[01-Jun-2014 20:54:16]  <ponicalica> whatever, you meant Michi Akase, now Yumiko's going to be confused for a short bit before she realizes
[01-Jun-2014 20:54:27]  <Alicia> "Sorry, Akase."
[01-Jun-2014 20:54:28]  <IllFlower> Akari was a different girl.
[01-Jun-2014 20:54:35]  <Alicia> >_<
[01-Jun-2014 20:54:52]  <IllFlower> It's okay. Hikari wouldn't have known her.
[01-Jun-2014 20:55:55]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@234.179-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[01-Jun-2014 20:56:40]  <ponicalica> i don't even remember which girl akari was :V
[01-Jun-2014 20:57:18]  <IllFlower> "Something like that. They certainly don't go out of their way to talk to me."
[01-Jun-2014 20:57:46]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Kei's friend. She mostly cried.
[01-Jun-2014 20:58:02]  <ponicalica> oh right, emburst, lol
[01-Jun-2014 21:00:46]  <ponicalica> Does Alicia or BGTB2005 have anything else to ask?
[01-Jun-2014 21:00:46]  <IllFlower> All right, anything else? Make popcorn, raze Yumiko's farms, something like that?
[01-Jun-2014 21:00:47]  <Alicia> "Certainly doesn't help that Nyoma seems so spacey, I'm sure. Do you know the new girl's name, by the way? Or any identifying features?"
[01-Jun-2014 21:01:07]  <Alicia> I'm pretty sure only one of us would raze her farms. It would not end well.
[01-Jun-2014 21:01:16]  <BGTB2005> only if provoked
[01-Jun-2014 21:01:30]  <ponicalica> Alicia: it's on the paper you saw iirc
[01-Jun-2014 21:01:33]  <BGTB2005> also: 'I don't remember her name, though'
[01-Jun-2014 21:01:39]  <Alicia> Ack right.
[01-Jun-2014 21:01:52]  <ponicalica> identifying features would be good though
[01-Jun-2014 21:01:53]  <Alicia> Cut: All but features.
[01-Jun-2014 21:01:56]  <Alicia> >_<
[01-Jun-2014 21:02:12]  <IllFlower> "She's young, I remember that much. I think she said she just started high school.
[01-Jun-2014 21:02:31]  <IllFlower> "She seemed very earnest. To be honest, I'm a little worried, but..."
[01-Jun-2014 21:02:34]  <IllFlower> Yumiko trails off.
[01-Jun-2014 21:05:38]  <Alicia> "Then we have more cause for concern." Hikari faces the other two. "Either of you take issue with us heading out now?"
[01-Jun-2014 21:05:52]  <IllFlower> Is it Saturday yet?
[01-Jun-2014 21:06:09]  <ponicalica> "Well, we can't do much until the fitness test is actually being set up."
[01-Jun-2014 21:06:15]  <Alicia> If it's not, we'll just setup camp and wait it out.
[01-Jun-2014 21:06:17]  <Alicia> (I kid.)
[01-Jun-2014 21:06:19]  <ponicalica> But yeah, OOC, let's skip to the fitness test
[01-Jun-2014 21:06:51]  <Alicia> Mhm.
[01-Jun-2014 21:07:00]  <BGTB2005> sure
[01-Jun-2014 21:07:46]  <IllFlower> TIME WARP
[01-Jun-2014 21:08:15]  * Alicia imagines the Teleglitch noises.
[01-Jun-2014 21:08:39]  <IllFlower> The Conservators make their way out in front of the Takami High School campus about an hour before the fitness test is scheduled.
[01-Jun-2014 21:08:53]  <IllFlower> It doesn't look like anyone's around yet, which gives them time to formulate a plan of attack.
[01-Jun-2014 21:10:13]  <IllFlower> And that plan is... /drumroll
[01-Jun-2014 21:11:20]  <Alicia> Definitely not punching Akase the second we see her.
[01-Jun-2014 21:11:24]  <BGTB2005> ...what plan?
[01-Jun-2014 21:12:49]  <ponicalica> Maybe something like what we did the first arc where we hide in order to see where Michi et al are going?
[01-Jun-2014 21:14:18]  <Alicia> "So, Ayako, Rin, what plans do you have in mind? There's always tailing them, or waiting and listening, to see if they mentioned important locations."
[01-Jun-2014 21:15:00]  <Alicia> "Then we can watch them there..." she trails off, unsure.
[01-Jun-2014 21:15:31]  <BGTB2005> "Wait, listen, and observe."
[01-Jun-2014 21:15:51]  <IllFlower> They mentioned here. It's what was in Michi's notebook.
[01-Jun-2014 21:17:18]  <Alicia> I assumed that was, like, the initial meeting. Because [worst possible testy thing] in a schoolyard seems :v
[01-Jun-2014 21:17:23]  * Alicia is assuming, bluh.
[01-Jun-2014 21:17:48]  <ponicalica> I was thinking, like, they'll set up something to do the fitness test with, and maybe we could hear them saying plans?  I dunno
[01-Jun-2014 21:19:22]  <IllFlower> We gonna stake this thing out?
[01-Jun-2014 21:19:40]  <BGTB2005> "At least it's not a riverbank," Rin mutters
[01-Jun-2014 21:19:48]  <BGTB2005> I guess?
[01-Jun-2014 21:20:29]  <Alicia> Locate the nearest bush.
[01-Jun-2014 21:20:42]  <BGTB2005> or tree
[01-Jun-2014 21:21:08]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: yeah that's basiaclly where I was going, yeah
[01-Jun-2014 21:21:28]  <IllFlower> Well, there is an entire school building you could probably conceal yourselves in.
[01-Jun-2014 21:22:59]  <IllFlower> Hope you guys brought a pair of binoculars.
[01-Jun-2014 21:23:40]  <BGTB2005> Hikari has a few in her Great Bag of Everything, right?
[01-Jun-2014 21:23:49]  <ponicalica> yeah
[01-Jun-2014 21:24:14]  <Alicia> Hikari shuffles around in her bag, taking out three pairs of binoculars and a sandwich, passing them out. "If you don't want them now, you can take them home, if you want."
[01-Jun-2014 21:24:21]  <Alicia> around*
[01-Jun-2014 21:24:37]  <BGTB2005> just one sandwich?
[01-Jun-2014 21:24:50]  <Alicia> We have to go light.
[01-Jun-2014 21:25:04]  <IllFlower> You don't want to know what else is in her bag.
[01-Jun-2014 21:25:17]  <Alicia> Just one sandwich is potentially messy, as is. Can't leave traces, BGTB2005!
[01-Jun-2014 21:25:28]  <IllFlower> It's a classroom, dude.
[01-Jun-2014 21:25:40]  <Alicia> Yes yes. :p
[01-Jun-2014 21:25:50]  <IllFlower> I don't think anyone's going to notice a few additional breadcrumbs.
[01-Jun-2014 21:26:25]  <BGTB2005> I was thinking the roof as the vantage point
[01-Jun-2014 21:26:44]  <ponicalica> Ayako munches on her (part of the?) sandwich while looking at the track through the binoculars.  "They haven't arrived yet..."
[01-Jun-2014 21:26:51]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: man, roofs are where all anime characters eat lunch
[01-Jun-2014 21:26:56]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: they'll have even more breadcrumbs
[01-Jun-2014 21:27:06]  <IllFlower> After a long period of waiting, during which Ayako eats pretty much the entirety of the sandwich, a trickle of girls begins to appear in the schoolyard.
[01-Jun-2014 21:27:08]  <Alicia> Individual wiches.
[01-Jun-2014 21:27:43]  <ponicalica> this arc has featured so much of ayako eating things
[01-Jun-2014 21:27:50]  <IllFlower> Michi is there first, talking in serious tones with someone else who appears to be about her age.
[01-Jun-2014 21:28:45]  <IllFlower> A few more stream in as the appointed time approaches. They all look younger; a couple seem quite nervous.
[01-Jun-2014 21:30:51]  *** Xeniera <~Solstace@75-164-236-203.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[01-Jun-2014 21:30:51]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Xeniera
[01-Jun-2014 21:31:17]  <IllFlower> Finally, one last girl shows up at 3:00 on the dot. The one who was talking with Michi breaks off to meet her, while Michi addresses the others.
[01-Jun-2014 21:31:29]  <IllFlower> There are about ten people here. Not a small group.
[01-Jun-2014 21:32:03]  <BGTB2005> wait, where are the three? classroom or roof?
[01-Jun-2014 21:32:09]  <IllFlower> Your choice.
[01-Jun-2014 21:32:37]  <ponicalica> With roof I think there's a better chance of hearing things if Michi yells them, except I guess if we opn a window
[01-Jun-2014 21:33:13]  <IllFlower> After a minute or two of this, Michi leads the group over to the baseball diamond. The girl who arrived last takes hesitant steps towards the pitcher's mound, while the rest of them mill around home plate.
[01-Jun-2014 21:33:46]  *** Section42L <~Section@CPE18593345ef4c-CM18593345ef49.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[01-Jun-2014 21:34:08]  <BGTB2005> classroom would probably be a more comfortable vantage point, but roof would probably be easier to maintain line of sight
[01-Jun-2014 21:34:54]  <Alicia> Classroom I guess.
[01-Jun-2014 21:34:59]  <IllFlower> The girl who had been talking with Michi steps forward from the group, onto the plate itself.
[01-Jun-2014 21:35:36]  <IllFlower> Both of them transform, and then there's a long, baleful period of no motion at all...
[01-Jun-2014 21:35:51]  <BGTB2005> "I'm not sure I like this..."
[01-Jun-2014 21:36:40]  <ponicalica> "Looks like it might be a duel?"
[01-Jun-2014 21:37:15]  <BGTB2005> Do any of them recognise the girl who was talking with Michi?
[01-Jun-2014 21:39:15]  <IllFlower> Without warning, the ground explodes from underneath the pitcher's mound, enveloping most of the infield in an opaque cloud of grass and dust.
[01-Jun-2014 21:39:19]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Nope.
[01-Jun-2014 21:40:11]  <ponicalica> I kind of feel like this might be the thing Rin has a visceral reaction to...
[01-Jun-2014 21:41:00]  <IllFlower> The girl on home plate takes a deep breath, stepping back from her position.
[01-Jun-2014 21:42:59]  <BGTB2005> (debating on whether or not this would be a good opportunity for Rin to transform and prepare to intervene)
[01-Jun-2014 21:43:02]  <IllFlower> The scene clears to reveal a crater about two meters wide where the pitcher's mound once was. The girl is still standing there, her face looking slightly bruised. A thin stream of blood runs down one cheek.
[01-Jun-2014 21:43:37]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: I think she could fly out there
[01-Jun-2014 21:44:14]  <BGTB2005> I'm assuming the three arrived in civilian clothes
[01-Jun-2014 21:44:23]  <IllFlower> Another girl, one of the ones who had been looking nervous earlier, steps up to home plate.
[01-Jun-2014 21:45:47]  <IllFlower> She clasps her hands to her chest and whispers something.
[01-Jun-2014 21:47:10]  <IllFlower> For a second, it looks like nothing has happened, until the girl on home suddenly collapses to her knees. Her eyes are wide with shock, her hands grasping at her heart. It looks like she's trying to scream, but no sound comes out.
[01-Jun-2014 21:48:23]  <Alicia> "Ayako, do you think someone is assaulting her mind? Or perhaps..." she sighs." I can't tell, honestly."
[01-Jun-2014 21:48:25]  <IllFlower> This continues for ten, twenty, thirty seconds, the girl coming close to apparent unconsciousness.
[01-Jun-2014 21:48:35]  <BGTB2005> Rin transforms, flames briefly engulfing her body before dying down just as quickly
[01-Jun-2014 21:48:50]  <BGTB2005> (and almost setting the classroom on fire)
[01-Jun-2014 21:48:52]  <ponicalica> "I can't tell either.  There are a couple of things, that could do...that...but-"
[01-Jun-2014 21:49:10]  <ponicalica> "Whatever's going on, we should probably stop it."
[01-Jun-2014 21:49:30]  <IllFlower> Finally, Michi steps forward and lays her hand on the caster's shoulder. The girl on home plate takes a massive, pained breath, as if she'd just come to the surface after nearly drowning.
[01-Jun-2014 21:49:38]  <BGTB2005> "Yes."
[01-Jun-2014 21:49:41]  <IllFlower> s/home plate/the pitcher's mound/
[01-Jun-2014 21:49:42]  <Alicia> "Yes. Rin, where are you going first?"
[01-Jun-2014 21:49:57]  <Alicia> (Can't have you diving in without us knowing, much...)
[01-Jun-2014 21:50:15]  <ponicalica> "Rin, you should fly over there.  Don't do...what you did to Tsubaki, but interrupt them."
[01-Jun-2014 21:50:31]  <BGTB2005> "I'm going straight for Michi."
[01-Jun-2014 21:50:37]  <IllFlower> The subject staggers to her feet as Michi takes the position at home.
[01-Jun-2014 21:51:17]  <IllFlower> afk for a minute, be back
[01-Jun-2014 21:51:21]  <ponicalica> "Hikari, follow me.  We won't be as fast as Rin, but we can get there."  Ayako begins walking down the stairs
[01-Jun-2014 21:51:34]  <ponicalica> ping me when he gets back
[01-Jun-2014 21:53:09]  <Alicia> "On it. We could probably take one of the girls away first... but I think it's best if we just stop who's in control, first."
[01-Jun-2014 21:53:16]  <Alicia> girls out of danger*
[01-Jun-2014 21:53:21]  *** SF_Sorrow <SF_Sorrow@college8-32-54.resnet.ucsc.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[01-Jun-2014 21:54:21]  <Alicia> (Which, obviously Michi for sure, but it sounds like others.)
[01-Jun-2014 21:54:27]  <BGTB2005> Rin exits through the window, struggling briefly to fit her wings through the gap
[01-Jun-2014 21:56:28]  <Alicia> (She pulls out a Warring Driver, we get owned.)
[01-Jun-2014 21:56:35]  <Alicia> (BANG BANG BANG!)
[01-Jun-2014 22:00:54]  <IllFlower> Back.
[01-Jun-2014 22:01:11]  <IllFlower> PONICALICA EVERYTHING YOU WROTE THERE IS A WORD
[01-Jun-2014 22:01:40]  <ponicalica> is IllFlower turning into Gene Ray?
[01-Jun-2014 22:02:19]  <Alicia> Ponicalica does enjoy using words. Generally, to say things. Sometimes stuff.
[01-Jun-2014 22:02:29]  <BGTB2005> words are kinda nice
[01-Jun-2014 22:02:53]  <IllFlower> So what's the plan here?
[01-Jun-2014 22:03:10]  <BGTB2005> Rin wants to kick Michi's teeth in
[01-Jun-2014 22:03:36]  <IllFlower> Gotta describe how you're doing it, man.
[01-Jun-2014 22:03:45]  <Alicia> I think Rin wants to pummel Michi, while Hikari and Ayako disarm the rest or something, so we can make Michi stop.
[01-Jun-2014 22:03:45]  <ponicalica> Rin flies in, presumably(in Ayako's thought) to do a "Halt! What you are doing is wrong! Why do you do this thing?" (but Rin wouldn't do that would she), while Ayako and Hikari follow behind
[01-Jun-2014 22:03:46]  <IllFlower> I need red meat to work with!
[01-Jun-2014 22:03:49]  <BGTB2005> in the most literal sense possible and from a few storeys up
[01-Jun-2014 22:04:03]  <ponicalica> So she's flying overhead, and dive-bombs in, maybe?
[01-Jun-2014 22:04:39]  <Alicia> Ayako can setup some sort of barrier?
[01-Jun-2014 22:04:49]  <ponicalica> barrior to what
[01-Jun-2014 22:04:52]  <BGTB2005> I was thinking Rin beelined from the window
[01-Jun-2014 22:05:07]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Make it so it's 3v1.
[01-Jun-2014 22:05:18]  <Alicia> So, to keep others out. But I dunno.
[01-Jun-2014 22:05:18]  <ponicalica> Alicia: Oh, like, isolate Michi?
[01-Jun-2014 22:05:30]  <Alicia> Yeah.
[01-Jun-2014 22:05:32]  <BGTB2005> Rin approves
[01-Jun-2014 22:05:48]  <ponicalica> I doubt IllFlower would let that go through without a fight
[01-Jun-2014 22:05:52]  <IllFlower> The shadows of Rin's immense wings darken home plate. Michi and the other girls would have to try not to notice.
[01-Jun-2014 22:06:04]  <IllFlower> It looks like we're going to have a conflict on our hands.
[01-Jun-2014 22:07:24]  <Alicia> Stakes... making sure Michi stops harming folks?
[01-Jun-2014 22:07:50]  <IllFlower> Too ambitious. Presumably the stakes are more like "break it up."
[01-Jun-2014 22:07:59]  <Alicia> Point.
[01-Jun-2014 22:08:24]  <Alicia> Yeah, sounds good to me.
[01-Jun-2014 22:08:29]  <BGTB2005> ensuring the immediate safety of what's-her-face?
[01-Jun-2014 22:08:29]  <ponicalica> make Michi stop harming this new initiate, presumably
[01-Jun-2014 22:08:55]  <IllFlower> What level are we starting at here?
[01-Jun-2014 22:09:12]  <BGTB2005> hand-to-hand?
[01-Jun-2014 22:09:34]  <ponicalica> Well we've started out with Rin flying over
[01-Jun-2014 22:09:56]  <IllFlower> Sounds a bit magical to me.
[01-Jun-2014 22:10:39]  <BGTB2005> I guess Rin could provide air support to get some of the others to flee...
[01-Jun-2014 22:11:17]  <IllFlower> The girl Michi had been talking to at the beginning of all this, the first one at home plate, steps up next to Michi. Looks like this is going to be 3 on 2.
[01-Jun-2014 22:12:26]  <BGTB2005> Good Weather For Airstrikes 2?
[01-Jun-2014 22:12:31]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: perhaps
[01-Jun-2014 22:13:24]  <IllFlower> Shall we start, then?
[01-Jun-2014 22:13:27]  <IllFlower> Are we going magic?
[01-Jun-2014 22:13:44]  <BGTB2005> (GWfA2: Now With Actual Close-Air Support)
[01-Jun-2014 22:13:46]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: I think at this point we may have to, since the suddenness of Rin's appearance probably forced it.
[01-Jun-2014 22:13:50]  <Alicia> 3 on 2? Aren't Hikari and AYako there too?
[01-Jun-2014 22:13:58]  <Alicia> Oh wait.
[01-Jun-2014 22:14:00]  <ponicalica> Alicia: yeah, Hikari, Ayako, and Rin are the 3
[01-Jun-2014 22:14:00]  <IllFlower> lol
[01-Jun-2014 22:14:02]  <Alicia> Misread. Ignore meee.
[01-Jun-2014 22:14:07]  <BGTB2005> Rin would probably consider it totally proportionate
[01-Jun-2014 22:14:19]  <Alicia> ponicalica, IllFlower: Yeah.
[01-Jun-2014 22:14:56]  <IllFlower> These numbers are probably going to be a bit hard to work with, but let's roll.
[01-Jun-2014 22:14:59]  <BGTB2005> So I guess Rin would need her Fancy Cannon as well...
[01-Jun-2014 22:14:59]  <IllFlower> Magic to start with.

[01-Jun-2014 22:17:22]  <BGTB2005> use trashheap for the mystery girl?
[01-Jun-2014 22:17:25]  <IllFlower> Well, it looks like Rin is raising first, so let's go with that.
[01-Jun-2014 22:17:56]  <BGTB2005> should I add wings and costume?
[01-Jun-2014 22:18:06]  <IllFlower> Paper's the simplest thing to do here, really.
[01-Jun-2014 22:18:18]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Wings, yes. Costume, not unless you can describe how you're using it.
[01-Jun-2014 22:18:48]  <BGTB2005> got nothing for weaponising the costume

[01-Jun-2014 22:19:24]  <IllFlower> lol
[01-Jun-2014 22:19:34]  <Alicia> Oops.
[01-Jun-2014 22:20:28]  <ponicalica> you never know, that 2 could help you
[01-Jun-2014 22:20:29]  <ponicalica> lol
[01-Jun-2014 22:21:04]  <BGTB2005> Seeing the two at home plate, Rin pulls up from her initial path and simply decides to rain fire
[01-Jun-2014 22:21:04]  <Alicia> I'm rolling to bring the staff in. We're getting physical, so it makes sense.
[01-Jun-2014 22:21:15]  <BGTB2005> (roll for Fancy Cannon and Fire elemental?)
[01-Jun-2014 22:21:19]  <Alicia> Or, no. I'll just wait actually.
[01-Jun-2014 22:21:31]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: you could roll those in later.  Probably better to just attack with wings and 66 now
[01-Jun-2014 22:21:53]  <Alicia> ("I'll 66 you up real good, damn jerk.")
[01-Jun-2014 22:22:53]  <IllFlower> Who's the attack against?
[01-Jun-2014 22:23:11]  <BGTB2005> Michi and Mystery Girl
[01-Jun-2014 22:23:11]  <IllFlower> Might not be wise to indiscriminately rain fire considering there's a whole gaggle of people there.
[01-Jun-2014 22:23:59]  <IllFlower> ("Some people just want to watch the world burn.")
[01-Jun-2014 22:24:39]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: Then again, Rin might not care.
[01-Jun-2014 22:24:54]  <BGTB2005> I don't think Rin would take collateral damage into account, beyond not wanting to injure Minako
[01-Jun-2014 22:24:58]  <IllFlower> If you're swooping in to divebomb someone you'll have to pick just one of them, unless you can figure out a way to simultaneously divebomb two targets at a distance from each other.
[01-Jun-2014 22:25:26]  <IllFlower> All right, fire it is. Gimme some dice.
[01-Jun-2014 22:25:49]  <BGTB2005> cannon and fire elemental?
[01-Jun-2014 22:26:05]  <ponicalica> Are you using the cannon?
[01-Jun-2014 22:26:06]  <Alicia> However you choose to inflict grievous injuries.
[01-Jun-2014 22:26:29]  <IllFlower> The cannon won't really help you raise since it's d6.
[01-Jun-2014 22:26:46]  <IllFlower> You already have 666 so it won't make your raise any better.

[01-Jun-2014 22:36:45]  <IllFlower> Michi glares at Rin as she swoops in for a landing somewhere around third base.
[01-Jun-2014 22:37:15]  <Alicia> (Where is Michi located, again?)
[01-Jun-2014 22:37:20]  <IllFlower> "Are you trying to kill someone?!" she yells in indignation. "Was Tsubaki not enough?"

[01-Jun-2014 22:40:00]  <Alicia> Hikari puts on her brass knuckles and charges up to home plate. There she punches Michi in the side.

[01-Jun-2014 22:41:56]  <Alicia> @dice use 6 6
[01-Jun-2014 22:41:56]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Used 6 6 = 12. Bank now has 1 1 3 3 3 4 4 5 = 24.
[01-Jun-2014 22:42:05]  <Alicia> Or, wait.
[01-Jun-2014 22:42:30]  <Alicia> It's @dice give right? 65, not 66.
[01-Jun-2014 22:42:42]  <IllFlower> add 6, use 5
[01-Jun-2014 22:42:49]  <Alicia> @dice add 6
[01-Jun-2014 22:42:49]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Rolled 6 = 6. Bank now has 1 1 3 3 3 4 4 5 6 = 30.

[01-Jun-2014 22:42:55]  <IllFlower> 11?
[01-Jun-2014 22:43:05]  <BGTB2005> I don't think Michi was exactly expecting such a blow, though this may end up complicating things for Rin
[01-Jun-2014 22:43:38]  <Alicia> Hikari's learn to reflect/nullify fire with her staff, let's say, BGTB2005. ;)
[01-Jun-2014 22:43:56]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Er, yes?
[01-Jun-2014 22:43:58]  <ponicalica> the emdogsiverse clearly doesn't have friendly fire :p
[01-Jun-2014 22:44:23]  <Alicia> Or that I guess.
[01-Jun-2014 22:44:24]  <IllFlower> In the settling dust caused by the other girl's explosion, it's hard to judge distance, and Michi dodges a disoriented Hikari rather easily.
[01-Jun-2014 22:44:24]  <BGTB2005> it may end up resulting in Hikari also having to see
[01-Jun-2014 22:44:28]  <IllFlower> @dice use 5 6

[01-Jun-2014 22:45:01]  <IllFlower> I guess I'll have Michi go next.
[01-Jun-2014 22:45:22]  <Alicia> BGTB2005: Well, we'll also have to see where Ayako goes.
[01-Jun-2014 22:45:27]  <BGTB2005> brb, dinner
[01-Jun-2014 22:45:32]  <BGTB2005> will try to eat as fast as possible
[01-Jun-2014 22:45:40]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: can you postpone it just a few minutes
[01-Jun-2014 22:45:41]  <Alicia> Eating is for dorks.
[01-Jun-2014 22:45:46]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: by the time you get back I'll probably have to be gone, really
[01-Jun-2014 22:45:50]  <IllFlower> Eh, whatever, I got a plan.
[01-Jun-2014 22:48:08]  <IllFlower> Michi, winded from the effort of dodging Hikari and Rin's attacks, makes a quick calculation. Noticing that Ayako hasn't made it onto the field yet, Michi makes a quick incantation and tries to block her entrance.
[01-Jun-2014 22:48:13]  <IllFlower> @dice use 5

[01-Jun-2014 22:49:28]  <IllFlower> Ha. Well, I tried.
[01-Jun-2014 22:51:14]  <ponicalica> Ayako sees Michi's attempt to block and immediately makes a reflexive hand motion.  The sudden blue flash collides with the barrier and shatters it, as Ayako's costume forms around her.
[01-Jun-2014 22:51:19]  <ponicalica> @dice use 6 >! reversed the blow

[01-Jun-2014 22:52:27]  <IllFlower> Oh, good, someone's paying attention.
[01-Jun-2014 22:52:54]  <Alicia> I try, Illflower.
[01-Jun-2014 22:53:02]  <Alicia> It makes up for me Aliciaing it up. :p
[01-Jun-2014 22:53:12]  <IllFlower> Man, I really should have made one of them a sorcerer. I could have lots of extra dice right now.
[01-Jun-2014 22:53:35]  <Alicia> @__@
[01-Jun-2014 22:53:48]  <IllFlower> What a fool I was!
[01-Jun-2014 22:54:05]  <ponicalica> Ayako effortly continues her hand motion, and begins a quick incantation of her own, reflecting the force of Michi's shattered barrier back at her.
[01-Jun-2014 22:54:08]  <ponicalica> @dice use 4

[01-Jun-2014 22:55:31]  <ponicalica> How far is Michi from the other girl?  If so, it might hit her too, dunno
[01-Jun-2014 22:56:10]  <Alicia> (Times like this that Hikari should learn some sort of magic. First fire, now reflected magical barriers? Think, girl!)
[01-Jun-2014 22:56:10]  <IllFlower> Let's keep things simple.
[01-Jun-2014 22:57:29]  <IllFlower> Michi quickly dispels the barrier now that the Conservators are at close distance, nullifying the effect of Ayako's reflection as the barrier disappears into pretty sparkles(tm).

[01-Jun-2014 23:01:22]  <Alicia> Ow.
[01-Jun-2014 23:02:58]  <IllFlower> "Mori, the baseballs!" she yells to a girl in the dugout.
[01-Jun-2014 23:03:40]  <BGTB2005> "Things that go boom" In any other situation, I think Rin would probably get along nicely with Mystery Girl
[01-Jun-2014 23:03:54]  <ponicalica> well until the bullying starts
[01-Jun-2014 23:03:59]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[01-Jun-2014 23:04:17]  <BGTB2005> then Rin would attempt to make Mystery Girl the thing that goes boom
[01-Jun-2014 23:04:18]  <IllFlower> One at a time, she catches the baseballs and sets them alight in the palm of her hand, throwing them in the directions of Rin, Hikari, and Ayako. Inches from their respective positions, the balls begin to explode like grenades --
[01-Jun-2014 23:04:19]  <Alicia> ("2d10 Things that go boom" heh.)

[01-Jun-2014 23:07:45]  <IllFlower> Maybe she should run.
[01-Jun-2014 23:08:05]  <BGTB2005> would this count as dangerous magic?
[01-Jun-2014 23:08:14]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: yeah, I'm not sure if it would tbh
[01-Jun-2014 23:08:40]  <Alicia> (Idea: "Takes advantage of others" ~~~> Grabs Michi and uses her as a shield. Yes/No?)
[01-Jun-2014 23:08:48]  <Alicia> (It works in my eyes...)
[01-Jun-2014 23:09:07]  <BGTB2005> debating: should Rin attempt to shoot the baseball out of the sky or use her wings as an impromptu shield?
[01-Jun-2014 23:09:09]  <ponicalica> of course grabbing Michi means she'd be close to you
[01-Jun-2014 23:09:16]  <BGTB2005> Alicia: yyyyyyyyyy
[01-Jun-2014 23:09:47]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Well, she previously attempted to wail on her sides. I think they're already pretty close?

[01-Jun-2014 23:10:34]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Don't think you can just do that without resistance from Michi, so no.
[01-Jun-2014 23:10:44]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Mm, good point.
[01-Jun-2014 23:10:46]  <ponicalica> but yeah, I'm not sure whether or not this counts as dangerous magic
[01-Jun-2014 23:10:50]  <BGTB2005> move so that Michi's between Hikari and bomb?
[01-Jun-2014 23:11:23]  <ponicalica> I don't think that'd work in the heat of the moment really
[01-Jun-2014 23:11:50]  <Alicia> Rolling for the staff, since it could be used offensively or defensively.

[01-Jun-2014 23:13:16]  <IllFlower> We're running it close, so after this round we'll put this on hold to resume next time.
[01-Jun-2014 23:13:23]  <Alicia> Yes.

[01-Jun-2014 23:14:22]  <BGTB2005> Watching the burning baseball approach, Rin decides nothing good could come from it, so she returns to the air before it lands

[01-Jun-2014 23:14:53]  <ponicalica> also that's probably not Rin's bag

[01-Jun-2014 23:16:11]  <ponicalica> Alicia: you'd have to use, e.g. 651

[01-Jun-2014 23:16:24]  <IllFlower> 3d10 fallout?
[01-Jun-2014 23:16:27]  <ponicalica> and I guess Hikari would probably try to help Ayako
[01-Jun-2014 23:16:31]  <BGTB2005> ouch
[01-Jun-2014 23:16:54]  <IllFlower> I would've thought Ayako would try to save Hikari.
[01-Jun-2014 23:17:01]  <Alicia> Oh yeah, that makes 3d10...
[01-Jun-2014 23:17:07]  <IllFlower> Well, maybe. She's overmatched and she's presumably not as suicidal as Jun was.
[01-Jun-2014 23:17:11]  <BGTB2005> good luck :<
[01-Jun-2014 23:17:48]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Are you taking the fallout, then?
[01-Jun-2014 23:17:51]  <ponicalica> Hmm, true.  I guess the question is, how much is her annoyance over Rin rushing things and distrust of Rin's actions versus her sort of thinking of Jun
[01-Jun-2014 23:18:04]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Well, what's the other option.
[01-Jun-2014 23:18:09]  <IllFlower> Giving.
[01-Jun-2014 23:18:15]  <ponicalica> Or having me lend a die
[01-Jun-2014 23:18:25]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Are you up for that, or no.
[01-Jun-2014 23:18:33]  <IllFlower> That as well. Though that'd put Ayako in an even worse position than she's in now.
[01-Jun-2014 23:18:38]  <BGTB2005> Deep down, Rin (hopefully) cares about the well-being of her comrades, but she'll still look after herself first after a bad experience trying to play hero
[01-Jun-2014 23:18:43]  <Alicia> Yes...
[01-Jun-2014 23:19:21]  <Alicia> Shoot. It's give or risk death.
[01-Jun-2014 23:19:27]  <ponicalica> Alicia: I'm up for it if you think Hikari wouldn't...actually
[01-Jun-2014 23:19:33]  <IllFlower> Well, maybe not Hikari's death.
[01-Jun-2014 23:19:33]  <BGTB2005> Rin will avenge you
[01-Jun-2014 23:19:40]  <ponicalica> well, do you think Hikari would be more likely to block Ayako or Ayako Hikari
[01-Jun-2014 23:19:43]  <ponicalica> or both
[01-Jun-2014 23:20:24]  <ponicalica> the thing about both is that it leaves us at a disadvantage next round
[01-Jun-2014 23:20:37]  <IllFlower> Ayako's taking 3d10 to see either way.
[01-Jun-2014 23:20:58]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: even if Hikari lends a die?
[01-Jun-2014 23:21:06]  <IllFlower> Oh, no, you're right.
[01-Jun-2014 23:21:11]  <IllFlower> You could help each other, haha.
[01-Jun-2014 23:21:22]  <Alicia> ponicalica: I lend you 1 and you lend me 1?
[01-Jun-2014 23:21:30]  <Alicia> Or, whatever you need.
[01-Jun-2014 23:21:34]  <ponicalica> you'd have to lend me 4 I think but yeah, lol
[01-Jun-2014 23:21:34]  <IllFlower> This would leave you in a woeful position on your raises, but whatever.
[01-Jun-2014 23:21:40]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Ayako needs a 4.
[01-Jun-2014 23:21:53]  <Alicia> Welp.
[01-Jun-2014 23:21:59]  <IllFlower> OT six minutes!
[01-Jun-2014 23:22:11]  <ponicalica> actually, might as well do this
[01-Jun-2014 23:22:23]  <ponicalica> or, would light even be effective, lol
[01-Jun-2014 23:22:34]  <BGTB2005> If Michi's close to Hikari, would she also have to see or are we not factoring in friendly fire?
[01-Jun-2014 23:22:42]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: Not seeing it.
[01-Jun-2014 23:22:50]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: magic /handwave
[01-Jun-2014 23:23:05]  <Alicia> @dice roll 2d6
[01-Jun-2014 23:23:05]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Rolled 1 4 = 5.
[01-Jun-2014 23:23:14]  <IllFlower> Let's not complicate this more than it's already gotten.
[01-Jun-2014 23:23:16]  <IllFlower> Alicia: ?
[01-Jun-2014 23:23:21]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Costume.
[01-Jun-2014 23:23:37]  <IllFlower> "add"
[01-Jun-2014 23:23:45]  <IllFlower> Also gotta explain how it's useful.
[01-Jun-2014 23:23:50]  <ponicalica> Actually I'm not sure that Ayako has the ability to really do much to shield Hikari.
[01-Jun-2014 23:24:06]  <IllFlower> In general you should mention what you're rolling and why before you actually do it.
[01-Jun-2014 23:24:14]  <Alicia> Right, sorry.
[01-Jun-2014 23:24:30]  <IllFlower> In future I might discount unexplained rolls. Or maybe just the good ones. ;)
[01-Jun-2014 23:24:32]  <ponicalica> and I think for costume it's more a magical shiled thing
[01-Jun-2014 23:24:47]  <BGTB2005> like body armour or something
[01-Jun-2014 23:24:48]  <Alicia> I was thinking of rolling for the transformation since there's the whole dramatic energy burs,t but uh 14 is not good.
[01-Jun-2014 23:25:08]  <ponicalica> But yeah, Hikari's using her staff to deflect things but I don't see what Ayako's doing tbh
[01-Jun-2014 23:25:09]  <BGTB2005> the dice are trying to kill you
[01-Jun-2014 23:25:15]  <Alicia> Indeed so.
[01-Jun-2014 23:25:18]  <IllFlower> Okay, so right now Hikari's taking 3d10 fallout and Ayako hasn't done anything yet. Hurry if you want to change that!
[01-Jun-2014 23:25:28]  <IllFlower> ponicalica needs to leave in literally five minutes!
[01-Jun-2014 23:25:34]  <IllFlower> THE CLOCK WANTS TO KILL YOU
[01-Jun-2014 23:26:18]  <BGTB2005> @dice show IllFlower 
[01-Jun-2014 23:26:18]  <Omnipresence> 14BGTB2005: Bank has 1 2 2 2 3 3 = 13.
[01-Jun-2014 23:26:37]  <IllFlower> HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME
[01-Jun-2014 23:27:06]  <ponicalica> Ayako tries to twist away from the path of the balls, and use magic to push them back, but they were too sudden for her to do any real preparing, and so the explosions would probably hit way too close for safety but for the timely intervention of Hikari's thrown staff
[01-Jun-2014 23:27:10]  <ponicalica> is this okay with you, Alicia?
[01-Jun-2014 23:27:38]  <Alicia> Yes, it is.
[01-Jun-2014 23:27:41]  <ponicalica> @dice use 4 4
[01-Jun-2014 23:27:41]  <Omnipresence> 14ponicalica: Used 4 4 = 8. Bank now has 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 4 = 18.
[01-Jun-2014 23:27:48]  <ponicalica> and I am literally off now
[01-Jun-2014 23:27:54]  <IllFlower> Alicia presumably lends a 4.
[01-Jun-2014 23:28:01]  <Alicia> @dice use 4
[01-Jun-2014 23:28:01]  <Omnipresence> 14Alicia: Used 4 = 4. Bank now has 1 2 3 3 3 4 = 16.
[01-Jun-2014 23:28:06]  <IllFlower> Okay, we'll pick up next week. Thanks for playing, all.
[01-Jun-2014 23:28:28]  <IllFlower> @dice > Michi
[01-Jun-2014 23:28:28]  <Omnipresence> 14Michi: Bank has 1 2 2 2 3 3 = 13.
[01-Jun-2014 23:28:37]  <IllFlower> Other girl has 111222233.
[01-Jun-2014 23:28:43]  <BGTB2005> @dice > Rin
[01-Jun-2014 23:28:43]  <Omnipresence> 14Rin: Bank has 1 1 1 1 2 3 3 3 5 = 20.
[01-Jun-2014 23:28:56]  <IllFlower> @dice show Alicia > Hikari ! plus 3d10 fallout.
[01-Jun-2014 23:28:56]  <Omnipresence> 14Hikari: Bank has 1 2 3 3 3 4 = 16.
[01-Jun-2014 23:29:02]  <IllFlower> @dice show ponicalica > Ayako
[01-Jun-2014 23:29:02]  <Omnipresence> 14Ayako: Bank has 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 4 = 18.
[01-Jun-2014 23:29:20]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | EMDOGS: Sat 4/1p, as usual
[01-Jun-2014 23:30:07]  <BGTB2005> She probably doesn't need them but next session, I'm thinking of rolling the 2d6  for "If it doesn't work, add more" (launch fire at Mystery Girl again) and the d4+d6 for the fancy cannon (precision fire)
[01-Jun-2014 23:30:11]  <Alicia> Hikari reacts as quickly as she can, making it just in time to throw her staff towards Ayako. For herself, she creates transforms while bracing for impact.
[01-Jun-2014 23:30:22]  <Alicia> she creates her costume*
