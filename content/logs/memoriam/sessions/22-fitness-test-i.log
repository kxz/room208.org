@time=2014-06-01T20:05:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right. When we left off, Shii had just given Rin a talking-to.
@time=2014-06-01T20:05:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Before that, Ayako and Hikari had just ferreted out some potentially useful information from Michi.
@time=2014-06-01T20:06:08.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That Yumiko's dad was probably yakuza, and the whole "bond" thing she has going on, yeah?
@time=2014-06-01T20:06:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What next? I believe there was some interest in talking to Yumiko, along with the little unresolved detail of the fitness test.
@time=2014-06-01T20:06:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Bond? James Bond?
@time=2014-06-01T20:06:46.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :er, maybe not bond was the word she used
@time=2014-06-01T20:07:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, the "banding together" thing?
@time=2014-06-01T20:07:32.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-06-01T20:07:32.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :lol
@time=2014-06-01T20:07:35.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("welcoming her into the group"?)
@time=2014-06-01T20:07:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's just a party with some tea and cake, obviously.
@time=2014-06-01T20:08:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, if memory serves we wanted to chat with Yumiko and see what's up with the "fitness test."
@time=2014-06-01T20:08:16.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not sure if there was anything else.
@time=2014-06-01T20:09:03.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think those were the main things.
@time=2014-06-01T20:09:15.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Do y'all remember what you wanted to ask Yumiko?
@time=2014-06-01T20:09:45.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :No. >_>;
@time=2014-06-01T20:09:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Feel free to set the scene.
@time=2014-06-01T20:10:05.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :...I'll think of something to ask?
@time=2014-06-01T20:10:14.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Couldn't hurt to ask her about the test, though? Unless it could hurt, heheh.
@time=2014-06-01T20:10:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'll just be here eating potato chips.
@time=2014-06-01T20:10:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: well, it could bring back some traumatic memories, maybe
@time=2014-06-01T20:11:18.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: True. Not sure if indirectly asking about Michi would be any more helpful than last time...
@time=2014-06-01T20:13:08.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: yeah.  It might be good just to skip to the fitness test, really, unless you or BGTB2005  has a specific question.
@time=2014-06-01T20:13:19.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't think so, really.
@time=2014-06-01T20:13:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There was the thing with her family.
@time=2014-06-01T20:13:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Although, hey, it can't hurt to check in and see how she's feeling.
@time=2014-06-01T20:14:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("Didn't you get reprimanded for-" "I don't want to hurt you. >:|")
@time=2014-06-01T20:15:09.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeaah, sounds good.
@time=2014-06-01T20:15:37.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, a quick check-up sounds like a good idea
@time=2014-06-01T20:16:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Then let's do that.
@time=2014-06-01T20:17:01.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The three Conservators head towards the room in which Yumiko has been held for the past however long(days?), relieving whatever rookie Conservator had been assigned to this job of duty.
@time=2014-06-01T20:17:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She's in one of the church's many small group rooms, playing a rather old video game on a rather old television. She's been staying home from school, taking advantage of the hierarchy's massive absence excuse machine.
@time=2014-06-01T20:17:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's an old machine that throws up clouds of smoke whenever it needs to craft an excuse, but I digress.
@time=2014-06-01T20:17:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(She's a smart girl.)
@time=2014-06-01T20:18:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Presumably one of the Conservators says "hi" or something.
@time=2014-06-01T20:19:03.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari walks up and pats Yumiko on the shoulder "Hey, Hikari here. Have you been feeling any better?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:20:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("HEY HIKARI HERE FOR OXI-CLEAN")
@time=2014-06-01T20:20:27.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :pffff
@time=2014-06-01T20:20:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha.
@time=2014-06-01T20:21:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hm?" Yumiko sets aside the controller, and thus her quest to become the greatest farmer in town, for a moment. "Oh, hi.
@time=2014-06-01T20:22:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm doing fine. Haven't jumped off any roofs today." She laughs hesitantly at her own joke.
@time=2014-06-01T20:24:02.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That's good.  Has your magic felt, uh, out of control recently?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:24:49.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari chuckles back the best she can. "Well, at least you're safe here, it sounds like." She scans the room, noting pleasantly, how utterly mundane it is.
@time=2014-06-01T20:25:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(By which I mean, nothing's destroooyed.)
@time=2014-06-01T20:25:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well, I haven't really had a reason to use it now, have I?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:26:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yumiko shrugs. "Everything's under control if it doesn't do anything."
@time=2014-06-01T20:26:20.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(>_>)
@time=2014-06-01T20:26:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako whispers to Hikari for confirmation, probably loud enough for a sound mage like Yumiko to hear it: "What was that you found in Michi's dorm again: fitness test?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:27:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Probably loud enough?
@time=2014-06-01T20:27:45.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :i.e. not quiet enough, I dunno
@time=2014-06-01T20:27:47.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She nods. "But do you want to ask..?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:27:48.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness ::V
@time=2014-06-01T20:27:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Are you hint-hinting me?
@time=2014-06-01T20:27:59.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :maybe?
@time=2014-06-01T20:28:15.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: Yeah, I'm getting you to force my hand on my indecisiveness
@time=2014-06-01T20:28:15.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I assume Rin is glaring at the happy farm on the screen.
@time=2014-06-01T20:30:50.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It might be good.  I mean, if this is a common thing for new initiates, presumably she'd know about it..."
@time=2014-06-01T20:31:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What are you guys whispering about?" Yumiko asks, tilting her head in confusion.
@time=2014-06-01T20:31:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("I said, with a posed look")
@time=2014-06-01T20:32:34.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Uh, do the words «fitness test» mean anything to you?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:34:35.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We found out about one coming up soon when gathering information, and it... seems fairly important."
@time=2014-06-01T20:34:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You mean Akase's little ritual?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:34:46.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("We? You were the one scavenging!")
@time=2014-06-01T20:34:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yumiko's expression darkens a bit.
@time=2014-06-01T20:37:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah, I've heard her talk about it. I've never been part of one, though.
@time=2014-06-01T20:38:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She keeps insisting that I need to go through one to really be part of the group, but I don't see why I should have to do something like that. I'm already part of the group just by having the same familiar, no?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:39:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She bites her lip, falling silent.
@time=2014-06-01T20:40:11.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well, there are supposed to be things that can deepen the bond between initiates.  Hikari, I think we might need to see this «fitness test» for ourselves."
@time=2014-06-01T20:41:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin's just chopped liver, apparently.
@time=2014-06-01T20:42:02.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Agreed, Ayako." She looks back to Yumiko. "But I'm curious, do you know from other initiates what the test might entail? Or has she kept in entirely under wraps?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:42:11.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I realized that after I said it that I forgot her name, but considering what happened I think it works as passive-aggressiveness, so
@time=2014-06-01T20:42:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Just imagining Rin also broke an earring other something, heh.)
@time=2014-06-01T20:44:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I don't think it's a secret. I just haven't asked."
@time=2014-06-01T20:46:51.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Did you get a look at any of the others after their tests?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:48:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"No. I've been the newest one for a while now.
@time=2014-06-01T20:48:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well, no, I take that back. There's another girl who just initiated. I don't remember her name, though, and I don't think she's been through her test yet."
@time=2014-06-01T20:53:14.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And did Akari and her group ostracize you for not participating?"
@time=2014-06-01T20:53:28.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Akari? lol
@time=2014-06-01T20:53:39.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Did I... say a wrong thing.
@time=2014-06-01T20:53:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Fuck.
@time=2014-06-01T20:53:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sorry.
@time=2014-06-01T20:53:57.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Akase*
@time=2014-06-01T20:54:03.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yes i believe you horrifically mangled someone's name
@time=2014-06-01T20:54:10.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes I know okay. ;-;
@time=2014-06-01T20:54:16.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :whatever, you meant Michi Akase, now Yumiko's going to be confused for a short bit before she realizes
@time=2014-06-01T20:54:27.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Sorry, Akase."
@time=2014-06-01T20:54:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Akari was a different girl.
@time=2014-06-01T20:54:35.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :>_<
@time=2014-06-01T20:54:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's okay. Hikari wouldn't have known her.
@time=2014-06-01T20:55:55.000Z :SpruceZeus PART #madokamadness
@time=2014-06-01T20:56:40.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :i don't even remember which girl akari was :V
@time=2014-06-01T20:57:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Something like that. They certainly don't go out of their way to talk to me."
@time=2014-06-01T20:57:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Kei's friend. She mostly cried.
@time=2014-06-01T20:58:02.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :oh right, emburst, lol
@time=2014-06-01T21:00:46.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Does Alicia or BGTB2005 have anything else to ask?
@time=2014-06-01T21:00:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, anything else? Make popcorn, raze Yumiko's farms, something like that?
@time=2014-06-01T21:00:47.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Certainly doesn't help that Nyoma seems so spacey, I'm sure. Do you know the new girl's name, by the way? Or any identifying features?"
@time=2014-06-01T21:01:07.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm pretty sure only one of us would raze her farms. It would not end well.
@time=2014-06-01T21:01:16.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :only if provoked
@time=2014-06-01T21:01:30.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alicia: it's on the paper you saw iirc
@time=2014-06-01T21:01:33.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :also: 'I don't remember her name, though'
@time=2014-06-01T21:01:39.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ack right.
@time=2014-06-01T21:01:52.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :identifying features would be good though
@time=2014-06-01T21:01:53.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Cut: All but features.
@time=2014-06-01T21:01:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :>_<
@time=2014-06-01T21:02:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She's young, I remember that much. I think she said she just started high school.
@time=2014-06-01T21:02:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She seemed very earnest. To be honest, I'm a little worried, but..."
@time=2014-06-01T21:02:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yumiko trails off.
@time=2014-06-01T21:05:38.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Then we have more cause for concern." Hikari faces the other two. "Either of you take issue with us heading out now?"
@time=2014-06-01T21:05:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Is it Saturday yet?
@time=2014-06-01T21:06:09.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well, we can't do much until the fitness test is actually being set up."
@time=2014-06-01T21:06:15.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :If it's not, we'll just setup camp and wait it out.
@time=2014-06-01T21:06:17.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(I kid.)
@time=2014-06-01T21:06:19.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But yeah, OOC, let's skip to the fitness test
@time=2014-06-01T21:06:51.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mhm.
@time=2014-06-01T21:07:00.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :sure
@time=2014-06-01T21:07:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :TIME WARP
@time=2014-06-01T21:08:15.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ACTION imagines the Teleglitch noises.
@time=2014-06-01T21:08:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The Conservators make their way out in front of the Takami High School campus about an hour before the fitness test is scheduled.
@time=2014-06-01T21:08:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It doesn't look like anyone's around yet, which gives them time to formulate a plan of attack.
@time=2014-06-01T21:10:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And that plan is... /drumroll
@time=2014-06-01T21:11:20.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Definitely not punching Akase the second we see her.
@time=2014-06-01T21:11:24.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :...what plan?
@time=2014-06-01T21:12:49.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe something like what we did the first arc where we hide in order to see where Michi et al are going?
@time=2014-06-01T21:14:18.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"So, Ayako, Rin, what plans do you have in mind? There's always tailing them, or waiting and listening, to see if they mentioned important locations."
@time=2014-06-01T21:15:00.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Then we can watch them there..." she trails off, unsure.
@time=2014-06-01T21:15:31.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Wait, listen, and observe."
@time=2014-06-01T21:15:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :They mentioned here. It's what was in Michi's notebook.
@time=2014-06-01T21:17:18.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I assumed that was, like, the initial meeting. Because [worst possible testy thing] in a schoolyard seems :v
@time=2014-06-01T21:17:23.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ACTION is assuming, bluh.
@time=2014-06-01T21:17:48.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was thinking, like, they'll set up something to do the fitness test with, and maybe we could hear them saying plans?  I dunno
@time=2014-06-01T21:19:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We gonna stake this thing out?
@time=2014-06-01T21:19:40.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"At least it's not a riverbank," Rin mutters
@time=2014-06-01T21:19:48.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I guess?
@time=2014-06-01T21:20:29.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Locate the nearest bush.
@time=2014-06-01T21:20:42.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :or tree
@time=2014-06-01T21:21:08.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: yeah that's basiaclly where I was going, yeah
@time=2014-06-01T21:21:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, there is an entire school building you could probably conceal yourselves in.
@time=2014-06-01T21:22:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hope you guys brought a pair of binoculars.
@time=2014-06-01T21:23:40.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari has a few in her Great Bag of Everything, right?
@time=2014-06-01T21:23:49.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-06-01T21:24:14.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari shuffles around in her bag, taking out three pairs of binoculars and a sandwich, passing them out. "If you don't want them now, you can take them home, if you want."

@time=2014-06-01T21:24:37.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :just one sandwich?
@time=2014-06-01T21:24:50.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We have to go light.

@time=2014-06-01T23:24:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In future I might discount unexplained rolls. Or maybe just the good ones. ;)
@time=2014-06-01T23:24:32.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :and I think for costume it's more a magical shiled thing
@time=2014-06-01T23:24:47.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :like body armour or something
@time=2014-06-01T23:24:48.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was thinking of rolling for the transformation since there's the whole dramatic energy burs,t but uh 14 is not good.
@time=2014-06-01T23:25:08.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But yeah, Hikari's using her staff to deflect things but I don't see what Ayako's doing tbh
@time=2014-06-01T23:25:09.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the dice are trying to kill you
@time=2014-06-01T23:25:15.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Indeed so.
@time=2014-06-01T23:25:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, so right now Hikari's taking 3d10 fallout and Ayako hasn't done anything yet. Hurry if you want to change that!

@time=2014-06-01T23:27:06.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako tries to twist away from the path of the balls, and use magic to push them back, but they were too sudden for her to do any real preparing, and so the explosions would probably hit way too close for safety but for the timely intervention of Hikari's thrown staff
@time=2014-06-01T23:27:10.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :is this okay with you, Alicia?

@time=2014-06-01T23:30:07.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She probably doesn't need them but next session, I'm thinking of rolling the 2d6  for "If it doesn't work, add more" (launch fire at Mystery Girl again) and the d4+d6 for the fancy cannon (precision fire)
@time=2014-06-01T23:30:11.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari reacts as quickly as she can, making it just in time to throw her staff towards Ayako. For herself, she creates transforms while bracing for impact.
@time=2014-06-01T23:30:22.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she creates her costume*
