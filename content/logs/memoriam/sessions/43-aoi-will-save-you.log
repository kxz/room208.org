@time=2015-06-13T22:57:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, I don't know what you'd want out of the conflict, so someone set that scene.
@time=2015-06-13T22:58:24.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think we want her to give up her connections to Naoki as well as stop forging etc
@time=2015-06-13T22:58:47.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that'd be ideal. Getting her to spill on Naoki would be good.
@time=2015-06-13T22:59:06.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Should I lead us in if that's what we're going for?
@time=2015-06-13T22:59:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, let's start the scene and we'll go to conflict once we hit conflict-y things.

@time=2015-06-13T23:07:07.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki smiles and tries not to alarm her. "We were hoping we could take a look to find out."

@time=2015-06-13T23:09:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Murata's eyes flick from Kazuki to Ayako and back.
@time=2015-06-13T23:09:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She finally hands the stack of parchment over.
@time=2015-06-13T23:10:02.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki takes a look at the parchment, checking to see if it does indeed match the events at the meeting.
@time=2015-06-13T23:10:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It doesn't take long for him to notice that the very first item of business, the moratorium, is missing.

@time=2015-06-13T23:11:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not that he can see.
@time=2015-06-13T23:11:25.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think the missing first item is kind of a higher priority?

@time=2015-06-13T23:12:21.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, the fact that someone who probably isn't a prophet is on these lists is pretty strong evidence already
@time=2015-06-13T23:12:32.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kazuki frowns and passes the parchment to Ayako. "Were you at the meeting, Murata?"
@time=2015-06-13T23:12:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"As before. I am only their courier."
@time=2015-06-13T23:13:28.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako continues to look through the parchment as Kazuki engages Murata.

@time=2015-06-13T23:14:21.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I can tell you that these transcripts aren't accurate. And perhaps it would surprise you to find out that your name is in previous transcripts of these meetings as a voting member of Consilium Renascens?"
