@time=2014-05-11T22:05:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, roll call!
@time=2014-05-11T22:05:47.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Here.
@time=2014-05-11T22:06:03.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ready
@time=2014-05-11T22:06:11.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :here
@time=2014-05-11T22:06:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, we left off last time having just talked to Nyoma.
@time=2014-05-11T22:06:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I recall you guys wanted to go see Michi.
@time=2014-05-11T22:07:12.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I believe so.
@time=2014-05-11T22:07:20.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yes.
@time=2014-05-11T22:07:30.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yep
@time=2014-05-11T22:08:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Then why don't we do that?
@time=2014-05-11T22:10:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Nyoma suggested looking for her in her university dorm, so the Conservators get together in a nearby park in the afternoon and put heads together on what to do from there.
@time=2014-05-11T22:11:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There's always the option of just all showing up on her doorstep, but that didn't work out so well the last time the girls tried that, so maybe another strategy might be warranted...
@time=2014-05-11T22:12:55.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, I think Rin might be okay with that, but she has other goals...
@time=2014-05-11T22:14:15.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Ayako, Rin, what ideas do you have for contacting Michi? I was thinking, we could always tail her until an opportune situation presents itself."
@time=2014-05-11T22:14:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin's always about knocking down doors, apparently.
@time=2014-05-11T22:14:26.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not much is coming to mind.  In the "terrible ideas" department there's "wait until she leaves the dorm and then start talking" but...
@time=2014-05-11T22:16:06.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Tracking her sounds good."
@time=2014-05-11T22:16:24.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hmm.  Maybe that would work.  Presumably she'll have some events or leave to get food or something..."
@time=2014-05-11T22:16:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So what's the plan here?
@time=2014-05-11T22:17:40.000Z :KogasakaYou NICK AttObl
@time=2014-05-11T22:17:51.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :probably just wait for her to leave the building and follow her or something.  Alicia, BGTB2005?
@time=2014-05-11T22:17:57.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari nods. "Of course, we can't underestimate her at all, but... that's all I've got. And it's better than knocking on doors, I think."
@time=2014-05-11T22:18:02.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: Yerp.
@time=2014-05-11T22:18:27.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Only other alternative I can think of involves kicking her door in."
@time=2014-05-11T22:18:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno what you'd accomplish by following her around, other than maybe creeping her out.
@time=2014-05-11T22:18:51.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :gathering intel
@time=2014-05-11T22:19:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What are you after, though?
@time=2014-05-11T22:19:38.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Probably what form the "tormenting" takes.
@time=2014-05-11T22:19:42.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe she'll meet her circle of friends?
@time=2014-05-11T22:19:45.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The goal is to find out what she's done to Yumiko. It seems ideal if we can get her when she's alone.
@time=2014-05-11T22:20:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The girls hang around the park for a little while, keeping an eye on the door to Michi's room.
@time=2014-05-11T22:21:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :After waiting for about an hour and a half, during which a couple of coffee and bathroom runs are made, someone finally emerges into the hallway.
@time=2014-05-11T22:23:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's Michi, no doubt, though her hair's quite a bit longer these days than it is in the picture the Conservators were given.
@time=2014-05-11T22:24:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She walks down the stairs and out onto the street facing the park. There's a bag slung over her shoulder, one that looks like something any college student might have.
@time=2014-05-11T22:25:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's clear she hasn't bothered to lock the door to her room. It's a fairly safe neighborhood, to be fair, but...
@time=2014-05-11T22:25:22.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Reminds me. In my mind, Hikari carried around a pack or something, too.)
@time=2014-05-11T22:25:46.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, of course she does.  Gotta keep the brass knuckles, the handcuffs, and the water bottles somewhere...
@time=2014-05-11T22:25:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahahaha.
@time=2014-05-11T22:26:05.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Heheheh, well, yeah.)
@time=2014-05-11T22:26:08.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(hikari go loot the place)
@time=2014-05-11T22:26:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, the opportunity to look around while she's gone has presented itself. What say you?
@time=2014-05-11T22:27:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, what is there to gain from it? It certainly sounds interesting, but I'm not sold on the idea.
@time=2014-05-11T22:27:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She might have records of something relating to her magical dealings.
@time=2014-05-11T22:27:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Your potential information sources aren't constantly moving, for one. ;)
@time=2014-05-11T22:29:20.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hm, good points.
@time=2014-05-11T22:29:31.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also, Rin's less likely to punch Michi's belongings.
@time=2014-05-11T22:29:56.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-05-11T22:30:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Just as long as Rin doesn't take her aggression out on her belongings. :p
@time=2014-05-11T22:31:02.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Though, let's hope we don't repeat what happened last time we investigated...)
@time=2014-05-11T22:31:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So you guys are going to head in?
@time=2014-05-11T22:31:32.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah.  Let's head in.
@time=2014-05-11T22:31:33.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(who knows, we might meet her friends)
@time=2014-05-11T22:32:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Once Michi is out of sight, the girls steal across the screet and into Michi's dorm building.
@time=2014-05-11T22:32:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Strategy here? One of you want to be a lookout or something?
@time=2014-05-11T22:33:10.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin, perhaps?
@time=2014-05-11T22:33:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Actually, this is a role-playing game. You guys work it out. :p
@time=2014-05-11T22:33:22.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :On the other hand, Rin as a lookout would be a bad idea
@time=2014-05-11T22:33:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Because she'd punch Michi if she came back?
@time=2014-05-11T22:33:45.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :exactly
@time=2014-05-11T22:33:58.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not if she kept her jets cooled.
@time=2014-05-11T22:33:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Who's the least likely to punch someone, then? Ayako?
@time=2014-05-11T22:34:05.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Probably, lol
@time=2014-05-11T22:34:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But don't you remember what happened last time Ayako was on the outside? D:
@time=2014-05-11T22:34:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :This is true.
@time=2014-05-11T22:34:45.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh God.
@time=2014-05-11T22:34:48.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(not seeing the downside to Rin punching Michi)
@time=2014-05-11T22:34:48.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe it should be Hikari.
@time=2014-05-11T22:34:58.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari could talk them to death.
@time=2014-05-11T22:35:34.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or at least talk her to let Rin and Ayako make an exit.
@time=2014-05-11T22:35:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, either way, you guys should describe exactly what's happening. Details are important.
@time=2014-05-11T22:35:54.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Would probably involve less investigating than Rin punching people to death
@time=2014-05-11T22:35:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let's say they're at the foot of the building stairwell. So...
@time=2014-05-11T22:36:46.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako walks up the stairs and towards the room.  "Rin, you follow me.  Hikari, you look out for Michi.  Do something magical as she gets close."
@time=2014-05-11T22:36:57.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(>Hikari >magical)
@time=2014-05-11T22:37:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"'Do something magical,' she said. 'It'll be okay,' she said."
@time=2014-05-11T22:37:20.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She or the campus police, I guess, really."
@time=2014-05-11T22:38:02.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'll see what I can do, Ayako. You two be careful, please."
@time=2014-05-11T22:38:14.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(you can never be too careful with the Territorial Authority)
@time=2014-05-11T22:38:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako and Rin head up the stairs, then. Michi's room is on the third floor.
@time=2014-05-11T22:38:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's one of those buildings with a central staircase and two apartments opening onto every landing.
@time=2014-05-11T22:39:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Soon enough, the two girls are in front of the door to room 301. And the door to room 302, but that's not important.
@time=2014-05-11T22:40:00.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Do fire alarms count as magical.)
@time=2014-05-11T22:40:30.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Technically no but that'll work too, as long as they don't trigger sprinklers.  If they do, you'll piss off Rin more than she already is.)
@time=2014-05-11T22:40:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Do you knock? Kick the door from its hinges and storm in? Just open the door and walk in?
@time=2014-05-11T22:41:04.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's unlocked, but I guess there might indeed be more than one person in there.
@time=2014-05-11T22:41:07.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :hmm
@time=2014-05-11T22:41:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Good, good.)
@time=2014-05-11T22:41:09.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Rin votes to kick the door in)
@time=2014-05-11T22:41:37.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kicking might cause unnecessary alarm, though.
@time=2014-05-11T22:41:47.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also it'd be way obvious what happened when Michi comes back
@time=2014-05-11T22:42:27.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And that.
@time=2014-05-11T22:42:44.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We could just open the door, and hope Michi doesn't have a roommate in there watching porn or something.  ("Too bad Hikari's not here, she'd enjoy this.")
@time=2014-05-11T22:42:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What's the call?
@time=2014-05-11T22:43:22.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako gives two knocks on the door, and then, assuming nobody responds, simply opens it and walks in.  If someone is there, welp...
@time=2014-05-11T22:43:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Just a second!" someone calls from inside the room.
@time=2014-05-11T22:44:01.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Oh my gosh, pony.)
@time=2014-05-11T22:44:33.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Rin elects to punch 'em in the face)
@time=2014-05-11T22:44:48.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(later, though)
@time=2014-05-11T22:44:50.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(probably)
@time=2014-05-11T22:45:00.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(As long as you do it nicely.)
@time=2014-05-11T22:45:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Before Ayako or Rin can think of what to do next, the door opens, revealing a short-haired girl about Michi's age. She's dressed incredibly casually, with just a long-sleeved shirt over a pair of shorts.
@time=2014-05-11T22:45:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That was fast, Mi--" the girl says, before stopping short.

@time=2014-05-11T22:46:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Uh..." she finally stutters. "Can I help you?"
@time=2014-05-11T22:47:33.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"This is Michi Akase's room, right?"
@time=2014-05-11T22:47:50.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also, does anything pop out about the room from what we can see from the opened door?
@time=2014-05-11T22:48:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rin, peeking out from behind Ayako, realizes that she recognizes the girl's face.
@time=2014-05-11T22:48:44.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("It was...................KAEDE!")
@time=2014-05-11T22:48:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She can't recall her name or who exactly she is, but something rises in her chest...
@time=2014-05-11T22:49:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Um, uh, yeah," the girl continues. "She just went out to buy dinner. Are you looking for her?"
@time=2014-05-11T22:51:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :ponicalica: The girl's blocking the doorway, so it's hard to see anything in particular behind her.
@time=2014-05-11T22:51:56.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari, meanwhile, idly watches people pass by.
@time=2014-05-11T22:52:26.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah, we're in a math class with her, and we slept in today, so she said she was willing to let us look at her notes.  Do you think you could let us in so we could grab them for a sec?"
@time=2014-05-11T22:53:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Isn't Ayako, like, 16?
@time=2014-05-11T22:53:34.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(does the other girl recognise Rin?)
@time=2014-05-11T22:53:37.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There are sixteen year olds in college classes!
@time=2014-05-11T22:53:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: Nope.
@time=2014-05-11T22:53:47.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(and I don't think the other girl knows that)
@time=2014-05-11T22:53:49.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: probably not; for her, it was tuesday
@time=2014-05-11T22:54:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, but Michi's pretty obviously in her early twenties.
@time=2014-05-11T22:54:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, whatever.
@time=2014-05-11T22:54:43.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh sheesh,

@time=2014-05-11T22:54:55.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ayako's a bright girl.  I think it's possible. :P
@time=2014-05-11T22:55:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The girl gives Ayako an odd look. "Math?"
@time=2014-05-11T22:55:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She rubs her forehead. "Math, huh?" she says to herself. "Kinda suspicious..."
@time=2014-05-11T22:56:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :After a moment, she looks up, and suddenly asks, "What's with her?"

@time=2014-05-11T22:57:13.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It wouldn't be unreasonable for Rin to suddenly try to tackle this girl to the ground, from what I understand about Rin, but...
@time=2014-05-11T22:57:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :By which she means Rin, who's looking pretty agitated.

@time=2014-05-12T02:56:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She turns for a moment to Tsubaki, making sure that she can stand, before addressing Ayako again.
@time=2014-05-12T02:57:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm Michi Akase, by the way."
@time=2014-05-12T02:59:47.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Ayako Minakami.  Nice to meet you, even if the circumstances aren't...ideal..."
@time=2014-05-12T03:00:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You can say that again."
@time=2014-05-12T03:00:39.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :where is Hikari in all this btw
@time=2014-05-12T03:01:08.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Looking behind Ayako to make sure she doesn't return.
@time=2014-05-12T03:01:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Outside. I'm guessing Michi didn't notice her until she'd already stepped out of the apartment.
@time=2014-05-12T03:02:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm going to take her to the hospital," Michi says. "Her" meaning Tsubaki, of course.
@time=2014-05-12T03:02:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She pulls her keys out of her bag and locks the apartment door behind her, no small feat considering she has another girl limply hanging onto her.
@time=2014-05-12T03:02:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Do you want to come with us? Just to be safe."
@time=2014-05-12T03:03:08.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hmm, that might be a good idea.  Hikari, what do you think?"
@time=2014-05-12T03:03:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari might want to make sure Rin doesn't explode.
@time=2014-05-12T03:04:10.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hikari walks over, after thoroughly checking around them. "I think that's fine. I'll... keep an eye out, though."
@time=2014-05-12T03:04:22.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She pointedly glances back once more.
@time=2014-05-12T03:04:49.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Are you fine, though?"
@time=2014-05-12T03:05:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah, I'm okay. The hospital's not far from here. We should be able to walk there. Even Tsubaki."
@time=2014-05-12T03:05:53.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I think I can make it to the hospital on my own power, at least.  Maybe we should make sure I didn't hurt anything actually badly."
@time=2014-05-12T03:06:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And it does appear to be true - Tsubaki's footing is shaky, but most of Rin's punches went for the upper body, so her legs are at least capable of mostly normal walking.
@time=2014-05-12T03:06:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Let's go," Michi says.
@time=2014-05-12T03:07:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm done with this scene. Anyone else got anything?
@time=2014-05-12T03:07:24.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm good.
@time=2014-05-12T03:07:31.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Thank goodness. Then, yes, I think we had best head off."
@time=2014-05-12T03:07:34.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm fine.
@time=2014-05-12T03:07:39.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :all good here
@time=2014-05-12T03:08:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, then let's call it curtains for tonight. Thanks again for playing.
@time=2014-05-12T03:08:16.000Z :ponicalica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :thanks for having us
@time=2014-05-12T03:08:33.000Z :Alicia PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Indeed.
