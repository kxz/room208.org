[11-May-2014 22:05:21]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Canēs Magae | UPCOMING: UA (Nitya), Cybersix (Barcode)
[11-May-2014 22:05:36]  <IllFlower> All right, roll call!
[11-May-2014 22:05:47]  <Alicia> Here.
[11-May-2014 22:06:03]  <ponicalica> ready
[11-May-2014 22:06:11]  <BGTB2005> here
[11-May-2014 22:06:35]  <IllFlower> Okay, we left off last time having just talked to Nyoma.
[11-May-2014 22:06:51]  <IllFlower> I recall you guys wanted to go see Michi.
[11-May-2014 22:07:12]  <ponicalica> I believe so.
[11-May-2014 22:07:20]  <Alicia> Yes.
[11-May-2014 22:07:30]  <BGTB2005> yep
[11-May-2014 22:08:24]  <IllFlower> Then why don't we do that?
[11-May-2014 22:10:57]  <IllFlower> Nyoma suggested looking for her in her university dorm, so the Conservators get together in a nearby park in the afternoon and put heads together on what to do from there.
[11-May-2014 22:11:37]  <IllFlower> There's always the option of just all showing up on her doorstep, but that didn't work out so well the last time the girls tried that, so maybe another strategy might be warranted...
[11-May-2014 22:12:55]  <ponicalica> Well, I think Rin might be okay with that, but she has other goals...
[11-May-2014 22:14:15]  <Alicia> "Ayako, Rin, what ideas do you have for contacting Michi? I was thinking, we could always tail her until an opportune situation presents itself."
[11-May-2014 22:14:23]  <IllFlower> Rin's always about knocking down doors, apparently.
[11-May-2014 22:14:26]  <ponicalica> Not much is coming to mind.  In the "terrible ideas" department there's "wait until she leaves the dorm and then start talking" but...
[11-May-2014 22:16:06]  <BGTB2005> "Tracking her sounds good."
[11-May-2014 22:16:24]  <ponicalica> "Hmm.  Maybe that would work.  Presumably she'll have some events or leave to get food or something..."
[11-May-2014 22:16:27]  <IllFlower> So what's the plan here?
[11-May-2014 22:17:40]  *** KogasakaYou is now known as AttObl
[11-May-2014 22:17:51]  <ponicalica> probably just wait for her to leave the building and follow her or something.  Alicia, BGTB2005?
[11-May-2014 22:17:57]  <Alicia> Hikari nods. "Of course, we can't underestimate her at all, but... that's all I've got. And it's better than knocking on doors, I think."
[11-May-2014 22:18:02]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Yerp.
[11-May-2014 22:18:27]  <BGTB2005> "Only other alternative I can think of involves kicking her door in."
[11-May-2014 22:18:29]  <IllFlower> I dunno what you'd accomplish by following her around, other than maybe creeping her out.
[11-May-2014 22:18:51]  <BGTB2005> gathering intel
[11-May-2014 22:19:04]  <IllFlower> What are you after, though?
[11-May-2014 22:19:38]  <ponicalica> Probably what form the "tormenting" takes.
[11-May-2014 22:19:42]  <BGTB2005> Maybe she'll meet her circle of friends?
[11-May-2014 22:19:45]  <Alicia> The goal is to find out what she's done to Yumiko. It seems ideal if we can get her when she's alone.
[11-May-2014 22:20:56]  <IllFlower> The girls hang around the park for a little while, keeping an eye on the door to Michi's room.
[11-May-2014 22:21:55]  <IllFlower> After waiting for about an hour and a half, during which a couple of coffee and bathroom runs are made, someone finally emerges into the hallway.
[11-May-2014 22:23:01]  <IllFlower> That's Michi, no doubt, though her hair's quite a bit longer these days than it is in the picture the Conservators were given.
[11-May-2014 22:24:10]  <IllFlower> She walks down the stairs and out onto the street facing the park. There's a bag slung over her shoulder, one that looks like something any college student might have.
[11-May-2014 22:25:03]  <IllFlower> It's clear she hasn't bothered to lock the door to her room. It's a fairly safe neighborhood, to be fair, but...
[11-May-2014 22:25:22]  <Alicia> (Reminds me. In my mind, Hikari carried around a pack or something, too.)
[11-May-2014 22:25:46]  <ponicalica> Well, of course she does.  Gotta keep the brass knuckles, the handcuffs, and the water bottles somewhere...
[11-May-2014 22:25:56]  <IllFlower> Hahahaha.
[11-May-2014 22:26:05]  <Alicia> (Heheheh, well, yeah.)
[11-May-2014 22:26:08]  <BGTB2005> (hikari go loot the place)
[11-May-2014 22:26:21]  <IllFlower> Well, the opportunity to look around while she's gone has presented itself. What say you?
[11-May-2014 22:27:08]  <Alicia> Well, what is there to gain from it? It certainly sounds interesting, but I'm not sold on the idea.
[11-May-2014 22:27:37]  <ponicalica> She might have records of something relating to her magical dealings.
[11-May-2014 22:27:48]  <IllFlower> Your potential information sources aren't constantly moving, for one. ;)
[11-May-2014 22:29:20]  <Alicia> Hm, good points.
[11-May-2014 22:29:31]  <ponicalica> Also, Rin's less likely to punch Michi's belongings.
[11-May-2014 22:29:56]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[11-May-2014 22:30:31]  <Alicia> Okay, yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Just as long as Rin doesn't take her aggression out on her belongings. :p
[11-May-2014 22:31:02]  <Alicia> (Though, let's hope we don't repeat what happened last time we investigated...)
[11-May-2014 22:31:26]  <IllFlower> So you guys are going to head in?
[11-May-2014 22:31:32]  <ponicalica> Yeah.  Let's head in.
[11-May-2014 22:31:33]  <BGTB2005> (who knows, we might meet her friends)
[11-May-2014 22:32:20]  <IllFlower> Once Michi is out of sight, the girls steal across the screet and into Michi's dorm building.
[11-May-2014 22:32:53]  <IllFlower> Strategy here? One of you want to be a lookout or something?
[11-May-2014 22:33:10]  <Alicia> Rin, perhaps?
[11-May-2014 22:33:11]  <IllFlower> Actually, this is a role-playing game. You guys work it out. :p
[11-May-2014 22:33:22]  <ponicalica> On the other hand, Rin as a lookout would be a bad idea
[11-May-2014 22:33:41]  <IllFlower> Because she'd punch Michi if she came back?
[11-May-2014 22:33:45]  <ponicalica> exactly
[11-May-2014 22:33:58]  <Alicia> Not if she kept her jets cooled.
[11-May-2014 22:33:58]  <IllFlower> Who's the least likely to punch someone, then? Ayako?
[11-May-2014 22:34:05]  <ponicalica> Probably, lol
[11-May-2014 22:34:33]  <IllFlower> But don't you remember what happened last time Ayako was on the outside? D:
[11-May-2014 22:34:37]  <ponicalica> This is true.
[11-May-2014 22:34:45]  <Alicia> Oh God.
[11-May-2014 22:34:48]  <BGTB2005> (not seeing the downside to Rin punching Michi)
[11-May-2014 22:34:48]  <ponicalica> Maybe it should be Hikari.
[11-May-2014 22:34:58]  <Alicia> Hikari could talk them to death.
[11-May-2014 22:35:34]  <ponicalica> Or at least talk her to let Rin and Ayako make an exit.
[11-May-2014 22:35:40]  <IllFlower> Well, either way, you guys should describe exactly what's happening. Details are important.
[11-May-2014 22:35:54]  <BGTB2005> Would probably involve less investigating than Rin punching people to death
[11-May-2014 22:35:57]  <IllFlower> Let's say they're at the foot of the building stairwell. So...
[11-May-2014 22:36:46]  <ponicalica> Ayako walks up the stairs and towards the room.  "Rin, you follow me.  Hikari, you look out for Michi.  Do something magical as she gets close."
[11-May-2014 22:36:57]  <Alicia> (>Hikari >magical)
[11-May-2014 22:37:12]  <IllFlower> "'Do something magical,' she said. 'It'll be okay,' she said."
[11-May-2014 22:37:20]  <ponicalica> "She or the campus police, I guess, really."
[11-May-2014 22:38:02]  <Alicia> "I'll see what I can do, Ayako. You two be careful, please."
[11-May-2014 22:38:14]  <ponicalica> (you can never be too careful with the Territorial Authority)
[11-May-2014 22:38:20]  <IllFlower> Ayako and Rin head up the stairs, then. Michi's room is on the third floor.
[11-May-2014 22:38:49]  <IllFlower> It's one of those buildings with a central staircase and two apartments opening onto every landing.
[11-May-2014 22:39:28]  <IllFlower> Soon enough, the two girls are in front of the door to room 301. And the door to room 302, but that's not important.
[11-May-2014 22:40:00]  <Alicia> (Do fire alarms count as magical.)
[11-May-2014 22:40:30]  <ponicalica> (Technically no but that'll work too, as long as they don't trigger sprinklers.  If they do, you'll piss off Rin more than she already is.)
[11-May-2014 22:40:31]  <IllFlower> Do you knock? Kick the door from its hinges and storm in? Just open the door and walk in?
[11-May-2014 22:41:04]  <ponicalica> It's unlocked, but I guess there might indeed be more than one person in there.
[11-May-2014 22:41:07]  <ponicalica> hmm
[11-May-2014 22:41:08]  <Alicia> (Good, good.)
[11-May-2014 22:41:09]  <BGTB2005> (Rin votes to kick the door in)
[11-May-2014 22:41:37]  <Alicia> Kicking might cause unnecessary alarm, though.
[11-May-2014 22:41:47]  <ponicalica> Also it'd be way obvious what happened when Michi comes back
[11-May-2014 22:42:27]  <Alicia> And that.
[11-May-2014 22:42:44]  <ponicalica> We could just open the door, and hope Michi doesn't have a roommate in there watching porn or something.  ("Too bad Hikari's not here, she'd enjoy this.")
[11-May-2014 22:42:46]  <IllFlower> What's the call?
[11-May-2014 22:43:22]  <ponicalica> Ayako gives two knocks on the door, and then, assuming nobody responds, simply opens it and walks in.  If someone is there, welp...
[11-May-2014 22:43:58]  <IllFlower> "Just a second!" someone calls from inside the room.
[11-May-2014 22:44:01]  <Alicia> (Oh my gosh, pony.)
[11-May-2014 22:44:33]  <BGTB2005> (Rin elects to punch 'em in the face)
[11-May-2014 22:44:48]  <BGTB2005> (later, though)
[11-May-2014 22:44:50]  <BGTB2005> (probably)
[11-May-2014 22:45:00]  <Alicia> (As long as you do it nicely.)
[11-May-2014 22:45:37]  <IllFlower> Before Ayako or Rin can think of what to do next, the door opens, revealing a short-haired girl about Michi's age. She's dressed incredibly casually, with just a long-sleeved shirt over a pair of shorts.
[11-May-2014 22:45:54]  <IllFlower> "That was fast, Mi--" the girl says, before stopping short.
[11-May-2014 22:46:13]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@108-204-104-234.lightspeed.cicril.sbcglobal.net> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.90.1 [Firefox 29.0.1/20140506152807])
[11-May-2014 22:46:27]  <IllFlower> "Uh..." she finally stutters. "Can I help you?"
[11-May-2014 22:47:33]  <ponicalica> "This is Michi Akase's room, right?"
[11-May-2014 22:47:50]  <ponicalica> Also, does anything pop out about the room from what we can see from the opened door?
[11-May-2014 22:48:10]  <IllFlower> Rin, peeking out from behind Ayako, realizes that she recognizes the girl's face.
[11-May-2014 22:48:44]  <ponicalica> ("It was...................KAEDE!")
[11-May-2014 22:48:53]  <IllFlower> She can't recall her name or who exactly she is, but something rises in her chest...
[11-May-2014 22:49:46]  <IllFlower> "Um, uh, yeah," the girl continues. "She just went out to buy dinner. Are you looking for her?"
[11-May-2014 22:51:11]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: The girl's blocking the doorway, so it's hard to see anything in particular behind her.
[11-May-2014 22:51:56]  <Alicia> Hikari, meanwhile, idly watches people pass by.
[11-May-2014 22:52:26]  <ponicalica> "Yeah, we're in a math class with her, and we slept in today, so she said she was willing to let us look at her notes.  Do you think you could let us in so we could grab them for a sec?"
[11-May-2014 22:53:26]  <IllFlower> Isn't Ayako, like, 16?
[11-May-2014 22:53:34]  <BGTB2005> (does the other girl recognise Rin?)
[11-May-2014 22:53:37]  <ponicalica> There are sixteen year olds in college classes!
[11-May-2014 22:53:41]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Nope.
[11-May-2014 22:53:47]  <BGTB2005> (and I don't think the other girl knows that)
[11-May-2014 22:53:49]  <ponicalica> BGTB2005: probably not; for her, it was tuesday
[11-May-2014 22:54:24]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but Michi's pretty obviously in her early twenties.
[11-May-2014 22:54:30]  <IllFlower> Well, whatever.
[11-May-2014 22:54:43]  <Alicia> Oh sheesh,
[11-May-2014 22:54:45]  <Alicia> .*
[11-May-2014 22:54:55]  <ponicalica> Ayako's a bright girl.  I think it's possible. :P
[11-May-2014 22:55:29]  <IllFlower> The girl gives Ayako an odd look. "Math?"
[11-May-2014 22:55:49]  <IllFlower> She rubs her forehead. "Math, huh?" she says to herself. "Kinda suspicious..."
[11-May-2014 22:56:31]  <IllFlower> After a moment, she looks up, and suddenly asks, "What's with her?"
[11-May-2014 22:56:35]  <BGTB2005> (She can't recall her name or who exactly she is, but something rises in her chest... <-- if I'm interpreting this correctly, would some sort of hand-to-hand conflict be a reasonable reaction? Or am I drawing the wrong conclusion?)
[11-May-2014 22:57:13]  <ponicalica> It wouldn't be unreasonable for Rin to suddenly try to tackle this girl to the ground, from what I understand about Rin, but...
[11-May-2014 22:57:16]  <IllFlower> By which she means Rin, who's looking pretty agitated.
[11-May-2014 22:57:26]  <BGTB2005> (bah, dinner)
[11-May-2014 22:57:31]  <ponicalica> "I don't know.  Rin, are you okay?"
[11-May-2014 22:57:34]  <BGTB2005> (I will try to eat as fast as possible)
[11-May-2014 22:58:03]  <BGTB2005> "I'm...fine"

[11-May-2014 23:00:07]  <ponicalica> same
[11-May-2014 23:00:23]  <Alicia> Wellll.
[11-May-2014 23:01:01]  <Alicia> (So we get to see what a girl happened to do to Rin, eh? I'm ready.)
[11-May-2014 23:02:19]  <ponicalica> we probably get to see Rin have the opposite response to her tormentor than Sumire to hers
[11-May-2014 23:02:28]  <ponicalica> (Sumire, in case you don't remember, basically curled up into a ball)

[11-May-2014 23:09:57]  <ponicalica> you know, I don't think anyone's quite used guns in this campaign yet.  Cannons, yes, guns, no
[11-May-2014 23:11:41]  <BGTB2005> back
[11-May-2014 23:12:05]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that's because Mami and Homura cornered the market on magical guns.
[11-May-2014 23:12:24]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: So we're thinking about whether Rin would punch the girl.
[11-May-2014 23:12:28]  <BGTB2005> yes
[11-May-2014 23:12:47]  <IllFlower> She would?
[11-May-2014 23:12:51]  <BGTB2005> Especially if Rin's recognising her as one of her own bullies
[11-May-2014 23:13:15]  <IllFlower> Well, she's angry about *something*.
[11-May-2014 23:13:56]  <ponicalica> so will Rin now be pushing Ayako away to punch the girl?
[11-May-2014 23:14:20]  <Alicia> And Ayako trying to fight back?
[11-May-2014 23:14:40]  <IllFlower> I don't have any objection, so all that's left is for BGTB2005 to actually have Rin take a swing.
[11-May-2014 23:14:41]  <Alicia> (Also, this is entirely unrelated, but do you have a physical description of Michi aside from early 20s, IF?)
[11-May-2014 23:14:49]  <IllFlower> Unless Ayako's going to try and keep her back.
[11-May-2014 23:14:58]  <Alicia> hold her back*
[11-May-2014 23:15:19]  <BGTB2005> "Ayako, move."
[11-May-2014 23:15:56]  <ponicalica> "Hmm?" Ayako reflexively moves, but "What are you about t-"
[11-May-2014 23:16:19]  <IllFlower> Alicia: She's got pretty long hair and is decently tall. Has a sense of style, too, but she is a college student in the city; you'd kind of expect that.
[11-May-2014 23:17:13]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Cool, thanks.

[11-May-2014 23:18:43]  <BGTB2005> Rin winds up a punch, targeting the girl in the doorway
[11-May-2014 23:19:34]  <IllFlower> Rin's fist catches the girl completely off guard.
[11-May-2014 23:20:09]  <IllFlower> She's knocked back into the room, flat on her back.
[11-May-2014 23:20:37]  <Alicia> (Ouch.)
[11-May-2014 23:20:41]  <IllFlower> The now-unmoored door gradually swings out into the hallway.
[11-May-2014 23:20:49]  <ponicalica> "Rin, what the hell are you doing?  This girl probably isn't even an initiate!"
[11-May-2014 23:21:46]  <Alicia> Hikari looks up, thinking she heard something, before returning to guard duty.
[11-May-2014 23:22:22]  <IllFlower> The girl struggles to sit upright, her hand clutching her stomach.
[11-May-2014 23:22:48]  <IllFlower> A low, pained groan runs from her mouth.
[11-May-2014 23:24:11]  <IllFlower> You guys really do have a habit of getting into fights with people whose names you don't even know, huh?
[11-May-2014 23:24:56]  <ponicalica> Well, Rin knows, probably.
[11-May-2014 23:25:06]  <Alicia> (What's her name, RinTB?)
[11-May-2014 23:25:44]  <IllFlower> Rin tuberculosis? Yikes.
[11-May-2014 23:25:49]  <BGTB2005> (Rin doesn't quite remember)
[11-May-2014 23:26:17]  <IllFlower> Rin, staring at the girl sprawled on the floor before her, begins to recall the flickers of a name.
[11-May-2014 23:26:51]  <IllFlower> Tsubaki? a voice suggests, in between Rin's agitated breaths. Yes, that was it.

[11-May-2014 23:32:14]  <ponicalica> say something about how she's a bully or something
[11-May-2014 23:32:16]  <IllFlower> You just punched a girl. I don't think you need to know.
[11-May-2014 23:32:24]  <IllFlower> You just need to feel. From your gut.
[11-May-2014 23:32:57]  <ponicalica> Rin Colbert
[11-May-2014 23:33:11]  <IllFlower> Which you can do, unlike the girl you just punched. In the gut.
[11-May-2014 23:33:29]  <Alicia> Rin just punched a girl in the gut.
[11-May-2014 23:33:44]  <Alicia> BGTB2005: Just let it ouuuuut, whatever ya got.
[11-May-2014 23:34:00]  <IllFlower> Pretty sure this isn't the kind of thing that's going to escape Hikari's attention.
[11-May-2014 23:34:05]  <Alicia> (Also, really, aaalmost any idea is fine and can be ran with.)
[11-May-2014 23:34:15]  <Alicia> IllFlower: What do you mean?
[11-May-2014 23:34:20]  <Alicia> Oh duh.
[11-May-2014 23:34:23]  <BGTB2005> "Retribution." (answering poni)
[11-May-2014 23:34:25]  <ponicalica> Alicia: He means that Alicia should notice something's happening up there.
[11-May-2014 23:34:45]  <Alicia> ponicalica: Oh, yeah, but isn't she also guard dutying? But then again...
[11-May-2014 23:34:46]  <ponicalica> "Retribution for what?  We have a duty here, and it's not punching random girls with no explanation!"
[11-May-2014 23:36:58]  <IllFlower> Alicia: The time for just looking out for trouble has passed, given that trouble is happening.
[11-May-2014 23:37:02]  <Alicia> Hikari takes a quick glance around, before rushing upstairs. "Ayako, Rin, what ha- ...Rin!?"
[11-May-2014 23:38:50]  <IllFlower> The girl glances at the door, as if wanting to close and lock it, but Rin's standing entirely in the way.
[11-May-2014 23:39:01]  <BGTB2005> "You two check inside, I'll deal with Tsubaki."
[11-May-2014 23:39:22]  <IllFlower> Cold.
[11-May-2014 23:40:26]  <Alicia> She glances at the girl, then Rin. "Does it really have to be settled like, this..." her voice trails off, as she gently steps inside.
[11-May-2014 23:40:37]  <Alicia> "Rin, don't maul her, please."
[11-May-2014 23:41:06]  <ponicalica> "Hikari, you deal with the room.  I'll stay here and make sure that Rin doesn't break her entire purpose as a Conservator."
[11-May-2014 23:41:41]  <ponicalica> add "over some ill-defined «retribution»" to that line
[11-May-2014 23:42:05]  <IllFlower> The girl Rin called Tsubaki is still conscious, mind you. In pain, but conscious.
[11-May-2014 23:42:32]  <Alicia> "Thank you." she replies, before scavenging through Michi's belongings, starting with her bags.
[11-May-2014 23:43:04]  *** SF_Sorrow <SF_Sorrow@eduroam-254-130.ucsc.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[11-May-2014 23:43:32]  <ponicalica> Yeah but I want to communicate these things somehow so I'll just assume magic that she's not hearing/paying attention.
[11-May-2014 23:43:44]  <IllFlower> Hikari steps through the entrance hall, past the door to the bathroom into the main room.
[11-May-2014 23:43:55]  <IllFlower> The television's on, tuned to some afternoon variety show.
[11-May-2014 23:44:05]  <BGTB2005> being called away, brb
[11-May-2014 23:44:25]  <IllFlower> The room's a little untidy; there's a pile of clothes next to the bed, and a couple of dishes are stacked in the sink. It's nothing too bad, though.
[11-May-2014 23:46:14]  <IllFlower> Hikari takes a peek at the desk. A piece of note paper catches her eye. Along with some other scribbles, it has, in large characters, the words "Minako Endou - new member," circled for emphasis.
[11-May-2014 23:47:12]  <BGTB2005> (back)
[11-May-2014 23:48:20]  <IllFlower> ponicalica: I was thinking more that Ayako's so incredulous that she just forgets to be secretive.
[11-May-2014 23:48:23]  <Alicia> Hikari takes out a notebook, scratching down the name, while scouring the desk.
[11-May-2014 23:48:46]  <ponicalica> IllFlower: heh, that probably works too
[11-May-2014 23:49:19]  <BGTB2005> I figured Tsubaki's hurting enough to not really be paying attention
[11-May-2014 23:49:25]  <ponicalica> Hikari has a notebook too now?  ("No, she's just using Ayako's.")
[11-May-2014 23:49:30]  <IllFlower> Alicia: Underneath are written a time and location: Saturday, 3:00 PM, Takami schoolyard.
[11-May-2014 23:49:39]  <IllFlower> Oh, and the words "fitness test."
[11-May-2014 23:49:41]  <BGTB2005> Or she grabbed it from the room
[11-May-2014 23:49:52]  <Alicia> It's one of her personal ones.
[11-May-2014 23:50:00]  <Alicia> This is a field notebook.
[11-May-2014 23:50:12]  <Alicia> Fitness test, eh.
[11-May-2014 23:50:16]  <IllFlower> She's got a bag with lots of stuff in it.
[11-May-2014 23:50:26]  <Alicia> Puh-retty much.
[11-May-2014 23:50:46]  <IllFlower> brb "Clint Eastwood"
[11-May-2014 23:51:07]  <ponicalica> are you calling Hikari useless
[11-May-2014 23:51:25]  <Alicia> :(
[11-May-2014 23:51:34]  <IllFlower> She's got sunshine in a bag.
[11-May-2014 23:51:55]  <Alicia> Good enough for me.

[11-May-2014 23:53:32]  <ponicalica> "Rin, what are you doing?  We have a job here, and it's to figure out the link between Michi and Yumiko's flares, not to punch this innocent Tsubaki girl!"
[11-May-2014 23:53:40]  <Alicia> ("Corruption in disguise, from this fuckin' enterprise")
[11-May-2014 23:53:59]  <ponicalica> (sort of repeating herself, but Rin's response has so far been one word... :V)

[11-May-2014 23:57:10]  <ponicalica> Ayako stands herself between Rin and Tsubaki.
[11-May-2014 23:58:35]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005?
[11-May-2014 23:58:40]  <BGTB2005> thinkinh
[11-May-2014 23:59:10]  <Alicia> (Anything works, within reason.)
[11-May-2014 23:59:12]  <IllFlower> The perfect is the enemy of the good.
[11-May-2014 23:59:43]  <IllFlower> I don't think you're allowed to put more thought into what Rin does than Rin would right now, in any case. And she's clearly not thinking.
[12-May-2014 00:00:12]  <Alicia> (Yeah, "acceptable" is just fine.)
[12-May-2014 00:01:07]  <BGTB2005> "Ayako, move."
[12-May-2014 00:01:36]  <ponicalica> "Not without, at the very least, much more explanation.  Why are you attacking this girl?"
[12-May-2014 00:03:52]  <ponicalica> (It might be good to start a conflict here, with the stakes being Ayako moving?)
[12-May-2014 00:04:22]  <IllFlower> Let's see what BGTB2005 has to say...
[12-May-2014 00:04:26]  <BGTB2005> "Tsubaki had made my life hell. I believe she and her other friends are doing to same to Yumiko."
[12-May-2014 00:05:09]  <BGTB2005> (is this acceptable?)
[12-May-2014 00:05:32]  <ponicalica> (yeah, that's good)
[12-May-2014 00:05:33]  <Alicia> (Presumably it's just Ayako v. Rin, yes? Since Hikari is busy gathering information.)
[12-May-2014 00:05:40]  <ponicalica> (And yeah, Hikari's investigating)
[12-May-2014 00:05:56]  <Alicia> (Okay, cool. I thought so but didn't want to assume. ANYWAY.)
[12-May-2014 00:08:05]  <IllFlower> Looks like we have a conflict.
[12-May-2014 00:08:34]  <ponicalica> Ayako doesn't budge.
[12-May-2014 00:08:44]  <IllFlower> Let's roll. What's the venue?
[12-May-2014 00:08:47]  <ponicalica> And conflict would start as talking, yes?
[12-May-2014 00:08:58]  <ponicalica> unless Rin wants to punch
[12-May-2014 00:09:06]  <IllFlower> Wherever you think is suitable.
[12-May-2014 00:09:44]  <ponicalica> Ayako has things to say, at least.
[12-May-2014 00:10:06]  <BGTB2005> (Rin wants to punch <-- always)
[12-May-2014 00:10:14]  <ponicalica> but does she want to punch Ayako?
[12-May-2014 00:10:25]  <BGTB2005> probably not
[12-May-2014 00:10:31]  <Alicia> (I'm just going to assume Rin's initial punch was *really* hard, thus giving them the time to fight.)
[12-May-2014 00:10:55]  <IllFlower> Tsubaki isn't in much of a state to do anything.
[12-May-2014 00:11:15]  <IllFlower> And besides, you can have conflicts that last for no more than seconds of in-game time.
[12-May-2014 00:11:46]  <IllFlower> Okay, the stakes are whether Ayako manages to keep Rin from jumping on Tsubaki.
[12-May-2014 00:11:50]  <ponicalica> also what sort of anime is it if you can't have characters talking for as long as they need to
[12-May-2014 00:12:00]  <IllFlower> I assume you'll be starting at talking, so that's Ac+Ht.
[12-May-2014 00:12:08]  <Alicia> IllFlower: Point, point.

[12-May-2014 00:13:17]  <BGTB2005> @dice add 2d4

[12-May-2014 00:45:01]  <Alicia> I accidentally the phrasing...

[12-May-2014 00:45:37]  <BGTB2005> I'm thinking of doing that but I'm not sure how that would translate mechanics-wise
[12-May-2014 00:45:39]  <Alicia> Eheh.
[12-May-2014 00:45:55]  <ponicalica> Shoving Ayako out of the way would be an esclation to physical non-fighting
[12-May-2014 00:46:50]  <Alicia> Oh right, yeah it would be. Then there's always, I dunno, shouting her down/etc.?
[12-May-2014 00:47:07]  <BGTB2005> I have like no dice
[12-May-2014 00:47:29]  <ponicalica> well you could probably add direct/blunt/plainspoken, or you could escalate as a "Fuck this, I'm pushing past you"

[12-May-2014 00:54:48]  <BGTB2005> I think it would be more in-character for Rin to try and physically shove Ayako out of the way
[12-May-2014 00:55:12]  <ponicalica> Okay, we can do that, which I think would escalate to fighting and mean both Bd+Wl would be added.  IllFlower?
[12-May-2014 00:55:57]  <IllFlower> No problems here.

[12-May-2014 00:59:11]  <ponicalica> I think BGTB2005 still has to see 6?
[12-May-2014 01:00:13]  <IllFlower> Yeah, BGTB2005, you still have to see the 6 ponicalica raised.
[12-May-2014 01:00:38]  <Alicia> 41 v. 45, now we're talking.
[12-May-2014 01:01:02]  <IllFlower> That being said, Rin's in a pretty advantageous position, so if she just brushes Ayako off to see, and then raises by (say) tackling, we're all good.
[12-May-2014 01:02:28]  <BGTB2005> would lunging (see 6) and tackling (raise another 6) work as reversing the blow?
[12-May-2014 01:02:51]  <IllFlower> Or just ignoring her to see 6, yes.
[12-May-2014 01:02:51]  <BGTB2005> or not?
[12-May-2014 01:02:56]  <ponicalica> if you see with just a 6, you get to use that in the raise; that's what reversing the blow is
[12-May-2014 01:04:05]  <IllFlower> Right, I think he intends to raise 12.
[12-May-2014 01:05:24]  <BGTB2005> Unable to form a reply, Rin simply lunges and tackles Ayako

[12-May-2014 02:05:37]  <BGTB2005> trying to figure out how to put it into prose, but basically Rin attempts to escape the lock to retaliate, taking some sort of injury in the process

[12-May-2014 02:12:11]  <ponicalica> Ayako takes the punch in the face.  "Is this really how much you...want to hurt her that you'll punch a conservator" Ayako manages to say, despite having the balance knocked out of her by the punch.  Give.
[12-May-2014 02:12:35]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Roll for fallout.

[12-May-2014 02:13:10]  <IllFlower> Yes, as well as a piece of experience fallout.
[12-May-2014 02:13:40]  <Alicia> Wait, how's the piece of experience fallout work.
[12-May-2014 02:14:01]  <IllFlower> You get it if you roll a 1 as a fallout die. See the list on page 82.
[12-May-2014 02:14:42]  <IllFlower> I could see "if it doesn't work, use more" getting a die bump.
[12-May-2014 02:14:55]  <BGTB2005> for long-term I guess 1d4 relationship with Ayako?
[12-May-2014 02:14:58]  <Alicia> Ah.

[12-May-2014 02:22:38]  <IllFlower> Ayako's incapacitated. Tsubaki's still on the ground, though she's backed up a bit.
[12-May-2014 02:22:46]  <IllFlower> Hikari's... well, just kinda there, apparently.
[12-May-2014 02:22:57]  <IllFlower> What's Rin up to?
[12-May-2014 02:23:00]  <Alicia> Hikari rushes over to Rin and Ayako, pushing between them "What in the world are you two doing!? This isn't the time for that!"

[12-May-2014 02:25:46]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that.
[12-May-2014 02:29:06]  <BGTB2005> Rin's returned to assaulting Tsubaki
[12-May-2014 02:30:08]  <IllFlower> As Rin turns away from Ayako to resume her work on Tsubaki, a cold voice interrupts.

[12-May-2014 02:30:43]  <IllFlower> "Miss, please do tell me what you're doing in front of my apartment."
[12-May-2014 02:32:40]  <ponicalica> ("Um, I'm a Conservator, and I'm beating up your roommate because she bullied me in the past.")
[12-May-2014 02:32:45]  <IllFlower> Ayako looks up to see Michi standing in the stairwell, two steps below the landing.
[12-May-2014 02:35:01]  <IllFlower> Is Rin just going on, paying no heed to Michi's return?
[12-May-2014 02:36:09]  <ponicalica> Ayako looks around for Hikari, having effectively resigned to the idea that Rin is interested only in her side mission.
[12-May-2014 02:36:21]  <BGTB2005> "I was airing my grievances with your roommate."
[12-May-2014 02:36:45]  <Alicia> Hikari packs up her items, walking up to Ayako's side. "I think we need to *go*" she mouths quietly, not hiding her anger.
[12-May-2014 02:37:46]  <ponicalica> "I'm not sure Rin's reachable.  If Michi's not going to just throw us out it might be worth asking her something, but I doubt it, so yeah..."
[12-May-2014 02:37:53]  <ponicalica> Ayako whispers this to Hikari.
[12-May-2014 02:39:18]  <Alicia> She sighs, "You've got a point. So, then, I figure we stay?"
[12-May-2014 02:39:31]  <IllFlower> "You must have some unspeakable grievances," Michi says.
[12-May-2014 02:40:08]  <IllFlower> She forces her way in between Rin and the by now nearly unconscious Tsubaki.
[12-May-2014 02:41:07]  <IllFlower> "I'm going to have to ask you to leave," she says to Rin. "Now."
[12-May-2014 02:41:41]  <IllFlower> She fires a glance of concern at Ayako.
[12-May-2014 02:42:06]  <IllFlower> Michi must think Ayako's just another random victim.
[12-May-2014 02:43:28]  * KogasakaYou gets reminded of Gaim upon seeing Michi
[12-May-2014 02:43:49]  <ponicalica> KogasakaYou: yeah i've been avoiding making grape jokes since last week
[12-May-2014 02:44:06]  <KogasakaYou> Ah. Keep up the good work.
[12-May-2014 02:47:56]  <Alicia> (Boop)
[12-May-2014 02:48:05]  <ponicalica> Ayako looks back at Michi.  She considers asking about Yumiko right then and there, but it's not exactly a good time.
[12-May-2014 02:49:22]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: What say you?
[12-May-2014 02:49:57]  <BGTB2005> I don't think Rin's ready for Round 2: Rin Tries to Get Herself Arrested
[12-May-2014 02:50:50]  <BGTB2005> Glaring at Michi, Rin heads down the stairs
[12-May-2014 02:51:14]  <IllFlower> Michi lifts Tsubaki by the shoulder as Rin disappears.
[12-May-2014 02:51:40]  <IllFlower> "Are you all right?" Michi says to Ayako.
[12-May-2014 02:52:06]  <ponicalica> "I...I think I'm alright now.  Just lost my balance..."
[12-May-2014 02:53:42]  <IllFlower> "You're not hurt?"
[12-May-2014 02:54:10]  <ponicalica> "I'll recover.  I'm...resilient."
[12-May-2014 02:54:47]  <IllFlower> Michi laughs nervously. "I'm glad to hear that."
[12-May-2014 02:56:42]  <IllFlower> She turns for a moment to Tsubaki, making sure that she can stand, before addressing Ayako again.
[12-May-2014 02:57:10]  <IllFlower> "I'm Michi Akase, by the way."
[12-May-2014 02:59:47]  <ponicalica> "Ayako Minakami.  Nice to meet you, even if the circumstances aren't...ideal..."
[12-May-2014 03:00:04]  <IllFlower> "You can say that again."
[12-May-2014 03:00:39]  <ponicalica> where is Hikari in all this btw
[12-May-2014 03:01:08]  <Alicia> Looking behind Ayako to make sure she doesn't return.
[12-May-2014 03:01:08]  <IllFlower> Outside. I'm guessing Michi didn't notice her until she'd already stepped out of the apartment.
[12-May-2014 03:02:00]  <IllFlower> "I'm going to take her to the hospital," Michi says. "Her" meaning Tsubaki, of course.
[12-May-2014 03:02:33]  <IllFlower> She pulls her keys out of her bag and locks the apartment door behind her, no small feat considering she has another girl limply hanging onto her.
[12-May-2014 03:02:50]  <IllFlower> "Do you want to come with us? Just to be safe."
[12-May-2014 03:03:08]  <ponicalica> "Hmm, that might be a good idea.  Hikari, what do you think?"
[12-May-2014 03:03:39]  <IllFlower> Hikari might want to make sure Rin doesn't explode.
[12-May-2014 03:04:10]  <Alicia> Hikari walks over, after thoroughly checking around them. "I think that's fine. I'll... keep an eye out, though."
[12-May-2014 03:04:22]  <Alicia> She pointedly glances back once more.
[12-May-2014 03:04:49]  <Alicia> "Are you fine, though?"
[12-May-2014 03:05:24]  <IllFlower> "Yeah, I'm okay. The hospital's not far from here. We should be able to walk there. Even Tsubaki."
[12-May-2014 03:05:53]  <ponicalica> "I think I can make it to the hospital on my own power, at least.  Maybe we should make sure I didn't hurt anything actually badly."
[12-May-2014 03:06:07]  <IllFlower> And it does appear to be true - Tsubaki's footing is shaky, but most of Rin's punches went for the upper body, so her legs are at least capable of mostly normal walking.
[12-May-2014 03:06:28]  <IllFlower> "Let's go," Michi says.
[12-May-2014 03:07:14]  <IllFlower> I'm done with this scene. Anyone else got anything?
[12-May-2014 03:07:24]  <ponicalica> I'm good.
[12-May-2014 03:07:31]  <Alicia> "Thank goodness. Then, yes, I think we had best head off."
[12-May-2014 03:07:34]  <Alicia> I'm fine.
[12-May-2014 03:07:39]  <BGTB2005> all good here
[12-May-2014 03:08:07]  <IllFlower> Okay, then let's call it curtains for tonight. Thanks again for playing.
[12-May-2014 03:08:16]  <ponicalica> thanks for having us
[12-May-2014 03:08:33]  <Alicia> Indeed.
