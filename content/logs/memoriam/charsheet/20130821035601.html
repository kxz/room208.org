<body><i>The Conservators</i><br
/><b>キタ━━━(゜∀゜)━━━!!!!!&nbsp;</b><br
/><br
/><br
/><b>YANO Hitomi / 矢野 瞳 (BARCODE)</b><br
/><br
/>Background: Complicated History<br
/><br
/><u>Stats</u><br
/><ul><li>ACUITY: 4d6<ul><li>Life on the streets necessitated quick thinking and a constant eye out for an escape. This mental agility helps to improvise in magical situations as well.</li></ul
></li
><li>BODY: 4d6<ul><li>A fast body follows a fast mind. This character is fairly quick and is also used to less than ideal physical conditions. Might have a bit of a healing factor working in her favor, too.</li></ul
></li
><li>HEART: 2d6<ul><li>In order to live with the consequences of your own actions, you either accept what you've done as emotional baggage, or do whatever you can to bury your thoughts on the matter. Guess who doesn't have much to say when feelings come out.</li></ul
></li
><li>WILL: 5d6<ul><li>Self-taught intimidator and vicious in a fight, this character has earned fixer status by consistently beating the hate and fear out of her objectives, physically or mentally. She has the faculties necessary to deal with the redirected animosity, too.<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
>A devious, physical character who prefers to get things done by any means possible, even if it means walking over some feelings. Very emotionally guarded.<br
/><br
/>The oldest of the three Conservators in the group, at 20.<br
/><br
/><u>Kept dice</u>: None<br
/><br
/><u>Traits</u><br
/><ul><li>Narcotics aficionado 2d4<ul><li>Smokes. Drinks. Gets a bit restless when she can't have one or the other.</li></ul
></li
><li>Brawler 2d6<ul><li>Well-experienced in causing impacts between the harder parts of her limbs and the softer parts of her opponents.</li></ul
></li
><li>Conservator 2d10<ul><li>Well-travelled. The power she's been entrusted with is a source of strength for her; she almost seems to relish it. Perhaps a reason for some of her behaviours.</li></ul
></li
><li>Well-guarded 2d4<ul><li>Very good at not talking about herself. Doesn't like it when conversations get personal.</li></ul
></li
><li>Grudging respect d6 (initation)<ul><li>She doesn't like doing it, but she'll heed the advice of those with more experience.<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
><u>Relationships</u><br
/><ul><li>Former friends 1d8<ul><li>Grew up in what became a witch area. Sort of run down to begin with. Suffered socially growing up, and eventually things got dire between her and her friends. At this point, she was extended a contract by a Familiar after the Familiar noticed that she suffered substantially weaker symptoms than those at her high school; a possible indication of magic potential. In return for solving...some central element to the witch's power, the Familiar fast-tracked the emotional revitalization of her community. She, however, had grown bitter and confrontational along the years, made worse by this first assignment; as those around her healed, she became distant, unable to separate her magical-girl problem-solving tendencies from her day to day behaviour.&nbsp; She's spurred more enthusiastically into action when she sees people suffering from similar problems in her travels. Perhaps is spurred to be more considerate, as well.</li></ul

><u>Belongings</u><br
/><ul><li>Costume - 2d6<ul><li><a href="http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/2109/122777-63559_biomega_03_122_598lo.jpg">http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/2109/122777-63559_biomega_03_122_598lo.jpg</a> with some modifications, in particular - no apron.</li
><li><a href="http://unyieldingsteel.tumblr.com/post/58582425431/holy-shit-holy-shit-holy-shit-i-figured-out">http://unyieldingsteel.tumblr.com/post/58582425431/holy-shit-holy-shit-holy-shit-i-figured-out</a> with weapon `u`</li
><li>(olddesc) Hitomi's costume can be best described as Gigeresque. Above the waist it looks much like a ballgown. Below the waist, it resolves in a short skirt - almost more like a fauld - complimented by what can be best described as leggings and boots. The entire outfit - both the softer parts and the slightly bulkier knee-high "boots" - appear to be weaved deep red "tendrils", with her joints, forearms and shins protected by large, harder thorns.</li></ul
></li
><li>Weapon - 2d6 + d4 - Meteor Flail<ul><li>A meteor hammer that can, terrifyingly quickly, retract into a one-handed flail. This weapon is imposing on its own and becomes moreso in her altogether too-experienced hands.</li></ul
></li
><li>Fancy lighter 1d6?<ul><li>Treasured, chunky, old, aluminum lighter. Flips open and closed w ith all manner of alluring metallic sounds. Burns with a large flame. Has seen better days, but remains clockwork. She's replaced the flint a few times manually.</li></ul
></li
><li>Extensible baton 1d6<ul><li>Her favourite less-than-lethal motivator. Clips onto belt loops, looks pretty innocuous to the untrained eye. [I was going to have this as my magical weapon's non-aethereal manifestation, but...]</li></ul
></li
><li>Miniature spray can 1d6<ul><li>Something home-made she bought off someone a while back. A diminuative spraycan that rivals her lighter in size. Refills from below; she keeps it wrapped up to prevent it from messing up the inside of her purse. Useful for discretely placing more permanent runes where needed.</li

/><ul><li>ACUITY: 2d6</li

></li
><li>WILL: 4d6</li></ul
>A girl who developed a habit of throwing herself in harm's way, out of compassion for those growing up in the same unfortunate circumstances that she did. She has the physical strength and tenacity to make her self-sacrifice worth something... most of the time. Her reasoning and magical abilities suffer, though, from the stress of doing this constantly. Neither does she easily forgive those whom she feels have wronged her or her allies.<br
/><br
/>18 years old. Last year of high school.<br
/><br

/></li></ul
></li></ul
><u>Relationships</u><br
/><ul><li>Dead Boyfriend - 2d4<ul><li>KINOSHITA Takeshi / 木下 武</li
><li>They made their wishes together and became magical kids together. In a small group they managed to hold off witches for a while, but he became corrupted in the process and eventually witchified. She was forced to destroy him. She refuses to let more people die this way.</li></ul
></li
><li>Mother - 1d10<ul><li>TAKANASHI Shizuka / 高梨 静香</li
><li>Her mother doesn't know what she does with her time, but she was there throughout the ordeals she's faced and acts as a point of courage and support.</li></ul
></li
><li>Non-magical civilians - 1d8<ul><li>She won't stand for innocents getting hurt while she does her job.</li></ul
></li
><li>Hitomi - 1d6<ul><li>They've each reached some sort of understanding about how the other operates. While they may not always agree or even seem friendly they do at least work as a team.</li></ul
></li
><li>Ayako - 1d4<ul><li>The new girl and a bookworm at that. Jun is uncertain of how to treat this young magical girl. Should she be a mentor to her, or just stand by and hope the girl doesn't get hurt too much? Top that off with the mandatory distance she must show to remain one of the moderately cool athletic girls at school.</li></ul
></li
><li>Available - 1d4 1d6 1d8 1d10<br/><br
/></li></ul
><u>Belongings</u><br
/><ul><li>Costume - 1d6<ul><li>A mish-mash of samurai armor and informal garmets. A sleeveless gray tunic and dark purple hakama form the base layer while outer layers are built out of armor that doesn't always appear to be entirely connected to her outfit. The spaulders hang around her bare arms and her forearms and hands are bound with leather strips. An armored skirt protects her legs. All of the armor looks faintly damaged and dented, like it's seen too many battles without repair.</li></ul
></li
><li>Shinai - 1d6</li
><li>Cracked Ring - 1d4<ul><li>The remnants of her boyfriend's magical focus. She wears it on a chain around her neck.</li></ul
></li
><li>The Book of Five Rings - 1d6<ul><li>Full of notes in the margins with little words of encouragement to herself mixed with notes about tactics.</li></ul
></li
><li>Lipstick - 1d6<ul><li>Uses it to draw magical seals and to make herself feel pretty when she's feeling down.<br/><br
/></li></ul

>A by-the-book girl who strongly values order and reason. She has a good head on her shoulders, and can be stubborn when it comes to discussing the details of her job in the abstract, but is relatively inexperienced when it comes to handling truly messy, violent, or emotionally fraught situations.<br

/><br

/><br
/><u>Traits</u><br
/><ul><li>well-read 2d10<ul><li>in particular, on magical matters; given the lack of adults in the magical world, who would keep such books, though? (this is more a world-fleshing-out thing, I guess)</li></ul

></li
><li>MUKAI Yurika / 向井 百合香 1d8<ul><li>close friend of the mentor who initially doubted Ayako, came to think "maybe she has potential after all"; proving the latter assertion right and the earlier sentiment wrong stays close to her mind</li></ul
