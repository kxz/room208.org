/><br
/><br
/><b>YANO Hitomi / 矢野 瞳 (BARCODE)</b><br
/><br
/>Background: Complicated History<br
/><br
/><u>Stats</u><br
/><ul><li>ACUITY: 4d6<ul><li>Life on the streets necessitated quick thinking and a constant eye out for an escape. This mental agility helps to improvise in magical situations as well.</li></ul
></li
><li>BODY: 4d6<ul><li>A fast body follows a fast mind. This character is fairly quick and is also used to less than ideal physical conditions. Might have a bit of a healing factor working in her favor, too.</li></ul
></li
><li>HEART: 2d6<ul><li>In order to live with the consequences of your own actions, you either accept what you've done as emotional baggage, or do whatever you can to bury your thoughts on the matter. Guess who doesn't have much to say when feelings come out.</li></ul
></li
><li>WILL: 5d6<ul><li>Self-taught intimidator and vicious in a fight, this character has earned fixer status by consistently beating the hate and fear out of her objectives, physically or mentally. She has the faculties necessary to deal with the redirected animosity, too.<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
>A devious, physical character who prefers to get things done by any means possible, even if it means walking over some feelings. Very emotionally guarded.<br
/><br
/>The oldest of the three Conservators in the group, at 20.<br
/><br
/><u>Kept dice</u>: None<br
/><br
/><u>Traits</u><br
/><ul><li>Narcotics aficionado 2d4<ul><li>Smokes. Drinks. Gets a bit restless when she can't have one or the other.</li></ul
></li
><li>Brawler 2d6<ul><li>Well-experienced in causing impacts between the harder parts of her limbs and the softer parts of her opponents.</li></ul
></li
><li>Conservator 2d10<ul><li>Well-travelled. The power she's been entrusted with is a source of strength for her; she almost seems to relish it. Perhaps a reason for some of her behaviours.</li></ul
></li
><li>Well-guarded 3d4<ul><li>Very good at not talking about herself. Doesn't like it when conversations get personal. More present and vibrant failures plague her, too: The sense of inadequacy fostered by her inability to help Jun and Ayako against Kotomi has only reinforced the insecurities that led to her walling up in the first place.</li></ul
></li
><li>Grudging respect d6 (initation)<ul><li>She doesn't like doing it, but she'll heed the advice of those with more experience.<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
><u>Relationships</u><br
/><ul><li>Former friends 1d8<ul><li>Grew up in what became a witch area. Sort of run down to begin with. Suffered socially growing up, and eventually things got dire between her and her friends. At this point, she was extended a contract by a Familiar after the Familiar noticed that she suffered substantially weaker symptoms than those at her high school; a possible indication of magic potential. In return for solving...some central element to the witch's power, the Familiar fast-tracked the emotional revitalization of her community. She, however, had grown bitter and confrontational along the years, made worse by this first assignment; as those around her healed, she became distant, unable to separate her magical-girl problem-solving tendencies from her day to day behaviour.&nbsp; She's spurred more enthusiastically into action when she sees people suffering from similar problems in her travels. Perhaps is spurred to be more considerate, as well.</li></ul
></li
><li>Jun 1d4<ul><li>Reflecting on her work with Jun just reminds Hitomi of the results of her cowardice.</li></ul

><u>Belongings</u><br
/><ul><li>Costume - 2d6<ul><li><a href="http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/2109/122777-63559_biomega_03_122_598lo.jpg">http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/2109/122777-63559_biomega_03_122_598lo.jpg</a> with some modifications, in particular - no apron.</li

><li>(olddesc) Hitomi's costume can be best described as Gigeresque. Above the waist it looks much like a ballgown. Below the waist, it resolves in a short skirt - almost more like a fauld - complimented by what can be best described as leggings and boots. The entire outfit - both the softer parts and the slightly bulkier knee-high "boots" - appear to be weaved deep red "tendrils", with her joints, forearms and shins protected by large, harder thorns.</li></ul
></li
><li>Weapon - 2d6 + d4 - Meteor Flail<ul><li>A meteor hammer that can, terrifyingly quickly, retract into a one-handed flail. This weapon is imposing on its own and becomes moreso in her altogether too-experienced hands.</li></ul
></li
><li>Fancy lighter 1d6?<ul><li>Treasured, chunky, old, aluminum lighter. Flips open and closed w ith all manner of alluring metallic sounds. Burns with a large flame. Has seen better days, but remains clockwork. She's replaced the flint a few times manually.</li></ul
></li
><li>Extensible baton 1d6<ul><li>Her favourite less-than-lethal motivator. Clips onto belt loops, looks pretty innocuous to the untrained eye. [I was going to have this as my magical weapon's non-aethereal manifestation, but...]</li></ul
></li
><li>Miniature spray can 1d6<ul><li>Something home-made she bought off someone a while back. A diminuative spraycan that rivals her lighter in size. Refills from below; she keeps it wrapped up to prevent it from messing up the inside of her purse. Useful for discretely placing more permanent runes where needed.</li

>A girl who developed a habit of throwing herself in harm's way, out of compassion for those growing up in the same unfortunate circumstances that she did. She has the physical strength and tenacity to make her self-sacrifice worth something... most of the time. Her reasoning and magical abilities suffer, though, from the stress of doing this constantly. Neither does she easily forgive those whom she feels have wronged her or her allies.<br

/><ul><li>Dead Boyfriend - 3d4<ul><li>KINOSHITA Takeshi / 木下 武</li
><li>They made their wishes together and became magical kids together. In a small group they managed to hold off witches for a while, but he became corrupted in the process and eventually witchified. She was forced to destroy him. She refuses to let more people die this way.</li></ul

><li>TAKANASHI Shizuka / 高梨 静香</li

></li
><li>Kotomi - 1d4<ul><li>Kotomi reminds Jun too much of herself. They come from similar situations and have opposite response. Jun can see what she risks becoming in Kotomi.</li></ul

><li>Available - 1d4 1d6 1d8 1d10<br/><br
/></li></ul
><u>Belongings</u><br
/><ul><li>Costume - 1d6<ul><li>A mish-mash of samurai armor and informal garmets. A sleeveless gray tunic and dark purple hakama form the base layer while outer layers are built out of armor that doesn't always appear to be entirely connected to her outfit. The spaulders hang around her bare arms and her forearms and hands are bound with leather strips. An armored skirt protects her legs. All of the armor looks faintly damaged and dented, like it's seen too many battles without repair.</li></ul
></li
><li>Shinai - 1d6</li
><li>Cracked Ring - 1d4<ul><li>The remnants of her boyfriend's magical focus. She wears it on a chain around her neck.</li></ul
></li
><li>The Book of Five Rings - 1d6<ul><li>Full of notes in the margins with little words of encouragement to herself mixed with notes about tactics.</li></ul
></li
><li>Lipstick - 1d6<ul><li>Uses it to draw magical seals and to make herself feel pretty when she's feeling down.<br/><br

>A by-the-book girl who strongly values order and reason. She has a good head on her shoulders, and can be stubborn when it comes to discussing the details of her job in the abstract, but is relatively inexperienced when it comes to handling truly messy, violent, or emotionally fraught situations.<br

><b>HIIRAGI Hikari / 柊 光</b> <b>(ALICIA)</b><br
/>Background: Strong Community<br
/><br
/>Relatively new not only to conservatorship, but to magic as a whole. She makes up for this by being quite good at cultivating the appearance of competence, even if that means she has to make up a few details, or step on a few toes. This isn't to say that she's <i>not</i> competent, not at all, but when she gets in over her head (and she does have a tendency to get in over her head), she quickly loses her composure. She has a persistent insecurity stemming from the dichotomy between the facade and who she knows she actually is — but from her usual bubbly, outgoing personality, you'd hardly be able to tell.<br

><b>WAKAHISA Hibiki / 若久 響 (SALADOFSTONES)</b><br
/>Background: Complicated Community<br
/><br
/>A proud, fiercely independent girl who's been around the magical block once or twice. She finds her non-magical life rather constricting, and so looks to her powers, and especially her position as Conservator, as a source of meaning in life. Hibiki lost her Conservatorship for some time before the beginning of the campaign, after being forced to take the fall for a botched mission — it was either falsely admitting guilt and getting to retain her magical abilities, or sticking to her guns and losing them. Only recently was she reinstated. She generally plays her cards quite close to her chest, but occasionally her affinity for detective stories and Soviet history leaks out, much to her chagrin.<br
