/><br
/><br
/><b>YANO Hitomi / 矢野 瞳 (BARCODE)</b><br
/><br
/>Background: Complicated History<br
/><br
/><u>Stats</u><br
/><ul><li>ACUITY: 4d6<ul><li>Life on the streets necessitated quick thinking and a constant eye out for an escape. This mental agility helps to improvise in magical situations as well.</li></ul
></li
><li>BODY: 4d6<ul><li>A fast body follows a fast mind. This character is fairly quick and is also used to less than ideal physical conditions. Might have a bit of a healing factor working in her favor, too.</li></ul
></li
><li>HEART: 2d6<ul><li>In order to live with the consequences of your own actions, you either accept what you've done as emotional baggage, or do whatever you can to bury your thoughts on the matter. Guess who doesn't have much to say when feelings come out.</li></ul
></li
><li>WILL: 5d6<ul><li>Self-taught intimidator and vicious in a fight, this character has earned fixer status by consistently beating the hate and fear out of her objectives, physically or mentally. She has the faculties necessary to deal with the redirected animosity, too.<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
>A devious, physical character who prefers to get things done by any means possible, even if it means walking over some feelings. Very emotionally guarded.<br
/><br
/>The oldest of the three Conservators in the group, at 20.<br
/><br
/><u>Kept dice</u>: None<br
/><br
/><u>Traits</u><br
/><ul><li>Narcotics aficionado 2d4<ul><li>Smokes. Drinks. Gets a bit restless when she can't have one or the other.</li></ul
></li
><li>Brawler 2d6<ul><li>Well-experienced in causing impacts between the harder parts of her limbs and the softer parts of her opponents.</li></ul
></li
><li>Conservator 2d10<ul><li>Well-travelled. The power she's been entrusted with is a source of strength for her; she almost seems to relish it. Perhaps a reason for some of her behaviours.</li></ul
></li
><li>Well-guarded 3d4<ul><li>Very good at not talking about herself. Doesn't like it when conversations get personal. More present and vibrant failures plague her, too: The sense of inadequacy fostered by her inability to help Jun and Ayako against Kotomi has only reinforced the insecurities that led to her walling up in the first place.</li></ul
></li
><li>Grudging respect d6 (initation)<ul><li>She doesn't like doing it, but she'll heed the advice of those with more experience.<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
><u>Relationships</u><br
/><ul><li>Former friends 1d8<ul><li>Grew up in what became a witch area. Sort of run down to begin with. Suffered socially growing up, and eventually things got dire between her and her friends. At this point, she was extended a contract by a Familiar after the Familiar noticed that she suffered substantially weaker symptoms than those at her high school; a possible indication of magic potential. In return for solving...some central element to the witch's power, the Familiar fast-tracked the emotional revitalization of her community. She, however, had grown bitter and confrontational along the years, made worse by this first assignment; as those around her healed, she became distant, unable to separate her magical-girl problem-solving tendencies from her day to day behaviour.&nbsp; She's spurred more enthusiastically into action when she sees people suffering from similar problems in her travels. Perhaps is spurred to be more considerate, as well.</li></ul
></li
><li>Jun 1d4<ul><li>Reflecting on her work with Jun just reminds Hitomi of the results of her cowardice.</li></ul

><u>Belongings</u><br
/><ul><li>Costume - 2d6<ul><li><a href="http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/2109/122777-63559_biomega_03_122_598lo.jpg">http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/2109/122777-63559_biomega_03_122_598lo.jpg</a> with some modifications, in particular - no apron.</li

><li>(olddesc) Hitomi's costume can be best described as Gigeresque. Above the waist it looks much like a ballgown. Below the waist, it resolves in a short skirt - almost more like a fauld - complimented by what can be best described as leggings and boots. The entire outfit - both the softer parts and the slightly bulkier knee-high "boots" - appear to be weaved deep red "tendrils", with her joints, forearms and shins protected by large, harder thorns.</li></ul
></li
><li>Weapon - 2d6 + d4 - Meteor Flail<ul><li>A meteor hammer that can, terrifyingly quickly, retract into a one-handed flail. This weapon is imposing on its own and becomes moreso in her altogether too-experienced hands.</li></ul
></li
><li>Fancy lighter 1d6?<ul><li>Treasured, chunky, old, aluminum lighter. Flips open and closed w ith all manner of alluring metallic sounds. Burns with a large flame. Has seen better days, but remains clockwork. She's replaced the flint a few times manually.</li></ul
></li
><li>Extensible baton 1d6<ul><li>Her favourite less-than-lethal motivator. Clips onto belt loops, looks pretty innocuous to the untrained eye. [I was going to have this as my magical weapon's non-aethereal manifestation, but...]</li></ul
></li
><li>Miniature spray can 1d6<ul><li>Something home-made she bought off someone a while back. A diminuative spraycan that rivals her lighter in size. Refills from below; she keeps it wrapped up to prevent it from messing up the inside of her purse. Useful for discretely placing more permanent runes where needed.</li

>A girl who developed a habit of throwing herself in harm's way, out of compassion for those growing up in the same unfortunate circumstances that she did. She has the physical strength and tenacity to make her self-sacrifice worth something... most of the time. Her reasoning and magical abilities suffer, though, from the stress of doing this constantly. Neither does she easily forgive those whom she feels have wronged her or her allies.<br
/><br

><u>Relationships</u><br
/><ul><li>Dead Boyfriend - 3d4<ul><li>KINOSHITA Takeshi / 木下 武</li
><li>They made their wishes together and became magical kids together. In a small group they managed to hold off witches for a while, but he became corrupted in the process and eventually witchified. She was forced to destroy him. She refuses to let more people die this way.</li></ul
></li
><li>Mother - 1d10<ul><li>Overrides default 1d6 for blood relations</li
><li>TAKANASHI Shizuka / 高梨 静香</li
><li>Her mother doesn't know what she does with her time, but she was there throughout the ordeals she's faced and acts as a point of courage and support.</li></ul
></li
><li>Non-magical civilians - 1d8<ul><li>She won't stand for innocents getting hurt while she does her job.</li></ul
></li
><li>Hitomi - 1d6<ul><li>They've each reached some sort of understanding about how the other operates. While they may not always agree or even seem friendly they do at least work as a team.</li></ul
></li
><li>Ayako - 1d6<ul><li>Ayako managed to save Jun when she was foolhardy enough to risk her own life. Jun owes her.</li></ul
></li
><li>Kotomi - 1d4<ul><li>Kotomi reminds Jun too much of herself. They come from similar situations and have opposite response. Jun can see what she risks becoming in Kotomi.</li></ul
></li
><li>Available - 1d4 1d6 1d8 1d10<br/><br
/></li></ul
><u>Belongings</u><br
/><ul><li>Costume - 1d6<ul><li>A mish-mash of samurai armor and informal garmets. A sleeveless gray tunic and dark purple hakama form the base layer while outer layers are built out of armor that doesn't always appear to be entirely connected to her outfit. The spaulders hang around her bare arms and her forearms and hands are bound with leather strips. An armored skirt protects her legs. All of the armor looks faintly damaged and dented, like it's seen too many battles without repair.</li></ul
></li
><li>Shinai - 1d6</li
><li>Cracked Ring - 1d4<ul><li>The remnants of her boyfriend's magical focus. She wears it on a chain around her neck.</li></ul
></li
><li>The Book of Five Rings - 1d6<ul><li>Full of notes in the margins with little words of encouragement to herself mixed with notes about tactics.</li></ul
></li
><li>Lipstick - 1d6<ul><li>Uses it to draw magical seals and to make herself feel pretty when she's feeling down.<br/><br

><li>Even before contracting, Ayako was not exactly known as a social butterfly, and having to keep the secret of her magic from the world just made things even more difficult, though the growing link to Jun seems to have opened her up at least a little bit.</li></ul

><li>WILL: 3d6</li></ul
>A by-the-book girl who strongly values order and reason. She has a good head on her shoulders, and can be stubborn when it comes to discussing the details of her job in the abstract, but is relatively inexperienced when it comes to handling truly messy, violent, or emotionally fraught situations.<br

><li>MUKAI Yurika / 向井 百合香 1d8<ul><li>close friend of the mentor who initially doubted Ayako, came to think "maybe she has potential after all"; proving the latter assertion right and the earlier sentiment wrong stays close to her mind</li></ul

><b>HIIRAGI Hikari (ALICIA)</b><br
/>Background: Strong Community<br
/><br
/>Relatively new not only to conservatorship, but to magic as a whole. She makes up for this by being quite good at cultivating the appearance of competence, even if that means she has to make up a few details, or step on a few toes. This isn't to say that she isn't competent, not at all, but when she gets in over her head (and she does have a tendency to get in over her head), she quickly loses her composure. She has a persistent insecurity at the dichotomy between the personality she projects and who she knows she actually is.<br

/><ul><li>1d4&nbsp; Cracks when the conflict is directed at her.<ul><li>She's not the best once things get serious, and fears the worst of her actions. Probably wouldn't enjoy being treated as she treats others once she starts getting really emotional. Sure she might&nbsp;</li></ul
></li
><li>1d6 Believes in the good of other people.<ul><li>Or at least, desperately wishes to see the goodness in others. Thus, given all the bad things in the world and her status as a conservator, leads to some internal conflicts.</li></ul

><u>Traits</u><br
/>traits 6d6 2d8<br
/><ul><li>1d8: Has a strong interest in history and knack for applying it<ul><li>She fell in love with history because of the challenge. Aside from learning about the world from scraps of paper, she loved reading between the lines, and figuring out not only what was true, but what people thought was true. The nerd that she was, she tried applying this to her daily life and learned she had a talent for it. This lead to a greater understanding that humans don't change, and that there will always be those who lead others and those who are led. With all that talent, who else would be fitting for the former but her?</li></ul
></li
><li>1d8: Bureacracy manipulation<ul><li>She grew up in a large family, with 5 other siblings. The conflict of personalities, and limited attention her parents could give meant that, since she couldn't be the loudest, she had to be the most clever. As she grew older and the family gave away to school, and later to the magical world, knowing how to use bureacracy and when to avoid it became critical.&nbsp;</li></ul
></li
><li>1d6:&nbsp;</li
><li>1d6: I love this job (Conservator), it reminds me of napalm in the morning<ul><li>From a young age, she hated feeling dictated by others. What started as a simple immature deliquancy became an deeply engrained issue, and being in a position wher she controls others, down to their life potentially, is liberating. Has been doing this for a long time, knows how this works, and has no desire to retire before death. She loves the power assigned to her and how much she can control the world outside using her own will.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul
></li
><li>2d6: Is a nerd for Soviet history<ul><li>Her father was a professor in Russian history, and way back when, had communist symapthies.&nbsp; Although these carried over, she also loves very pop things, like soviet military uniforms and gear. Also loves eastern european looking people, its a weakness. URA<br/><br

><u>Relationships</u><br

/><ul><li>2d6 Dear old Dad<ul><li>Way back when, her dad was part of the communist movement within Japan. Although dedicated to the cause, he made the choice between sticking with the cause or settling with his family. He chose his family, a wife, and five kids. His love for russian, especially Soviet history, fascinated Hibiki. For Hibiki, he represents all that she wants and all she wants to avoid. She does think highly of all the times they talked and the time they spent. No real connections with the rest of her family.</li></ul
></li
><li>1d8: Her betrayers, 'dearest of all my friends'<ul><li>Within any organizations, factions form. Her faction supported the expansion of the use of magic into more elements of muggle life. As it was, it was both convienent for her interests and align with her views to support this faction.&nbsp;</li></ul
