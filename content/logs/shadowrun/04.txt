[21-Dec-2014 21:01:35]  <jseblan> in a minute
[21-Dec-2014 21:01:52]  <jseblan> okay
[21-Dec-2014 21:04:24]  <Rig> IllFlower: What were you up to anyway? More school stuff?
[21-Dec-2014 21:05:16]  <IllFlower> No, I had to clean up some stuff at home.
[21-Dec-2014 21:05:24]  <Rig> Ah.
[21-Dec-2014 21:05:37]  <Rig> BGTB2005: You around? I heard you were hype, but I'm not seeing it.
[21-Dec-2014 21:06:22]  <BGTB2005> i'm here
[21-Dec-2014 21:06:25]  <BGTB2005> I'm hype~
[21-Dec-2014 21:06:35]  <Rig> Okay, I suppose we'll get started then.
[21-Dec-2014 21:07:05]  <Rig> In the few weeks since you entered the cab you've driven the entire length of Hangzhou multiple times. The cabbie refuses to stop.
[21-Dec-2014 21:07:28]  <Rig> Okay, but seriously.
[21-Dec-2014 21:07:59]  <jseblan> "the elevator broke and it took a month to repair it"
[21-Dec-2014 21:08:47]  <Rig> The cab pulls up to the warehouse where you first met your Mr. Johnson. The doors are open this time and the lights inside are on. Mr. Johnson stands near the door, waiting for your group to arrive with his package.
[21-Dec-2014 21:09:33]  <IllFlower> "Unusually timely for a Johnson," Malcolm quips.
[21-Dec-2014 21:09:34]  <Rig> Inside the warehouse you can see people moving about. Most of them appear to be warehouse workers going about their daily business, but a few men stand around fidgeting with things hidden in their coat pockets.
[21-Dec-2014 21:10:55]  <jseblan> is there some way to subtly check what they're doing?
[21-Dec-2014 21:11:03]  <IllFlower> Malcolm tosses a glance in Antoine and Koishi's direction.
[21-Dec-2014 21:11:20]  <Rig> The dwarf cabbie looks to Malcolm (the only one who looks like he could pay) and taps the meter. The display reads 50 nuyen.
[21-Dec-2014 21:11:46]  <Rig> jseblan: Which ones?
[21-Dec-2014 21:11:59]  <jseblan> the guys fidgeting
[21-Dec-2014 21:12:35]  <Rig> How subtle do you want to be about it? I mean, you're in a cab.
[21-Dec-2014 21:13:03]  <jseblan> I get out and scream "HEY WHAT'S THAT IN YOUR POCKET GUYS??!" /joke
[21-Dec-2014 21:13:16]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking we ask the cabbie to stay here in case thigns go south.
[21-Dec-2014 21:13:45]  <IllFlower> Worst comes to worst, we have to fling his dead body out of the cab before we flee in it.
[21-Dec-2014 21:14:05]  <Rig> Wow, way to be insensitive to metahumans.
[21-Dec-2014 21:14:13]  <Rig> You can do that though.
[21-Dec-2014 21:14:38]  <jseblan> Rig: how known is the quintuplet's possible links to dragons or whatever? could Antoine know, being from Quebec?
[21-Dec-2014 21:15:29]  <IllFlower> Rig: Well, if those things in the pockets are guns, he'll probably be the first to die in the crossfire.
[21-Dec-2014 21:15:32]  <Rig> He probably knows some rumors which are pretty common knowledge.
[21-Dec-2014 21:15:48]  <Rig> IllFlower: Nah, Antoine has a habit of being the first to get shot.
[21-Dec-2014 21:15:53]  <IllFlower> Burn.
[21-Dec-2014 21:16:23]  <jseblan> French Canadians die first, new movie trope
[21-Dec-2014 21:16:50]  <IllFlower> "Can you stay here for a bit? We might have to get going again soon," Malcolm says to the driver.
[21-Dec-2014 21:17:59]  <Rig> The dwarf shrugs, "I'm keeping the meter going."
[21-Dec-2014 21:18:19]  <jseblan> Antoine taps the dwarf's shoulder and adds "you'll get a good tip, don't worry"
[21-Dec-2014 21:18:40]  <jseblan> He then gives a side glance to Mal
[21-Dec-2014 21:18:55]  <Rig> The dwarf gives Antoine a once over and then flashes a doubtful smile.
[21-Dec-2014 21:19:02]  <IllFlower> Malcolm smiles awkwardly. "Yeah. Sure."
[21-Dec-2014 21:20:08]  <IllFlower> Do we want to chance just walking up and seeing what's going on?
[21-Dec-2014 21:20:29]  <Rig> I mean, this is where you're supposed to be.
[21-Dec-2014 21:22:09]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but, you know, suspicion.
[21-Dec-2014 21:22:27]  <Rig> A good thing, I suppose.
[21-Dec-2014 21:22:31]  <IllFlower> I guess talking is Malcolm's job, so let's go.
[21-Dec-2014 21:22:34]  <Rig> You could leave some of them in the car.
[21-Dec-2014 21:22:41]  <BGTB2005> I'm not sure if one of my knowledge skills might be relevant?
[21-Dec-2014 21:23:10]  <Rig> Ambush might be handy.
[21-Dec-2014 21:23:37]  <jseblan> use your music skill to determine these guys are fidgeting with kazoos
[21-Dec-2014 21:23:54]  <Rig> Heh.
[21-Dec-2014 21:23:55]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[21-Dec-2014 21:24:07]  <IllFlower> Leave some of what in the car?
[21-Dec-2014 21:24:24]  <jseblan> some of the girl. just bring half.
[21-Dec-2014 21:24:28]  <jseblan> sorry
[21-Dec-2014 21:24:35]  <IllFlower> Grim.
[21-Dec-2014 21:24:39]  <Rig> Your team. But Koishi could use her knowledge skill to check if it looks like an ambush.
[21-Dec-2014 21:24:40]  <BGTB2005> I say leave Antoine in the car; they probably won't shoot at it
[21-Dec-2014 21:24:52]  <BGTB2005> if we leave the cooler in the trunk as well
[21-Dec-2014 21:26:52]  <BGTB2005> and yeah, i want to roll to check how much of an ambush it looks like
[21-Dec-2014 21:27:01]  <IllFlower> "Koishi, how are you feeling about this?"
[21-Dec-2014 21:27:27]  <Rig> BGTB2005: That's 8d6.
[21-Dec-2014 21:28:06]  <BGTB2005> @dice roll 8d6

[21-Dec-2014 21:28:13]  <BGTB2005> :/
[21-Dec-2014 21:28:33]  <Rig> Koishi can tell that there are definitely people in the warehouse.
[21-Dec-2014 21:28:34]  <BGTB2005> I think the specialisation allows me 10d6 total?
[21-Dec-2014 21:29:18]  <Rig> Oh, yeah, so roll another 2d6
[21-Dec-2014 21:29:26]  <BGTB2005> @dice roll 2d6

[21-Dec-2014 21:29:58]  <Rig> If they're trying to ambush you they're not making a very good job of hiding it.
[21-Dec-2014 21:30:06]  <jseblan> could I use my magic threat skill to see if these guys are mages?
[21-Dec-2014 21:30:15]  <jseblan> knowledge*
[21-Dec-2014 21:30:45]  <Rig> Sure.
[21-Dec-2014 21:31:31]  <Rig> 10d6, I think, jseblan

[21-Dec-2014 21:32:57]  <Rig> None of the men you can see have any of the signs of being magically skilled at all. Mr. Johnson is still a complete mystery to you though.
[21-Dec-2014 21:34:19]  <IllFlower> Malcolm finally decides to open the door and step out of the cab.
[21-Dec-2014 21:35:14]  <Rig> The men open fire immeadiately.
[21-Dec-2014 21:35:22]  <Rig> /joke
[21-Dec-2014 21:35:29]  <IllFlower> "Your delivery's in the back," he says to the Johnson.
[21-Dec-2014 21:37:23]  <Rig> Mr. Johnson raises an eyebrow almost imperceptibly. "It didn't take you nearly as long as expected." He gestures and a few of the men move forward. They have Triad tattoos on their arms and necks. "Help the runners bring the package in."
[21-Dec-2014 21:38:58]  <IllFlower> Malcolm fires another glance at Koishi, before walking around to the back and tapping twice on the trunk.
[21-Dec-2014 21:39:38]  <Rig> The driver pops the trunk.
[21-Dec-2014 21:40:07]  <IllFlower> They open it up and a zombie pops out.
[21-Dec-2014 21:40:56]  <Rig> Heh.
[21-Dec-2014 21:41:17]  <Rig> The cooler is about how you left it. It may have slid a little around some of the turns.
[21-Dec-2014 21:41:26]  <Rig> Hopefully, the girl hasn't woken up yet.
[21-Dec-2014 21:41:38]  <jseblan> we'd probably hear it if she did
[21-Dec-2014 21:42:04]  <jseblan> unless she was trained for that kind of situation (in which case she might be told to scream anyway?)
[21-Dec-2014 21:42:31]  <Rig> She's gonna leap out and do some judo.
[21-Dec-2014 21:42:53]  <Rig> Antoine will have to face her in one on one combat.
[21-Dec-2014 21:43:08]  <IllFlower> Malcolm tilts his head to indicate the cooler.
[21-Dec-2014 21:43:50]  <jseblan> Rig: I get shot despite no guns being fired anywhere in my direction
[21-Dec-2014 21:44:10]  <Rig> The two men look a little apprehensively at the cooler. They could have sworn the job was to bring back the girls alive. Nonetheless, the two of them take the cooler between them and carry it back toward the warehouse.

[21-Dec-2014 21:45:23]  <IllFlower> "The cargo's been put on ice for shipping," Malcolm says. "I recommend you unpack it before it thaws."
[21-Dec-2014 21:45:44]  <jseblan> microwave five minutes at high-intensity
[21-Dec-2014 21:45:55]  <jseblan> sorry again
[21-Dec-2014 21:45:55]  <Rig> Time vary based on microwave model and age.
[21-Dec-2014 21:46:35]  <Rig> Mr Johnson gives Malcolm a look. "It is... fresh, correct?"
[21-Dec-2014 21:46:58]  <BGTB2005> ("It was when we put it in there.")
[21-Dec-2014 21:47:18]  <IllFlower> "Of course. We don't ship expired goods."
[21-Dec-2014 21:48:06]  <Rig> Mr Johnson nods. "Follow me then." He turns and leads the cooler-toting Triads into the warehouse.
[21-Dec-2014 21:48:55]  <jseblan> Antoine is still in the cab?
[21-Dec-2014 21:49:14]  <Rig> I believe so.

[21-Dec-2014 21:49:25]  <BGTB2005> Koishi too I believe
[21-Dec-2014 21:49:37]  <IllFlower> You're not just going to leave Malcolm to handle this himself, are you?
[21-Dec-2014 21:49:43]  <BGTB2005> she might want to follow in case things go downhill
[21-Dec-2014 21:49:55]  <Rig> Nah, let Malcolm smooth talk his way into this.
[21-Dec-2014 21:50:26]  <IllFlower> Malcolm makes a beckoning hand gesture back towards Koishi in the car.
[21-Dec-2014 21:50:42]  <Rig> Splitting the group?
[21-Dec-2014 21:53:27]  <IllFlower> I wouldn't mind if Antoine comes too. Though Antoine might.
[21-Dec-2014 21:54:11]  <jseblan> Antoine sees Koishi leave the cab, hesitates a few seconds then follows the group into the warehouse
[21-Dec-2014 21:54:12]  <Rig> Well, before we do that, let me ask a question: how quickly do you want to wrap up this game?
[21-Dec-2014 21:55:05]  <jseblan> "do I kill everyone now or later?"
[21-Dec-2014 21:55:31]  <IllFlower> As quickly as the plot demands. :p
[21-Dec-2014 21:55:34]  <Rig> Heh.
[21-Dec-2014 21:55:39]  <Rig> Okay. 
[21-Dec-2014 21:56:03]  <Rig> The cabbie looks at the meter and shrugs as Antoine follows the group into the warehouse.
[21-Dec-2014 21:56:48]  <Rig> Mr Johnson leads the band through stacks of pallets and containers that seem to make up a winding maze intended to disorient.
[21-Dec-2014 21:58:01]  <Rig> Finally, the group reaches an open space surrounded on all sides by stacked cargo containers. Men with rifles stand on top of these while a set of bright sodium lights cast a yellow hue over the figures of a trio of what are clearly shamans standing in the center of the area.
[21-Dec-2014 21:58:37]  <IllFlower> "Looks like a party," Malcolm says, raising an eyebrow.
[21-Dec-2014 21:58:38]  <Rig> Mr Johnson stops while the men with the cooler take it into the center of the shamans.
[21-Dec-2014 21:59:20]  <Rig> Mr Johnson gives him a smile, "We were just waiting for the guest of honor."
[21-Dec-2014 22:00:06]  <BGTB2005> Koishi attempts to keep near the entryway they came through
[21-Dec-2014 22:00:07]  <jseblan> I do the most pointless magic threat roll ever
[21-Dec-2014 22:00:23]  <Rig> The men open the cooler to find a rather scrunched Shui. They check her pulse briefly to confirm she's still alive before unloading her into the center of a circle of runes near the shamans.
[21-Dec-2014 22:00:29]  <Rig> jseblan: Go ahead. :P
[21-Dec-2014 22:00:36]  <jseblan> @dice roll 10d6

[21-Dec-2014 22:01:33]  <jseblan> yes

[21-Dec-2014 22:03:24]  <Rig> Antoine recognizes the runes as a "holding cell" of sorts. They can contain any attempts to reach out through the astral plane. It seems like they're placing some faith into the rumors of the Quints extrasensory skills.
[21-Dec-2014 22:03:51]  <Rig> The fact that they brought three shamans to run the thing is a bit odd though.
[21-Dec-2014 22:05:27]  <jseblan> Antoine becomes slightly less tense as he recognizes the runes as nothing more than a cautious measure, but he still eyes the shamans suspiciously
[21-Dec-2014 22:06:09]  <Rig> IllFlower: Could you roll for your Local Politics skill?
[21-Dec-2014 22:06:36]  <Rig> It's 8d6, I believe.
[21-Dec-2014 22:07:38]  <IllFlower> Okay.
[21-Dec-2014 22:08:06]  <IllFlower> I have rating 4, if that helps.
[21-Dec-2014 22:08:33]  <IllFlower> I'm looking through the manual and I'm not sure how many dice I should roll myself, so let's just go 8d6.
[21-Dec-2014 22:08:36]  <IllFlower> @dice roll 8d6
[21-Dec-2014 22:08:36]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 1 2 2 3 4 5 5 6 = 28.
[21-Dec-2014 22:09:48]  <IllFlower> 3 hits.
[21-Dec-2014 22:09:55]  <Rig> Malcolm recognizes that the men in the room all belong to the Triads.
[21-Dec-2014 22:10:14]  <IllFlower> He wasn't already under that impression?
[21-Dec-2014 22:11:38]  <Rig> Mr Johnson turns to the runners, "You've done well on the first part of the job. We need some time to set up our ransom note. You can get some rest and see the sights in Lower Hangzhou. We'll contact you when we're ready to broadcast."
[21-Dec-2014 22:12:38]  <IllFlower> "And miss the festivities in here?" Malcolm asks, in as serious a voice as he can muster.
[21-Dec-2014 22:13:34]  <Rig> "Oh, you're interested in trid productions?"
[21-Dec-2014 22:15:06]  <IllFlower> "Why pass up the opportunity?"
[21-Dec-2014 22:15:18]  <jseblan> trid?
[21-Dec-2014 22:15:31]  <IllFlower> Like TV, except more.
[21-Dec-2014 22:15:41]  <Rig> Shadowrun's slang for video things. Everything is 3D in the future.
[21-Dec-2014 22:16:06]  <jseblan> oh
[21-Dec-2014 22:17:02]  <Rig> "You can feel free to remain," Mr Johnson says. "I have other business to attend to however."
[21-Dec-2014 22:17:47]  <Rig> "Ask one of the guards if you need anything," he says as he rounds the corner and disappears from sight.
[21-Dec-2014 22:18:12]  <BGTB2005> Koishi glances at Malcolm, trying to convey her discomfort with the current situation
[21-Dec-2014 22:19:58]  <IllFlower> "Don't look at me," Malcolm says in Japanese. "This seems more like Antoine's jam."
[21-Dec-2014 22:22:59]  <Rig> The men on top of the containers glance nervously at your group. The shamans mostly ignore you however.
[21-Dec-2014 22:23:41]  <Rig> After a few moments another group of men (most of them lacking the tattoos that mark them as Triad) come in and start to fuss with equipment stacked in a corner.
[21-Dec-2014 22:23:45]  <jseblan> Antoine looks at Mal and sees Koishi's worry. He tries to calm them. "It's just some magic version of a signal jammer.", he tells Malcolm. He then approaches him and whispers: "You don't usually need three shamans for that though."
[21-Dec-2014 22:26:33]  <IllFlower> "So what are the other two for?" Malcolm whispers back.
[21-Dec-2014 22:29:11]  <jseblan> Antoine shrugs. "Either the girl's way weird or it's about to get real fucked up here", whispering again.
[21-Dec-2014 22:30:12]  <IllFlower> Malcolm makes a face. "Yeah. I love the smell of fuckedupness in the morning."
[21-Dec-2014 22:30:26]  <Rig> Shui tosses about in the runes, seeming like she's coming to. The two shamans not already focused on the circle jump to attention and take their places. The runes glow faintly, but it could just be the harsh light reflecting off the paint.
[21-Dec-2014 22:31:11]  <jseblan> can I use my knowledge again to determine who of three shamans is the leader, if any?
[21-Dec-2014 22:31:21]  <jseblan> who of the*
[21-Dec-2014 22:31:34]  <Rig> Shui slowly sits up and tries to stretch. Being shoved into a cooler isn't good for anyone.
[21-Dec-2014 22:31:58]  <Rig> jseblan: You can try, but it's fairly unlikely you can determine that.
[21-Dec-2014 22:32:10]  <jseblan> myeah... nevermind then
[21-Dec-2014 22:32:32]  <Rig> Shui slowly takes in her surroundings, trying to get a grasp on the situation. Eventually her eyes fall on Malcolm and she frowns.
[21-Dec-2014 22:32:42]  <Rig> "You lied to me," she says.

[21-Dec-2014 22:39:10]  <Rig> "Don't you know anything about Wuxing?" she asks.
[21-Dec-2014 22:40:45]  <IllFlower> "You're not all that imaginative if ransom is the worst you think we can do," Malcolm says coldly.
[21-Dec-2014 22:40:56]  <IllFlower> He glances around the room, wondering if anyone else has caught on yet.
[21-Dec-2014 22:43:35]  <Rig> Shui smiles, "I can imagine what my father will do to you."
[21-Dec-2014 22:44:00]  <BGTB2005> small question; is the conversation in Mandarin or Cantonese?
[21-Dec-2014 22:45:08]  <Rig> Mandarin. Much to dismay of Antoine.
[21-Dec-2014 22:45:25]  <IllFlower> "I am but a cog. I may break, but the machine grinds on."
[21-Dec-2014 22:46:25]  <Rig> "So humble," Shui mutters. She looks around at the men guarding her, ignoring Malcolm now.
[21-Dec-2014 22:46:58]  <Rig> The men setting up the equipment have managed to set up a small, but complicated looking camera array.
[21-Dec-2014 22:47:18]  <Rig> It's going to be a well produced ransom note apparently.
[21-Dec-2014 22:50:14]  <Rig> Shui looks back at the runners. "You were hired by Triads to kidnap me?"
[21-Dec-2014 22:51:08]  <IllFlower> Malcolm says nothing.
[21-Dec-2014 22:51:54]  <Rig> "You really don't know anything about Wuxing at all, do you?"
[21-Dec-2014 22:52:18]  <IllFlower> Still nothing.
[21-Dec-2014 22:53:14]  <Rig> Shui smiles, "Wuxing owns all the Triads in Hangzhou, you know?"
[21-Dec-2014 22:53:49]  <jseblan> Rig: can I do a perception check on the girl to see if there's anything odd about her?
[21-Dec-2014 22:53:49]  <Rig> One of the men moving a light stumbles briefly.
[21-Dec-2014 22:53:55]  <Rig> Sure.
[21-Dec-2014 22:53:57]  <IllFlower> Not even a raised eyebrow.

[21-Dec-2014 23:07:30]  <IllFlower> "I don't think I can compete with that," Malcolm says, dropping his act.
[21-Dec-2014 23:07:54]  <IllFlower> "I'm surprised you can still get a job doing trid special effects."
[21-Dec-2014 23:08:09]  <Rig> Heh.
[21-Dec-2014 23:08:42]  <Rig> Buffalo is standing in the center of runes now, guarding Shui. The shamans are dead.
[21-Dec-2014 23:09:08]  <jseblan> Buffalo is Mal's troll buddy, right?
[21-Dec-2014 23:09:12]  <Rig> Yeah.
[21-Dec-2014 23:10:08]  <Rig> On the containers above Buffalo you can see a squad of Wuxing operatives with their rifles trained on the guards and yourselves.
[21-Dec-2014 23:10:33]  <Rig> I believe BGTB2005 has the first move.
[21-Dec-2014 23:12:30]  <BGTB2005> I elect to get to some actual cover for my first action
[21-Dec-2014 23:12:37]  <BGTB2005> if possible
[21-Dec-2014 23:13:16]  <Rig> Okay, there are the cases that were holding the trid equipment, you can also head back into the maze of containers and take cover around one of the corners.
[21-Dec-2014 23:13:54]  <BGTB2005> I think the maze is less exposed?
[21-Dec-2014 23:14:30]  <Rig> It is. It's also not well lit at the moment.
[21-Dec-2014 23:14:45]  <Rig> The only light right now are the lights for the ransom video.

[21-Dec-2014 23:18:37]  <BGTB2005> we did remember to map it on our commlinks, right?
[21-Dec-2014 23:19:07]  <Rig> Heh. Sure. I'll let you have your original path through it recorded on your commlink.
[21-Dec-2014 23:19:33]  <Rig> Okay, so what's your action?
[21-Dec-2014 23:21:22]  <BGTB2005> second action this pass?

[21-Dec-2014 23:22:00]  <Rig> Okay, so you're just heading into the maze but not very deep.
[21-Dec-2014 23:22:57]  <Rig> Koishi ducks into the maze, taking cover and readying her gun.
[21-Dec-2014 23:23:35]  <Rig> Buffalo draws his Predator and takes aim at one of the guards standing on the container to his right.

[21-Dec-2014 23:27:45]  <jseblan> please don't say that
[21-Dec-2014 23:27:48]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[21-Dec-2014 23:27:48]  <jseblan> ;_;
[21-Dec-2014 23:28:26]  <IllFlower> Is there any remaining value in anyone on the other side staying alive?
[21-Dec-2014 23:29:05]  <Rig> Well, it certainly looks like you've been lead into a trap.
[21-Dec-2014 23:29:24]  <Rig> Shui is valuable, of course.
[21-Dec-2014 23:29:30]  <Rig> But how valuable is up to you.
[21-Dec-2014 23:29:57]  <IllFlower> Shouldn't have decided to stay for the shoot.
[21-Dec-2014 23:30:16]  * Rig smiles.
[21-Dec-2014 23:30:31]  <BGTB2005> but then we probably wouldn't have gotten paid
[21-Dec-2014 23:30:36]  <IllFlower> Well, if this works anything like Marathon, I elect to spend my actions running around in circles until all of the enemies have accidentally killed each other.
[21-Dec-2014 23:30:45]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[21-Dec-2014 23:31:06]  <Rig> You gain a reflex bonus from moving diagonally.

[21-Dec-2014 23:31:43]  <Rig> Antoine's stuff might actually be handy in an enclosed area like this.
[21-Dec-2014 23:31:47]  <jseblan> on perception or on initiative?
[21-Dec-2014 23:31:51]  <jseblan> oh
[21-Dec-2014 23:31:52]  <Rig> Initiative.
[21-Dec-2014 23:32:20]  <Rig> The perception was... well, you're just getting terrible rolls on the meaningful ones and great rolls on the less important ones.
[21-Dec-2014 23:32:29]  <IllFlower> I suppose taking cover wouldn't be a bad first action.
[21-Dec-2014 23:32:42]  <Rig> Where do you want to do that?
[21-Dec-2014 23:32:45]  <IllFlower> If that is in fact a thing I can do.
[21-Dec-2014 23:32:55]  <BGTB2005> It's what Koishi did
[21-Dec-2014 23:34:05]  <IllFlower> I'll have Malcolm follow Koishi. Because this all might be crazy, but it's her kind of crazy.
[21-Dec-2014 23:34:37]  <Rig> Okay, do you also want to ready a weapon?
[21-Dec-2014 23:36:50]  <IllFlower> Can I quick draw?
[21-Dec-2014 23:37:23]  <Rig> Yeah.
[21-Dec-2014 23:37:38]  <IllFlower> How many enemy guards are there?
[21-Dec-2014 23:38:13]  <Rig> There are six guards on the container above Buffalo.
[21-Dec-2014 23:38:25]  <Rig> Two appear to be better armored than the rest.
[21-Dec-2014 23:38:49]  <BGTB2005> I guess we'll let Malcolm's friend handle those?
[21-Dec-2014 23:39:49]  <Rig> Oh, hang on, lemme make sure I'm clear.
[21-Dec-2014 23:40:16]  <Rig> So, there are 6 Wuxing security guards above Buffalo.
[21-Dec-2014 23:40:28]  <Rig> He shot one of the Triad guards that was there when you first arrived.
[21-Dec-2014 23:41:50]  <IllFlower> I'm going to fire semi-auto at one of the less armored guards.
[21-Dec-2014 23:42:11]  <Rig> Okay, Pistols + Reaction for a quickdraw test.
[21-Dec-2014 23:42:12]  <BGTB2005> so Buffalo's with Wuxing?

[21-Dec-2014 23:42:43]  <BGTB2005> this is not good for us is it
[21-Dec-2014 23:43:05]  <IllFlower> Well, that didn't work.
[21-Dec-2014 23:43:07]  <Rig> Malcolm manages to draw the gun, but fumbles with lining up the shot.
[21-Dec-2014 23:43:41]  <Rig> BGTB2005: Well, Koishi has like 3 passes per round, so... you could still handle this.
[21-Dec-2014 23:43:43]  <Rig> It's just hard.
[21-Dec-2014 23:45:15]  <IllFlower> Rig: I was actually thinking of pulling out the MP5 but presumably that's the same roll.
[21-Dec-2014 23:45:37]  <Rig> IllFlower: You'd just ready it as an action, but you couldn't fire with it.
[21-Dec-2014 23:45:51]  <Rig> Quickdraw just gives you the chance to draw and fire in one action.
[21-Dec-2014 23:46:12]  <IllFlower> Oh, is it too large to quickdraw?
[21-Dec-2014 23:46:13]  <Rig> One of the more armored operatives jumps down behind Buffalo and scoops up Shui. A thin cord attached to his belt tightens and draws him and Shui back up into the darkness of the warehouse roof.
[21-Dec-2014 23:46:15]  <IllFlower> Oh, well, whatever.
[21-Dec-2014 23:46:25]  <Rig> IllFlower: Yeah, it's an SMG, right?
[21-Dec-2014 23:46:32]  <IllFlower> Antoine should totally toxwave the rope.
[21-Dec-2014 23:46:45]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yeah, I suppose. Oh, well, at least it's drawn.
[21-Dec-2014 23:47:32]  <Rig> The second armored operative moves around to the fallen Triad guard and fires into his chest.
[21-Dec-2014 23:48:51]  <Rig> The remaining police take shots at the fleeing Malcom and Koishi.
[21-Dec-2014 23:49:28]  <Rig> Let's group these rolls a bit.
[21-Dec-2014 23:49:30]  <Rig> Hang on.
[21-Dec-2014 23:49:33]  <BGTB2005> roll to dodge?
[21-Dec-2014 23:50:18]  <Rig> Yeah. So reaction.
[21-Dec-2014 23:50:28]  <jseblan> Antoine's turn will come up and he'll just stand there with everyone dead
[21-Dec-2014 23:50:33]  <Rig> Hahaha.

[21-Dec-2014 23:51:04]  <Rig> "This shit never happens in Montreal."
[21-Dec-2014 23:51:38]  <Rig> BGTB2005 & IllFlower: Could I get two reaction rolls from each of you?
[21-Dec-2014 23:51:54]  <IllFlower> I think we get +4 modifiers in cover as well.
[21-Dec-2014 23:52:07]  <BGTB2005> I have points in the dodge skill, unless you just want reaction
[21-Dec-2014 23:52:19]  <Rig> I took the penalty from the attackers, IllFlower.
[21-Dec-2014 23:52:27]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: You have to use Full Defense to do that.
[21-Dec-2014 23:52:32]  <Rig> BGTB2005: Just reaction. Full defense is required.
[21-Dec-2014 23:52:33]  <BGTB2005> ah

[21-Dec-2014 23:53:22]  <Rig> Yeah, the attackers have a penalty for the target being in cover.
[21-Dec-2014 23:53:37]  <BGTB2005> yeah I momentarily forgot
[21-Dec-2014 23:53:55]  <IllFlower> Apparently the defenders get a bonus as well.

[21-Dec-2014 23:55:01]  <Rig> Of course the GM sheet would list it differently.

[22-Dec-2014 00:01:37]  <jseblan> hmm
[22-Dec-2014 00:02:04]  <IllFlower> I'm hoping Antoine can do something about Shui's escort.
[22-Dec-2014 00:02:25]  <jseblan> if I can't see him I can't do much
[22-Dec-2014 00:04:32]  <jseblan> I use my power focus to cast Toxic Wave
[22-Dec-2014 00:04:58]  <Rig> Where are you wanting to cast it?
[22-Dec-2014 00:05:12]  <jseblan> Buffalo and the area surrounding him
[22-Dec-2014 00:05:36]  <Rig> Magic + Spellcasting + Focus
[22-Dec-2014 00:06:44]  <jseblan> @dice roll 13d6
[22-Dec-2014 00:06:44]  <Omnipresence> 14jseblan: Rolled 2 2 2 3 4 4 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 = 56.
[22-Dec-2014 00:06:48]  <jseblan> muahahaha
[22-Dec-2014 00:06:57]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[22-Dec-2014 00:07:10]  <Rig> One moment while I remember where the hell the Toxic Wave spell was.
[22-Dec-2014 00:07:27]  <IllFlower> Jesus.
[22-Dec-2014 00:08:50]  <Rig> Shit.
[22-Dec-2014 00:08:54]  <Rig> 14 damage. Hang on.
[22-Dec-2014 00:09:42]  <BGTB|Mobile> Wow
[22-Dec-2014 00:09:59]  <Haruspex> 14buffalo spontaneously dies of acid reflux
[22-Dec-2014 00:10:10]  <Rig> Kinda, yeah.
[22-Dec-2014 00:10:13]  <Rig> ....
[22-Dec-2014 00:10:27]  <Rig> That's a lot of damage to do at once. And acid damage is mean.
[22-Dec-2014 00:11:29]  <Rig> The wave of acid washes over the lights and Buffalo. There is the sound of metal rending and collapsing and startled screams as the guards fall down into the wave.
[22-Dec-2014 00:12:30]  <Rig> @dice roll 9d6
[22-Dec-2014 00:12:30]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Rolled 1 2 3 3 3 4 6 6 6 = 34.
[22-Dec-2014 00:12:33]  * jseblan cackles maniacally
[22-Dec-2014 00:14:01]  <Rig> The hissing and bubbling continues in the darkness for a moment before fading.
[22-Dec-2014 00:14:19]  <IllFlower> So, uh, who's still alive?
[22-Dec-2014 00:14:23]  <Rig> Um.
[22-Dec-2014 00:14:26]  <Rig> Buffalo is.
[22-Dec-2014 00:14:31]  <Rig> Just Buffalo.
[22-Dec-2014 00:14:39]  <Haruspex> 14rip shui
[22-Dec-2014 00:14:47]  <jseblan> didn't she already leave?
[22-Dec-2014 00:14:50]  <Rig> He's also the only person here who can see in the dark, IIRC.
[22-Dec-2014 00:15:03]  <Haruspex> 14yeah i just like saying "rip"
[22-Dec-2014 00:15:09]  <jseblan> my survival knife has a lighter, can I use it?
[22-Dec-2014 00:15:17]  <Haruspex> 14also maybe the ripped metal noises mean the roof falling in, again, what do i know
[22-Dec-2014 00:15:19]  <IllFlower> Well, shit, I was going to throw suppressive fire in the Wuxing folks' general direction, but it looks like that's no longer necessary.
[22-Dec-2014 00:15:23]  <Rig> She escaped unless you follow her to the extraction on the roof.
[22-Dec-2014 00:15:23]  <Rig> But holy shit.
[22-Dec-2014 00:15:23]  <Rig> Also, you need to roll for drain.
[22-Dec-2014 00:15:44]  <Haruspex> 14everybody still alive just stares at antoine, cowering
[22-Dec-2014 00:15:48]  <jseblan> @dice roll 9d6
[22-Dec-2014 00:15:48]  <Omnipresence> 14jseblan: Rolled 1 1 3 3 3 4 5 5 5 = 30.
[22-Dec-2014 00:17:06]  <Rig> You take 4 stun damage from drain.
[22-Dec-2014 00:17:06]  <Rig> Holy shit though. This was supposed to be at least a little hard.
[22-Dec-2014 00:17:06]  <Rig> You were supposed to maybe die.
[22-Dec-2014 00:17:06]  <Rig> ;-;
[22-Dec-2014 00:17:26]  <Rig> Anyway, um, I guess Antoine saved the best for last. Koishi and Buffalo both have another pass.
[22-Dec-2014 00:17:34]  <IllFlower> lolololol
[22-Dec-2014 00:17:36]  <Rig> BGTB2005: Do you want to do something?
[22-Dec-2014 00:18:35]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking Koishi should go up to the roof to see if she can't intercept Shui.
[22-Dec-2014 00:18:53]  <IllFlower> If this round was any indication, Antoine and Malcolm should be able to handle Buffalo.
[22-Dec-2014 00:18:57]  <IllFlower> Mostly Antoine.
[22-Dec-2014 00:19:00]  <Rig> Honestly, this was supposed to be the climatic battle. ¬.¬
[22-Dec-2014 00:19:04]  <BGTB|Mobile> Yeah, that sounds good
[22-Dec-2014 00:19:12]  <Haruspex> luck happens, rig.
[22-Dec-2014 00:19:20]  <Rig> I know, but just... Antoine is never lucky!
[22-Dec-2014 00:19:45]  <IllFlower> There's still time to make Buffalo the super-boss guy with disposable minions!
[22-Dec-2014 00:20:10]  <Rig> True, but I'd have to rejigger his stats and make him far more monstrous than what I originally intended.
[22-Dec-2014 00:20:51]  <Rig> Oh... maybe I'm wrong. I forgot the troll armor bonus. Lemme make sure I recorded this damage right.
[22-Dec-2014 00:21:02]  <IllFlower> The best-laid plans of mice and men gang aft agley.
[22-Dec-2014 00:21:36]  <Rig> Okay, he's not quite as injured as I thought. So, he's still somewhat of a threat. Especially in the dark.
[22-Dec-2014 00:23:29]  <Rig> BGTB2005: What's your plan?
[22-Dec-2014 00:23:48]  <Rig> BGTB|Mobile: I guess I should address you instead.
[22-Dec-2014 00:23:48]  <IllFlower> Gotta check out for a bit. I'll be back as soon as I can.
[22-Dec-2014 00:24:16]  <Rig> IllFlower: Okay.
[22-Dec-2014 00:26:43]  <BGTB|Mobile> Rig: heading up after Shui, I guess
[22-Dec-2014 00:26:54]  <Rig> How do you want to do that?
[22-Dec-2014 00:27:42]  <BGTB|Mobile> Take the stairs?
[22-Dec-2014 00:28:58]  <Rig> Hahaha, okay. You'll have to navigate the maze in the dark, find the stairs, and climb them.
[22-Dec-2014 00:31:33]  <jseblan> would Escape Artist work for that or is it just against bindings?
[22-Dec-2014 00:31:52]  <Rig> Just bindings.
[22-Dec-2014 00:31:59]  <BGTB|Mobile> Think it's just restraints
[22-Dec-2014 00:37:38]  *** Lin_Chong <~Lin_Chong@182.55.189.100> has joined #madokamadness
[22-Dec-2014 00:39:47]  <Rig> Would anyone object to wrapping this up for now?
[22-Dec-2014 00:40:33]  <Rig> I know it's been a short session today, but I'd like to make dinner and I dunno how long IllFlower is going to be.
[22-Dec-2014 00:42:17]  <jseblan> I don't mind
[22-Dec-2014 00:42:40]  <Rig> Sorry that it was kinda a rough session.
[22-Dec-2014 00:42:40]  <Rig> Hope it was fun.
[22-Dec-2014 00:42:54]  <BGTB|Mobile> Stopping here's good
[22-Dec-2014 00:42:56]  <jseblan> I enjoyed melting everything off
[22-Dec-2014 00:43:13]  *** BGTB|Mobile <~BGT@pool-100-3-205-37.tampfl.fios.verizon.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Bye)
[22-Dec-2014 00:43:16]  <Rig> I swear we'll finish out this story on our next session and then move to a system where we roll dice way less.
