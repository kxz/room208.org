@time=2014-12-22T00:26:54.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How do you want to do that?
@time=2014-12-22T00:27:42.000Z :BGTB|Mobile PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Take the stairs?
@time=2014-12-22T00:28:58.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha, okay. You'll have to navigate the maze in the dark, find the stairs, and climb them.
@time=2014-12-22T00:31:33.000Z :jseblan PRIVMSG #madokamadness :would Escape Artist work for that or is it just against bindings?
@time=2014-12-22T00:31:52.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just bindings.
@time=2014-12-22T00:31:59.000Z :BGTB|Mobile PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Think it's just restraints
