@time=2014-09-27T23:57:27.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: I could have added my Spellcasting foci to the dice pool, no?
@time=2014-09-27T23:57:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You could have, but it probably would have been overkill.
@time=2014-09-27T23:57:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She gets so hungry she decides to cannibalize her guard.
@time=2014-09-27T23:57:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :On the spot.
@time=2014-09-27T23:57:58.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :“Lead the way,” the guard says.
@time=2014-09-27T23:58:17.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :His attitude makes it clear he doesn’t intend to let her out of his sight.
@time=2014-09-27T23:58:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I figured this would happen.
@time=2014-09-27T23:58:46.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Koishi is still at the caterer's trailer, right?
@time=2014-09-27T23:58:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yep.
@time=2014-09-27T23:58:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I say we let her ambush the guard.
@time=2014-09-27T23:59:00.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2014-09-27T23:59:15.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :also having the guard might actually work in our favor
@time=2014-09-27T23:59:25.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :makes us look more legit while we get her to the trailer
@time=2014-09-27T23:59:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You are far less likely to get stopped, yes.
@time=2014-09-27T23:59:49.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Though you could also try suggesting the guard stay there (all magic like).
@time=2014-09-28T00:00:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Do you head back to the trailer with guard and girl in tow?
@time=2014-09-28T00:00:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I think that's for the best.
@time=2014-09-28T00:00:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Someone else would probably notice the guardless girl with a stranger.
@time=2014-09-28T00:00:30.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :oh, I know
@time=2014-09-28T00:00:46.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: I could cast a second Influence once she's at the trailer to make him want to check up on the other girls?
@time=2014-09-28T00:01:11.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Malcolm could reassure him he'll bring her back when she's done eating
@time=2014-09-28T00:01:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So dark nineties techno is pretty much the perfect backdrop for this.
@time=2014-09-28T00:02:01.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I say you should surprise him inside the trailer.
@time=2014-09-28T00:02:28.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But you could try to influence him before he enters the trailer, but then you’re casting in the open-ish.
@time=2014-09-28T00:02:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I kinda agree. Trying to cast another spell seems both complicated and visible.

@time=2014-09-28T00:02:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Did Koishi drag the bodies someplace out of sight?
@time=2014-09-28T00:02:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Plus we can end this session with some brief combat.
@time=2014-09-28T00:03:02.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :wait, it's a trailer, is it attached to any vehicles?
@time=2014-09-28T00:03:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I assume not.
@time=2014-09-28T00:03:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not at the moment.

@time=2014-09-28T00:03:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :They'll probably hitch it back up when the show's over.
@time=2014-09-28T00:03:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :God though. I would love it if you’d crash the pickup into the place to steal the entire trailer.

@time=2014-09-28T00:04:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, shall we say that you’ve arrived at the trailer.
@time=2014-09-28T00:04:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What would you like to do?
@time=2014-09-28T00:04:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We’ll assume the bodies are mostly out of sight, but a trailer is only so big.
@time=2014-09-28T00:04:56.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :they are artfully hidden as hors-d'oeuvre
@time=2014-09-28T00:05:02.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Gross.
@time=2014-09-28T00:06:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ewwwww.

@time=2014-09-28T00:06:56.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :we get in the trailer, close the door, let Koishi do her thing
@time=2014-09-28T00:07:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I say Koishi should just be lying in wait by the door.
@time=2014-09-28T00:07:07.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, plan? Malcolm goes in first and invites the girl and guard in after him. Antoine comes in last and beans the guy with a shock glove?
@time=2014-09-28T00:07:17.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :oh yeah!
@time=2014-09-28T00:08:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That'd work too.
@time=2014-09-28T00:08:04.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think I have three initiative passes in combat, so Koishi could probably use SnS ammo to subdue the girl and guard
@time=2014-09-28T00:08:43.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'll take care of the girl
@time=2014-09-28T00:08:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Malcolm would be dead weight, probably, so he'll be polite, just say "you go first," and then let the violence happen inside while he waits outside.
@time=2014-09-28T00:08:53.000Z :jseblan|shadowrunner PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I only have 2 agility so I'm more likely to succeed on her
@time=2014-09-28T00:09:15.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha. Okay, so, guard, girl and Antoine go inside while Malcolm hides outside acting nonchalant?
@time=2014-09-28T00:09:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Lights up a cigarette, maybe.
@time=2014-09-28T00:09:55.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, let’s get this under way since I need to go get dinner.
@time=2014-09-28T00:09:56.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Like a smoother version of Kazuki.
