[20-Dec-2015 00:07:12]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Novus Ordo Conservatorum
[20-Dec-2015 00:07:52]  <IllFlower> Okay, last time the Conservators talked to Minase and discovered that Noriko has a penchant for subtle revenge.
[20-Dec-2015 00:09:05]  <IllFlower> What's the plan now?
[20-Dec-2015 00:09:43]  <Calica> I think we now have to find a way to find out who did this
[20-Dec-2015 00:10:07]  <Rig> Yeah, I think we were going to talk to Akamine's girlfriends.
[20-Dec-2015 00:10:59]  <IllFlower> All right.
[20-Dec-2015 00:11:08]  <IllFlower> So I'll let you figure out how you want to approach them.
[20-Dec-2015 00:11:43]  <Rig> Hahaha, well, what kind of girls would hang out with a scary third year gang leader?
[20-Dec-2015 00:12:10]  <IllFlower> You really haven't watched Durarara, have you.
[20-Dec-2015 00:12:41]  <Rig> I probably should if this is gonna keep coming up.
[20-Dec-2015 00:13:08]  <IllFlower> Imagine, like... groupies.
[20-Dec-2015 00:13:31]  <Rig> Well, yes. 
[20-Dec-2015 00:13:45]  <Rig> How would our characters approach them. I feel like they'd be totally dismissive of Noriko.
[20-Dec-2015 00:13:57]  <Rig> She's too young establishment.
[20-Dec-2015 00:14:00]  <IllFlower> Fawning groupies that the groupie-ee doesn't really care for but prefers to have around rather than not.
[20-Dec-2015 00:15:11]  <IllFlower> You're probably right about the Noriko part.
[20-Dec-2015 00:15:20]  <IllFlower> Maybe they like Emiko a little more. I dunno.
[20-Dec-2015 00:15:28]  <BGTB2005> probably
[20-Dec-2015 00:15:42]  <Rig> Maybe they like the silent stoic power of Satori.
[20-Dec-2015 00:15:56]  <IllFlower> Nah, they think she's weird. A lot of people do.
[20-Dec-2015 00:16:08]  <Calica> perhaps Emiko should approach them, yeah.  She might even know one of them
[20-Dec-2015 00:16:29]  <Rig> Satori is like the homeschooled girl that comes to afterschool activities for socializing.
[20-Dec-2015 00:16:42]  <IllFlower> Hm, seems like Emiko has a lot of friends who are friends with gang members.
[20-Dec-2015 00:16:49]  <Calica> apparently
[20-Dec-2015 00:16:53]  <Rig> It seems like it is a theme at this school.
[20-Dec-2015 00:17:01]  <Rig> We're actually in Brick.
[20-Dec-2015 00:17:10]  <IllFlower> Hey, we haven't met Noriko's friends yet.
[20-Dec-2015 00:17:18]  <IllFlower> They're more upright, certainly.
[20-Dec-2015 00:17:26]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[20-Dec-2015 00:18:39]  <IllFlower> After school, it's hard to miss the small throng of girls hanging on to Akamine as he leaves the building. It would be kind of amusing if it weren't so disheartening.
[20-Dec-2015 00:19:35]  <IllFlower> Noriko clicks her tongue. The sight seems to have validated a thought in her mind about most people her age, and it's not a nice one.
[20-Dec-2015 00:22:04]  <Rig> However, Noriko's player only sees Akamine as Pigpen but with girls instead of dirt effects.
[20-Dec-2015 00:22:07]  <IllFlower> "I recognize one of them," Emiko says, squinting to get a better view. "The one with the long brown hair? That's Inamura. She's in our class."
[20-Dec-2015 00:22:26]  <IllFlower> Rig: girl particle effects
[20-Dec-2015 00:22:41]  <Rig> The next big thing in graphics.
[20-Dec-2015 00:22:43]  <Calica> ("I recognize one of these particle effects!  That mud's from our class.")
[20-Dec-2015 00:22:44]  <IllFlower> femnions
[20-Dec-2015 00:25:42]  <Rig> "Inamura?" Noriko couldn't remember her. She must have sat in the back of the class with the other troublemakers. 
[20-Dec-2015 00:26:15]  <IllFlower> There's clearly a pecking order. Inamura's kind of out on the fringes. Must be because she's only a first-year and hasn't had enough time to ingratiate herself to Akamine -- or assert her status over the others.
[20-Dec-2015 00:27:08]  <Rig> Would she even be useful to talk to?
[20-Dec-2015 00:27:37]  <Calica> we could maybe figure out which girls could even do the exploding letter trick
[20-Dec-2015 00:27:44]  <Rig> True.
[20-Dec-2015 00:28:49]  <Rig> So, how do we peel her off from the pack?
[20-Dec-2015 00:28:51]  *** Sheev <uid117340@id-117340.brockwell.irccloud.com> has quit IRC (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[20-Dec-2015 00:29:13]  <Calica> satori comes up and punches her (don't actually do this)
[20-Dec-2015 00:29:33]  <BGTB2005> Rin might do that
[20-Dec-2015 00:29:36]  <BGTB2005> Satori won't
[20-Dec-2015 00:31:03]  <IllFlower> Emiko clearly needs to use her smiling superpowers.
[20-Dec-2015 00:31:30]  <Calica> walk up and ask her for something, maybe?  but what
[20-Dec-2015 00:31:38]  <BGTB2005> maybe talk over tea and cookies
[20-Dec-2015 00:32:18]  <IllFlower> It should be fine to just try and peel her away first. Then you can figure out what to say afterward.
[20-Dec-2015 00:32:25]  <IllFlower> Maybe some improvisation is in order.
[20-Dec-2015 00:32:49]  <IllFlower> I'm perfectly happy to do some conflictin'.
[20-Dec-2015 00:33:09]  <Calica> I could go for a conflict as well, though I don't know about the rest of us
[20-Dec-2015 00:33:40]  <Rig> It sounds good. Not sure how much Noriko could play in this conflict.
[20-Dec-2015 00:34:17]  <IllFlower> Noriko could make shit up about student council business.
[20-Dec-2015 00:34:36]  <Rig> That is true.
[20-Dec-2015 00:35:10]  <Rig> What would the stakes of this conflict be? Is this just the conflict to pull her away from the group?
[20-Dec-2015 00:35:48]  <IllFlower> I don't see why not. If you want something else you can always make that a follow-up.
[20-Dec-2015 00:35:56]  <Rig> Sounds good to me.
[20-Dec-2015 00:36:12]  <Calica> good to me too
[20-Dec-2015 00:37:30]  <IllFlower> So who's going to do the peeling?
[20-Dec-2015 00:37:58]  <Rig> I'd be up for Noriko taking it.
[20-Dec-2015 00:38:15]  <Calica> Works for me too.
[20-Dec-2015 00:38:48]  <IllFlower> Cool. Let me make up some numbers.
[20-Dec-2015 00:38:54]  <Rig> 7?
[20-Dec-2015 00:39:01]  <Rig> Or do we mean imaginary numbers?

[20-Dec-2015 00:41:26]  <Rig> This looks just a little one-sided.
[20-Dec-2015 00:41:31]  <IllFlower> Hm, seems Inamura's a bit of a conversational pushover.
[20-Dec-2015 00:41:49]  <Rig> Shall I raise?
[20-Dec-2015 00:42:04]  <IllFlower> Sounds like the right thing to do.
[20-Dec-2015 00:43:16]  <Rig> "Inamura!" Noriko calls out, striding as confidently as she can toward Akamine's gaggle of groupies. "Inamura, I need to speak to you."

[20-Dec-2015 00:44:52]  <IllFlower> Inamura, halfway in the middle of either flirting with Akamine or just trying to be noticed, turns around and looks at Noriko. She then turns around and looks right back at the rest of her group.

[20-Dec-2015 00:46:18]  <IllFlower> Akamine turns and pauses, locking eyes with Noriko.

[20-Dec-2015 00:48:46]  <Rig> Noriko doesn't look away from Akamine. She does have some authority in this school, even if the delinquents think they're above it.
[20-Dec-2015 00:49:06]  <Rig> Ugh, that's a little weak.
[20-Dec-2015 00:49:08]  <Calica> do you mean Inamura too?
[20-Dec-2015 00:49:26]  <Calica> if you want to be aggressive, you could say that :p

[20-Dec-2015 00:55:10]  <IllFlower> Sure.
[20-Dec-2015 00:57:47]  <Rig> Akamine recognizes Noriko as having some relation to the student council, not that he remembered how. The first-year girl had a penchant for being a little flamboyant in her outfits.  Akamine spares a glance back at Inamura before shrugging and turning back to the older girls.

[20-Dec-2015 01:01:33]  <Rig> Escalating to physical would be... amusing.
[20-Dec-2015 01:02:36]  <IllFlower> That girl... she's on the student council, isn't she? Inamura sighs. That looks like work. She doesn't like work.
[20-Dec-2015 01:03:23]  <IllFlower> She suddenly shouts Akamine's name, trying to get his attention back so that if Noriko gets more insistent, she can use him as defense.
[20-Dec-2015 01:03:55]  <IllFlower> Going to assign 2d8 to "will do anything to avoid extra work."

[20-Dec-2015 01:05:27]  <IllFlower> Unfortunately for Inamura, one of the other girls cuts in before she can get another word in edgewise. Dispirited, she starts to slowly fall away from the group.
[20-Dec-2015 01:05:45]  <IllFlower> Noriko runs up to catch her.

[20-Dec-2015 01:10:04]  <Calica> Should Emiko and Satori come up behind Noriko?
[20-Dec-2015 01:10:26]  <IllFlower> Up to you.
[20-Dec-2015 01:11:01]  <Rig> Shit, I've forgotten why we wanted to talk to her.
[20-Dec-2015 01:11:36]  <IllFlower> To get juicy deets on Akamine's girls, because Minase suspects one of them sent Mayumi the flaming letter.
[20-Dec-2015 01:12:09]  <IllFlower> That's the technical term. Juicy deets.
[20-Dec-2015 01:12:14]  <Rig> Right. Hm, so, should we start another conflict?
[20-Dec-2015 01:12:34]  <IllFlower> You haven't even actually said anything to her yet!
[20-Dec-2015 01:12:45]  <Calica> Emiko comes up behind Noriko.
[20-Dec-2015 01:16:21]  <IllFlower> And stabs her?
[20-Dec-2015 01:16:29]  <IllFlower> What a twist!
[20-Dec-2015 01:16:35]  <Calica> nah, just as support in the coming followup
[20-Dec-2015 01:16:51]  <Rig> "Inamura, do you know Mayumi?"
[20-Dec-2015 01:17:15]  <IllFlower> That's, uh, direct.
[20-Dec-2015 01:17:30]  <Calica> rather
[20-Dec-2015 01:17:42]  <Rig> Sorry, I spent like 10 minutes trying to come up with something.
[20-Dec-2015 01:18:17]  <IllFlower> Nah, we'll go with it.
[20-Dec-2015 01:18:57]  <IllFlower> Satori fires Noriko a bewildered glare. Way to be obvious.
[20-Dec-2015 01:19:10]  <Rig> No one said Noriko was subtle.
[20-Dec-2015 01:20:03]  <IllFlower> Inamura doesn't seem to notice, though. She's too busy just trying to sort through what's happening. "Mayumi... Rokujou?"
[20-Dec-2015 01:21:26]  <IllFlower> She nods. "I've heard her name, I guess. The girls talk about her sometimes."
[20-Dec-2015 01:21:38]  <Calica> "They do?  What do they say?"
[20-Dec-2015 01:21:43]  <IllFlower> Her demeanor seems to suggest that she doesn't quite know about what happened to Mayumi that morning.
[20-Dec-2015 01:21:55]  <Rig> Emiko takes the words right out of Noriko's mouth.
[20-Dec-2015 01:22:53]  <IllFlower> "I -- I guess?" She answers a yes-no question that wasn't asked.
[20-Dec-2015 01:23:33]  <IllFlower> "Suzuhara doesn't like her very much. I think the rest of us just kind of follow along..."
[20-Dec-2015 01:24:19]  <IllFlower> Remarkably talkative for someone the girls barely know. Maybe she thinks she's in trouble.
[20-Dec-2015 01:24:30]  <IllFlower> Then again, maybe she *is* in trouble.
[20-Dec-2015 01:24:55]  <Calica> "Suzuhara?  I'm not really familiar with this name..." (unless she is in which case replace this line)
[20-Dec-2015 01:25:26]  <IllFlower> "Rei Suzuhara. She's like...
[20-Dec-2015 01:26:27]  <IllFlower> "I don't know. Her relationship with Akamine is different from the rest of ours. It's... it's hard to explain."
[20-Dec-2015 01:27:33]  <Calica> "I'm curious, so could you try to explain?"
[20-Dec-2015 01:28:26]  <IllFlower> ("A GIRLFRIEND")
[20-Dec-2015 01:29:41]  <IllFlower> "Akamine treats her like one of the guys. She's the only one of us who's gotten him to back down from something.
[20-Dec-2015 01:30:51]  <IllFlower> "It's not because he likes her. I don't think Akamine's --" Inamura stops short and changes tack. "It's like part of him respects her. Or is afraid of her."
[20-Dec-2015 01:31:10]  <IllFlower> Like any good criminal syndicate, Noriko thinks.
[20-Dec-2015 01:31:47]  <Calica> brb dinner (i'm going to bring it up)
[20-Dec-2015 01:36:37]  <IllFlower> I'm flattered that we're that important.
[20-Dec-2015 01:37:00]  <Calica> back
[20-Dec-2015 01:37:14]  <Rig> "What did she make him back down from?"
[20-Dec-2015 01:40:44]  <IllFlower> "He wanted to bring a group and beat someone up.
[20-Dec-2015 01:41:47]  <IllFlower> "And she convinced him not to, that she could handle the situation in... I think she said, 'a more insidious way.'
[20-Dec-2015 01:41:56]  <IllFlower> "It was just a couple of days ago."
[20-Dec-2015 01:43:15]  <Rig> Noriko makes a concerned face.
[20-Dec-2015 01:43:25]  <BGTB2005> "Who did he want to beat up?"
[20-Dec-2015 01:44:35]  <Rig> She's certainly really forthcoming.
[20-Dec-2015 01:44:48]  <Calica> she thinks we're gonna beat her up, i think
[20-Dec-2015 01:45:10]  <IllFlower> "A second-year. Mi... I don't remember. Mitani? No, that wasn't it..."
[20-Dec-2015 01:45:37]  <IllFlower> Inamura is shaking a bit. "I'm not in trouble, am I?"
[20-Dec-2015 01:46:04]  <Rig> ("Not if you snitch."
[20-Dec-2015 01:46:05]  <Rig> )
[20-Dec-2015 01:46:22]  <IllFlower> ("Well, not with us, at least. Maybe Akamine...")
[20-Dec-2015 01:49:15]  <Rig> Hm, do we tell her about what happened to Mayumi?
[20-Dec-2015 01:52:05]  <IllFlower> It's not like it's a secret, so really this is just about Inamura's reaction.
[20-Dec-2015 01:52:14]  <IllFlower> s/this is/this would be/
[20-Dec-2015 01:53:31]  <Rig> "You're not in trouble. We just wanted to ask if you knew anything about who would have put an exploding letter in Mayumi's locker."
[20-Dec-2015 01:55:40]  <IllFlower> "A... a what?" So she in fact didn't know.
[20-Dec-2015 01:55:58]  <Rig> Yeah, not surprising.
[20-Dec-2015 01:56:41]  <IllFlower> "Minase!" Inamura suddenly blurts out.
[20-Dec-2015 01:56:55]  <IllFlower> "That was his name."
[20-Dec-2015 01:57:19]  <IllFlower> Stick to one conversational track, girl, Noriko thinks.
[20-Dec-2015 01:57:35]  <Rig> Totally.
[20-Dec-2015 01:58:34]  <Rig> "Minase? Akamine was going to beat up Minase?"
[20-Dec-2015 01:59:47]  <IllFlower> "Yeah. As payback for what happened to that boy in our class."
[20-Dec-2015 02:00:35]  <Calica> "Ueno?"
[20-Dec-2015 02:01:37]  <IllFlower> Inamura nods.
[20-Dec-2015 02:03:07]  <IllFlower> I'd say more but I think that'd just make everything blatantly obvious.
[20-Dec-2015 02:04:20]  <Rig> Probably.
[20-Dec-2015 02:04:48]  <IllFlower> Hey, I'm trying to be more true to the spirit of Dogs. Which is spilling everything right up to the brink of beating a dead horse.
[20-Dec-2015 02:05:25]  <Rig> Well, I think we have a pretty good idea of who the ring leader is.
[20-Dec-2015 02:06:12]  <Rig> How do we want to address that? Should we talk Inamura out of being a groupie?
[20-Dec-2015 02:07:26]  <BGTB2005> I guess?
[20-Dec-2015 02:08:46]  <Calica> ("Maybe you shouldn't have a crush on a dangerous gangster?")
[20-Dec-2015 02:09:14]  <IllFlower> #truth
[20-Dec-2015 02:10:48]  <Rig> I mean, it's our responsibility to keep the peace, right?
[20-Dec-2015 02:10:58]  <Rig> And not having crushes on mini-gangsters is a good first step.
[20-Dec-2015 02:11:32]  <IllFlower> Well, if you see something, say something.
[20-Dec-2015 02:11:53]  <Rig> "Inamura, maybe you shouldn't hang out with Akamine and his group."
[20-Dec-2015 02:12:05]  <Calica> would this be conflict-worthy?
[20-Dec-2015 02:12:34]  <IllFlower> "What do you mean?"
[20-Dec-2015 02:13:23]  <Rig> "They seem a little dangerous, don't you think?" Noriko says. "I mean, normal people our age don't plan 'something insidious.'"
[20-Dec-2015 02:14:45]  <IllFlower> "I... I guess you have a point."
[20-Dec-2015 02:15:00]  <IllFlower> Inamura looks back over her shoulder. Akamine's group is long gone, of course.
[20-Dec-2015 02:16:25]  <IllFlower> "Just... don't let them know that I told you this."
[20-Dec-2015 02:16:55]  <Calica> "Of course.  It'll be between us."
[20-Dec-2015 02:16:57]  <Rig> "Of course," Noriko smiles at the girl. It isn't quite as winning as Emiko's but it's a genuine smile.
[20-Dec-2015 02:17:44]  <BGTB2005> Satori nods
[20-Dec-2015 02:18:34]  <IllFlower> "Um, best of luck with your student council business."
[20-Dec-2015 02:18:51]  <IllFlower> She gives a shallow bow and hurries off.
[20-Dec-2015 02:19:37]  <Rig> That went well.
[20-Dec-2015 02:19:54]  <Rig> No died or shouted or exploded.
[20-Dec-2015 02:20:12]  <IllFlower> Well, now what?
[20-Dec-2015 02:20:38]  <BGTB2005> Try investigating Suzuhara?
[20-Dec-2015 02:21:21]  <Rig> Well, she does seem to be the ringleader.
[20-Dec-2015 02:21:29]  <Calica> I think that's basically the next step, yes
[20-Dec-2015 02:21:57]  <Rig> We could also try to continue dismantling her power structure.
[20-Dec-2015 02:25:00]  <IllFlower> You talk about her like she's a bureaucracy.
[20-Dec-2015 02:25:17]  <Calica> next 3 episodes: we track down a girl, convince her to stop hanging out around Akamine
[20-Dec-2015 02:26:20]  <IllFlower> Sounds exciting.
[20-Dec-2015 02:26:22]  <Rig> That sounds like how most open world games work.
[20-Dec-2015 02:26:36]  <Rig> Climb a tower, liberate a district, then take down the big bad.
[20-Dec-2015 02:27:13]  <Rig> But yeah, investigating her and figuring out how to get her to fess up to someone who can expel her sounds good.
[20-Dec-2015 02:27:18]  <BGTB2005> Toppling Suzuhara sounds More Fun and like There Can't Possibly Be Any Consequences To Doing So In Later Arcs
[20-Dec-2015 02:27:23]  <Calica> ^
[20-Dec-2015 02:28:05]  <IllFlower> All right, let's do all that, then.
[20-Dec-2015 02:30:34]  <IllFlower> The nice thing about schools is that they have class rosters. Rei Suzuhara is in 2-C, according to Kumagawa High's. Her classmates, true to Inamura's account, seem to see her around Akamine a lot.
[20-Dec-2015 02:31:43]  <IllFlower> This attracts some attention, because she's also got some of the highest grades in her year, and none of these, uh, fight clubs, let's call them, have a reputation for attracting the best and the brightest. Especially girls.
[20-Dec-2015 02:32:17]  <IllFlower> Seems to fit the "insidious" profile to a T, though.
[20-Dec-2015 02:33:06]  <Rig> She seems to be possessed by ghosts?
[20-Dec-2015 02:33:14]  <Rig> Actually, that would be kinda what we're looking for.
[20-Dec-2015 02:33:21]  <IllFlower> She's not in any clubs, and often walks home alone after classes.
[20-Dec-2015 02:33:33]  *** Haruspex <~Glossina@67-5-197-203.ptld.qwest.net> has joined #madokamadness
[20-Dec-2015 02:35:10]  <IllFlower> All in all, there's a fair bit of mystique about her, and a slight aura of untouchableness. The teachers aren't going to be bothered with her as long as she keeps her studies chugging along, after all.
[20-Dec-2015 02:37:52]  <Rig> What should our plan be?
[20-Dec-2015 02:40:47]  <Calica> maybe try to get her talking about mayumi until she lets something incriminating slip?  cellphones have a voice recording feature now, right?
[20-Dec-2015 02:41:25]  <Rig> That sounds reasonable.
[20-Dec-2015 02:41:39]  <Rig> Just like, ambush her on her walk home?
[20-Dec-2015 02:41:46]  <Calica> if it worked once
[20-Dec-2015 02:41:53]  <Rig> Be like "Hey friend, let's talk about Mayumi."
[20-Dec-2015 02:43:22]  <IllFlower> lol
[20-Dec-2015 02:44:43]  <IllFlower> Well, if you're going to do it, do it.
[20-Dec-2015 02:45:08]  <Rig> Anyone want to set the scene then?
[20-Dec-2015 02:47:41]  <Calica> do we want to skip to the next day as the bells ring?
[20-Dec-2015 02:47:53]  <IllFlower> BING BONG BING BONG
[20-Dec-2015 02:48:04]  <Calica> i.e. the bells letting classes out
[20-Dec-2015 02:48:11]  <IllFlower> BING BONG BING BONG
[20-Dec-2015 02:48:38]  <Calica> As classes let out for the day, the girls wait near class 2-C for one girl in particular to exit.
[20-Dec-2015 02:50:21]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara looks a world away from the girls that were swarming Akamine yesterday. She barely acknowledges anyone else's existence as she packs up to head home.
[20-Dec-2015 02:52:21]  <Rig> Noriko cannot help but feel a little twinge of similarity with this girl. She seems so different from Akamine's other associates.
[20-Dec-2015 02:52:29]  <Calica> pffff of course
[20-Dec-2015 02:52:31]  <IllFlower> Her long dark hair and her deep brown eyes give her the feel of a crow's wings. Who knows what she's thinking.
[20-Dec-2015 02:54:17]  <Calica> Emiko, on the other hand, feels a little unsettled.  This is the girl who probably gave Mayumi a bomb disguised as a letter.
[20-Dec-2015 02:54:27]  <Calica> (also: crow?  fire?  i see rin's found a new home)
[20-Dec-2015 02:55:39]  <IllFlower> It takes Noriko two or three tries calling Suzuhara's name before she gets any response, but Suzuhara betrays no surprise when she does turn to address the Conservators. This girl is working from her own script.
[20-Dec-2015 02:56:14]  <IllFlower> "Yes?" she says. Her expression is disturbingly placid.
[20-Dec-2015 02:56:27]  <Rig> Do we keep with our decidely unsubtle approach?
[20-Dec-2015 02:56:48]  <BGTB2005> sure
[20-Dec-2015 02:56:49]  <Calica> it seems IllFlower has decided this
[20-Dec-2015 02:57:00]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[20-Dec-2015 02:57:21]  <IllFlower> I mean, if you want to go back on it, you can.
[20-Dec-2015 02:57:33]  <BGTB2005> Have any of our characters ever been any good at subtlety?
[20-Dec-2015 02:57:42]  <Rig> I mean, there have been... no.
[20-Dec-2015 02:57:44]  <Rig> Not at all.
[20-Dec-2015 02:58:07]  <Calica> um, maybe there was someone in emburst?  no wait, no
[20-Dec-2015 02:58:54]  <Rig> Mayumi wasn't seriously hurt right? Would she have been at school this day?
[20-Dec-2015 02:59:46]  <IllFlower> Mayumi's gone for a second day. Her mother's told Emiko that even though she's not physically injured, she doesn't feel comfortable going back. Might also have to do with the fact that today's the last day of the week, though.
[20-Dec-2015 03:00:07]  <IllFlower> Just a little. Not to cast aspersions on Mayumi.
[20-Dec-2015 03:00:40]  <IllFlower> You know, because even though she's fictional, she deserves a little bit of courtesy from me.
[20-Dec-2015 03:00:48]  <BGTB2005> yeah if I had a letter explode in my face at school I probably would want to stay home too
[20-Dec-2015 03:00:53]  <Calica> is IllFlower saying that mayumi's a false flag
[20-Dec-2015 03:01:08]  <IllFlower> It was the Illuminati all along.
[20-Dec-2015 03:01:52]  <Rig> So, my idea is to basically say we're putting together some kind of get well card or something for Mayumi (to try to alleviate the trauma of receiving letters).
[20-Dec-2015 03:02:07]  <Calica> good idea
[20-Dec-2015 03:02:16]  <Rig> And say that someone told us Suzuhara knew her and might want to join in.
[20-Dec-2015 03:02:30]  <BGTB2005> ("We promise this one won't explode." :) )
[20-Dec-2015 03:03:13]  <Rig> I don't know if that makes much sense or is too definitely a lie to catch Suzuhara.
[20-Dec-2015 03:03:57]  <IllFlower> Well, previous levels of subtlety for this supercontinuity have been to run in, magical guns blazing, and shout denunciations all around.
[20-Dec-2015 03:04:13]  <Calica> I like it.
[20-Dec-2015 03:04:16]  <Rig> There have been previous attempts at subterfuge.
[20-Dec-2015 03:05:06]  <IllFlower> Attempts.
[20-Dec-2015 03:05:12]  <Rig> "Suzuhara, we were putting together a get well card for Mayumi. Someone told us you were close with her and we wanted to know if you'd like to sign it."
[20-Dec-2015 03:05:30]  <IllFlower> "Is that so?"
[20-Dec-2015 03:05:53]  <Rig> Noriko doesn't really know how to respond to a question to her question. She just sorta nods.
[20-Dec-2015 03:06:29]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara's rather tall, and the effect of her looking down at Noriko isn't a particularly pleasant one.
[20-Dec-2015 03:07:04]  <Calica> "Are you implying it's not so?"
[20-Dec-2015 03:07:27]  <IllFlower> "I'm afraid I don't know Rokujou all that well. Are you sure it'd be okay for me to sign it? I'd hate to be an intruder."
[20-Dec-2015 03:08:23]  <IllFlower> She says all these thoughtful words, but her tone of voice is that script again. Underinflected and hollow.
[20-Dec-2015 03:08:40]  <Rig> "Oh, I'm sorry to have bothered you. You did hear about what happened, didn't you?" (I would assume there would be some gossip about an exploding letter.)
[20-Dec-2015 03:09:52]  <IllFlower> "Yes, of course. An unfortunate thing to have happen to her, certainly."
[20-Dec-2015 03:10:06]  <Rig> Noriko isn't entirely convinced she means that.
[20-Dec-2015 03:10:16]  <Rig> Or convinced in the slightest.
[20-Dec-2015 03:11:24]  <IllFlower> Does she show it?
[20-Dec-2015 03:12:30]  <Rig> I suppose an observant person could see the doubt in her expression, but she tries to keep it to herself.
[20-Dec-2015 03:13:25]  <Rig> "I heard it was more of the ridiculous gang war that Akamine's been waging. It's ridiculous to drag such an innocent girl into that nonsense."
[20-Dec-2015 03:15:53]  <IllFlower> "Akamine's not so thoughtless. He knows that it's not worth his time or effort to drag outsiders into his affairs.
[20-Dec-2015 03:16:16]  <IllFlower> "If your hypothesis is correct, I suspect Rokujou may not be as innocent as you think."
[20-Dec-2015 03:17:19]  <Calica> "Regardless, it's pretty nasty, disguising a bomb as a love letter, don't you think?"
[20-Dec-2015 03:18:11]  <IllFlower> "He must have thought the situation necessitated such measures."
[20-Dec-2015 03:20:10]  <Rig> "You seem more sympathetic to him than to the girl he tried to burn."
[20-Dec-2015 03:21:39]  <IllFlower> "I'm simply giving you my understanding of events.
[20-Dec-2015 03:21:59]  <IllFlower> "It might seem harsh, but I'm only telling you what I see."
[20-Dec-2015 03:22:06]  <Rig> "Very pragmatic, I suppose."
[20-Dec-2015 03:22:16]  *** revertedtozero <~theirsbai@197.157.246.6> has joined #madokamadness
[20-Dec-2015 03:22:32]  <IllFlower> "I do try."
[20-Dec-2015 03:23:26]  <Rig> Anyone want to give it a shot at prying her evil secrets from her pragmatic soul?
[20-Dec-2015 03:23:56]  <BGTB2005> maybe invite her somewhere for tea and cookies?
[20-Dec-2015 03:24:11]  <revertedtozero> Who are we talking about?
[20-Dec-2015 03:24:13]  <Rig> Hahaha. "We're interested in your heartlessness? Want to get tea?"
[20-Dec-2015 03:24:31]  <Rig> revertedtozero: We're in the middle of a roleplaying game.
[20-Dec-2015 03:24:40]  <revertedtozero> Oh.
[20-Dec-2015 03:24:55]  <Calica> I sort of want to give prying secrets a shot but I'm not sure if I want another conflict this late
[20-Dec-2015 03:25:10]  <Rig> It might be an interesting conflict.
[20-Dec-2015 03:25:26]  <Calica> this late meaning this late in the physical day
[20-Dec-2015 03:25:33]  <Rig> Yeah, I understand.
[20-Dec-2015 03:25:43]  <Rig> I do have to be at the airport at like 4am.
[20-Dec-2015 03:25:54]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara places a hand on Noriko's shoulder.
[20-Dec-2015 03:26:04]  <IllFlower> "Can I offer you some advice?"
[20-Dec-2015 03:26:21]  <Calica> Rig: yikes, i hope you get some sleep on the plane
[20-Dec-2015 03:26:36]  <Rig> "I suppose," Noriko says. Expecting to get advice either way.
[20-Dec-2015 03:27:13]  <IllFlower> "If it is as you say, and Akamine is involved, I would keep my distance."
[20-Dec-2015 03:27:16]  <IllFlower> Crackle.
[20-Dec-2015 03:28:11]  <IllFlower> "He may not be prone to using force for force's sake, but when he has a motivation, he prefers to go all out."
[20-Dec-2015 03:28:11]  <Rig> Noriko looks up at the imposing girl and gets the feeling that this is both genuine advice and a threat.
[20-Dec-2015 03:28:18]  <IllFlower> Another crackle.
[20-Dec-2015 03:28:50]  <IllFlower> "Unless you're willing to stake yourself in Rokujou's place --"
[20-Dec-2015 03:29:17]  <Rig> She's discovered that Noriko is actually layered with wrapping paper and crinkles when touched.
[20-Dec-2015 03:29:32]  <BGTB2005> pffff
[20-Dec-2015 03:29:38]  <IllFlower> Noriko suddenly realizes that the crackling is coming from her own body. Her shoulder. The very shoulder Suzuhara has a hand on, in fact.
[20-Dec-2015 03:29:48]  <IllFlower> The skin there is hot. Very hot. Burning.
[20-Dec-2015 03:30:13]  <Rig> Noriko steps back, pushing away Suzuhara's hand.
[20-Dec-2015 03:30:20]  <IllFlower> "-- I'd recommend leaving it up to the proper --"
[20-Dec-2015 03:30:48]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara stops speaking, but otherwise doesn't react.
[20-Dec-2015 03:30:49]  <Calica> Emiko looks at Suzuhara's hand and Noriko's shoulder.
[20-Dec-2015 03:31:09]  <IllFlower> It's not supposed to be something Emiko could notice.
[20-Dec-2015 03:31:26]  <Calica> oh, nevermind then
[20-Dec-2015 03:31:34]  <IllFlower> Unless the school uniforms are sleeveless.
[20-Dec-2015 03:31:42]  <IllFlower> Or Noriko is topless.
[20-Dec-2015 03:31:44]  <Rig> "I'm sure the proper authorities will handle it," Noriko says.
[20-Dec-2015 03:31:44]  <IllFlower> Your call.
[20-Dec-2015 03:32:38]  <Rig> I mean, sleeveless would match her fashion trait, right?
[20-Dec-2015 03:32:44]  <Calica> I was thinking maybe it'd be visible on the clothes too but that might not be how her power works
[20-Dec-2015 03:32:50]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but they're the school's uniforms, not hers.
[20-Dec-2015 03:33:07]  <Rig> You don't buy your own uniform?
[20-Dec-2015 03:33:25]  <IllFlower> You don't get a lot of freedom to modify it, is what I'm saying.
[20-Dec-2015 03:33:31]  <Rig> True.
[20-Dec-2015 03:33:34]  <IllFlower> It's a uniform.
[20-Dec-2015 03:34:17]  <Rig> I'm not sure I want to confront Suzuhara outright here.
[20-Dec-2015 03:34:22]  <IllFlower> "That's good. It's for the best if you understand that."
[20-Dec-2015 03:34:49]  <IllFlower> There's always next session! ^_^
[20-Dec-2015 03:35:46]  <Rig> Haha, yes, well, I think we should back off and regroup for a different tactic. I don't want to jump straight to magic shooting.
[20-Dec-2015 03:36:23]  <BGTB2005> we could have a chase scene
[20-Dec-2015 03:36:27]  <BGTB2005> then the magical shooting
[20-Dec-2015 03:36:35]  <Rig> I do not think Suzuhara would run.
[20-Dec-2015 03:36:42]  <BGTB2005> *magic shooting, whatever
[20-Dec-2015 03:36:46]  <Rig> Unless you meant we should run?
[20-Dec-2015 03:37:25]  <IllFlower> In circles?
[20-Dec-2015 03:37:36]  <Calica> yeah, I'm not sure that magic shooting at this point is the best idea
[20-Dec-2015 03:37:42]  <Rig> It'd be keeping up with our usual behavior.
[20-Dec-2015 03:37:51]  <BGTB2005> we are still in a classroom, yes?
[20-Dec-2015 03:38:19]  <Calica> I thought we might be outside now?
[20-Dec-2015 03:38:24]  <Calica> but yeah, probably near the school
[20-Dec-2015 03:39:59]  <IllFlower> You're certainly somewhere.
[20-Dec-2015 03:40:20]  <Rig> A good guess.
[20-Dec-2015 03:42:03]  <Rig> I guess there isn't any reason we shouldn't try to stop her.
[20-Dec-2015 03:42:51]  <IllFlower> But right now?
[20-Dec-2015 03:43:17]  <IllFlower> I also mean "right now" as in the real world, because I haven't eaten dinner.
[20-Dec-2015 03:43:35]  <Rig> I mean right now in game time.
[20-Dec-2015 03:43:38]  <Rig> So next session.
[20-Dec-2015 03:43:49]  <Rig> Are we gonna call this session here and decide where to go at the start of the next one?
[20-Dec-2015 03:43:57]  <IllFlower> So you're not just going to let her walk off? Way to kidnap her.
[20-Dec-2015 03:44:08]  <IllFlower> Sure, let's do that. I've gotta get to cooking.
[20-Dec-2015 03:44:11]  <Rig> Was that ever a goal? Kidnapping her?
[20-Dec-2015 03:44:18]  * IllFlower whistles
[20-Dec-2015 03:44:19]  <BGTB2005> ...it could be?
[20-Dec-2015 03:44:19]  <Calica> IllFlower: Thanks for running these sessions.
[20-Dec-2015 03:44:29]  <Rig> Yeah, good session. Sorry we started so late.
[20-Dec-2015 03:44:31]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, folks. We'll be back in the new year.
[20-Dec-2015 03:44:40]  <Rig> Have a good holiday.
