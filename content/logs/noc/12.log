[13-Mar-2016 23:02:04]  <IllFlower> So last time we left off with Noriko getting in a spot of trouble.
[13-Mar-2016 23:02:33]  <Rig> A minor amount.
[13-Mar-2016 23:02:47]  <IllFlower> Just a tad.
[13-Mar-2016 23:02:59]  <IllFlower> She's been summoned to the staff room.
[13-Mar-2016 23:03:18]  <Rig> They have prepared the binding circle.
[13-Mar-2016 23:03:43]  <IllFlower> Let's not go there.
[13-Mar-2016 23:03:51]  <BGTB2005> :<
[13-Mar-2016 23:04:15]  <Rig> I meant the magical kind.
[13-Mar-2016 23:04:45]  <BGTB2005> here I was thinking Hikari would be involved somehow
[13-Mar-2016 23:04:53]  <Calica> besides, Hikari's not theyeah
[13-Mar-2016 23:04:54]  <IllFlower> Let's really not go there.
[13-Mar-2016 23:05:17]  <BGTB2005> :<
[13-Mar-2016 23:05:34]  <IllFlower> Mr. Tsukimoto sits down at his desk and pulls the knife out of Noriko's bag.
[13-Mar-2016 23:05:48]  <IllFlower> Noriko is glad there's not really anyone else here to pay attention.
[13-Mar-2016 23:06:33]  <IllFlower> "I assume there's an explanation for this?" the teacher says, not fully convinced he's going to like what he's about to hear.
[13-Mar-2016 23:07:14]  <Rig> Conflict for this?
[13-Mar-2016 23:07:23]  <IllFlower> Stakes?
[13-Mar-2016 23:08:04]  <Rig> Noriko convinces Mr. Tsukimoto that the knife is there by mistake.
[13-Mar-2016 23:08:17]  <IllFlower> Let's roll.
[13-Mar-2016 23:08:36]  <Rig> Do I carry over the 4 from the last conflict?
[13-Mar-2016 23:09:04]  <IllFlower> You gave on a see, not a raise, so no.
[13-Mar-2016 23:09:14]  <Rig> Ah, right.

[13-Mar-2016 23:10:03]  <Rig> Does the knife come into play here as a belonging?
[13-Mar-2016 23:10:13]  <IllFlower> Are you planning on stabbing Mr. Tsukimoto or something?
[13-Mar-2016 23:10:23]  <Rig> Not right now.
[13-Mar-2016 23:10:25]  <IllFlower> lol
[13-Mar-2016 23:10:41]  <IllFlower> I'll put Mr. Tsukimoto's question up as a raise.

[13-Mar-2016 23:14:03]  <Rig> Noriko tries her best to hide her internal panic. "I guess I was in a bit of rush packing my bag this morning. It was a little hectic at home." Noriko smiles and gives a shrug that she intends as "You know how it is."

[13-Mar-2016 23:14:30]  <Calica> a bit of a panic, accidentally grabbed a delinquent's knife
[13-Mar-2016 23:14:44]  <Rig> I've been assuming it is a kitchen knife.
[13-Mar-2016 23:14:51]  <Rig> Since I don't think we ever described it.
[13-Mar-2016 23:17:40]  <Rig> Mr. Tsukimoto doesn't look too convinced by her shrug, so Noriko continues, "I know you're supposed to be searching for weapons, but I'm hardly the delinquent type. I'm on the student council. This was just me being clumsy."

[13-Mar-2016 23:20:34]  <IllFlower> "There's a limit to clumsiness, Hisakawa. You really didn't notice this thing?" Mr. Tsukimoto lifts the knife to show that it's got some heft. Stainless steel isn't exactly light.

[13-Mar-2016 23:25:17]  <Calica> lots of d4s here, I wonder if Noriko's going to run out of the room crying-
[13-Mar-2016 23:26:19]  <Rig> So, question about motivation.
[13-Mar-2016 23:27:09]  <IllFlower> Motivation?
[13-Mar-2016 23:27:16]  <Rig> I was thinking Noriko could pressure Mr. Tsukimoto to ignore the knife to keep student council from looking bad, but I dunno if Noriko would go that far after her shady dealings went poorly last arc.
[13-Mar-2016 23:27:19]  <Rig> Thoughts?
[13-Mar-2016 23:27:50]  <IllFlower> There is the alternate strategy of falling on her sword and hoping that gets him to overlook it.
[13-Mar-2016 23:27:58]  <IllFlower> Or just telling him what happened...
[13-Mar-2016 23:28:05]  <Rig> Hahaha, honesty?
[13-Mar-2016 23:28:10]  <Rig> A novel approach.
[13-Mar-2016 23:28:30]  <Rig> Though I think that would be a give on my part again.
[13-Mar-2016 23:29:18]  <IllFlower> Given the stakes, yes. Though you can do an immediate follow-up.
[13-Mar-2016 23:29:36]  <Rig> What would the follow-up be?
[13-Mar-2016 23:30:04]  <BGTB2005> not get suspended?
[13-Mar-2016 23:30:31]  <IllFlower> Convince Mr. Tsukimoto that she's not in the wrong.
[13-Mar-2016 23:31:14]  <Rig> "Mr. Tsukimoto, I didn't want to draw attention to it, but I got the knife from someone who attacked me the other day in the student council room." Noriko looks down at the table, flushing with frustration.
[13-Mar-2016 23:31:19]  <Rig> Give on that conflict then.

[13-Mar-2016 23:33:05]  <Rig> Erase the knife?
[13-Mar-2016 23:33:10]  <IllFlower> Oh, yeah.
[13-Mar-2016 23:33:21]  <IllFlower> Since Mr. Tsukimoto kinda has it now.
[13-Mar-2016 23:33:27]  <Rig> Let's bump Ht for xp
[13-Mar-2016 23:33:42]  <IllFlower> Cool.
[13-Mar-2016 23:33:51]  <Rig> Since she decided to just come clean and all that.
[13-Mar-2016 23:34:00]  <Rig> Good use of fallout.
[13-Mar-2016 23:34:35]  <IllFlower> Mr. Tsukimoto blinks in confusion. "Someone who what?"
[13-Mar-2016 23:35:55]  <Rig> Noriko looks up a little, "I was attacked by one of Akamine's... friends."
[13-Mar-2016 23:36:26]  <Rig> "I managed to fend him off and I kept the knife he dropped."
[13-Mar-2016 23:37:47]  <IllFlower> "When did this happen?"
[13-Mar-2016 23:37:56]  <Rig> Remind me of the timeframe again?
[13-Mar-2016 23:38:08]  <Rig> Last week, right?
[13-Mar-2016 23:38:16]  <IllFlower> Whenever.
[13-Mar-2016 23:38:20]  <IllFlower> A couple of days ago, probably.
[13-Mar-2016 23:38:39]  <Rig> "A few days ago, I guess. I just forgot I had it in my bag."
[13-Mar-2016 23:40:20]  <IllFlower> "And you didn't tell anyone about this?"
[13-Mar-2016 23:41:51]  <IllFlower> Mr. Tsukimoto is clearly a little suspicious.
[13-Mar-2016 23:42:10]  <Rig> "It... no, I didn't know what to do."
[13-Mar-2016 23:43:09]  <IllFlower> "I see." Mr. Tsukimoto shifts uncomfortably in his seat.
[13-Mar-2016 23:43:14]  <IllFlower> "Do you at least know who attacked you?"
[13-Mar-2016 23:43:48]  <Rig> He was called... "Unnamed assailant from episode 9."
[13-Mar-2016 23:44:05]  <IllFlower> I don't think he ever told you who he was.
[13-Mar-2016 23:44:11]  <Rig> No, he didn't.
[13-Mar-2016 23:44:59]  <Rig> "He didn't tell me his name, he just said that Akamine wanted to scare me off."
[13-Mar-2016 23:46:10]  <IllFlower> "Do you at least remember what he looks like?"
[13-Mar-2016 23:46:29]  <IllFlower> Mr. Tsukimoto pulls up the roster of students.
[13-Mar-2016 23:47:07]  <Rig> Noriko looks through the roster and picks out the boy. "It was him."
[13-Mar-2016 23:47:28]  <Rig> And now someone shouts "OBJECTION"
[13-Mar-2016 23:47:34]  <Rig> And we enter the evidence minigame.
[13-Mar-2016 23:49:59]  <IllFlower> Oh, dear.
[13-Mar-2016 23:51:47]  <IllFlower> It's a first-year boy named Takadagawa. Kind of a mouthful.
[13-Mar-2016 23:53:04]  <IllFlower> "All right, we'll handle this."
[13-Mar-2016 23:53:20]  <Rig> Ominous.
[13-Mar-2016 23:53:38]  <IllFlower> He's a teacher, not a mafia don.
[13-Mar-2016 23:53:51]  <Rig> That's yet to be established.
[13-Mar-2016 23:54:00]  <Calica> 0,0yeah, but did you see the latest ERASED

[13-Mar-2016 23:54:50]  <IllFlower> "You should go back to class for now. I'll get in touch with your parents later to figure out what to do here."
[13-Mar-2016 23:55:08]  <IllFlower> Mr. Tsukimoto shakes his head. "Kouta Akamine..."
[13-Mar-2016 23:55:40]  <Rig> Noriko gathers her things and heads to class, unsure of what sort of trouble she's going to be in.
[13-Mar-2016 23:57:33]  <IllFlower> Sure enough, trouble makes its way to her after first period, in the form of Minase sauntering into the classroom.
[13-Mar-2016 23:57:44]  <Rig> Ah, an old friend.
[13-Mar-2016 23:58:11]  <IllFlower> A handful of people stare at him as he walks in. A couple back away from him. Emiko fires him the coldest glare she can muster.
[13-Mar-2016 23:58:47]  <IllFlower> He spots Noriko and makes a beeline for her desk.
[13-Mar-2016 23:59:43]  <IllFlower> "I heard you started packing," he says, not discreetly enough for Noriko's taste.
[14-Mar-2016 00:01:06]  <IllFlower> It's up to Emiko and Satori whether they get involved in this one...
[14-Mar-2016 00:01:35]  <Rig> Noriko was considering ignoring Minase, but he seems determined to get her involved again.
[14-Mar-2016 00:02:00]  <Rig> "Not really my choice," Noriko whispers to him. "What do you want?"
[14-Mar-2016 00:03:12]  <IllFlower> "Just wanted to tell you I think it's a good idea. You're a fast learner."
[14-Mar-2016 00:03:53]  <Rig> "Should I be worried?"
[14-Mar-2016 00:04:07]  <IllFlower> Minase shrugs, sticking his hands in the pockets of his uniform.
[14-Mar-2016 00:04:19]  <IllFlower> "Did you figure out who did that thing to Mayumi?"
[14-Mar-2016 00:05:31]  <Rig> "It was Rei Suzuhara, but she's run off. I don't think she'll bother Mayumi again."
[14-Mar-2016 00:06:48]  <IllFlower> "That cold-hearted bitch?" Minase laughs. "So you're the reason she's gone. Fine by me.
[14-Mar-2016 00:07:03]  <IllFlower> "I guess the brains behind Akamine's operation are gone, but he's still got plenty of brawn."
[14-Mar-2016 00:07:29]  <Rig> Noriko doesn't bother to correct him about why Suzuhara might be gone.
[14-Mar-2016 00:08:08]  <Rig> "I guess our arrangement worked out then?"
[14-Mar-2016 00:09:15]  <IllFlower> "I don't know. I'd like to punch her face in myself just to make sure."
[14-Mar-2016 00:10:36]  <Rig> Noriko grimaces. She really wants to be done with Minase. He isn't doing her any favors by lurking around her. She decides the best option is to ignore him and see if he gets bored.
[14-Mar-2016 00:11:38]  <IllFlower> "And yeah, I'd be worried."
[14-Mar-2016 00:12:02]  <Calica> "Worried about what?  Do you know what Akamine is up to?"
[14-Mar-2016 00:12:32]  <IllFlower> "Oh, look who showed up. I thought you weren't talking to me."
[14-Mar-2016 00:14:48]  <Calica> Emiko tries to avoid rolling her eyes at the response.
[14-Mar-2016 00:17:06]  <IllFlower> "Well, anyway. Apparently you actually got in Akamine's face about Suzuhara. Ballsy. Maybe stupid.
[14-Mar-2016 00:17:37]  <IllFlower> "He's probably letting you off for now so he can surprise you later."
[14-Mar-2016 00:19:09]  <Rig> "Thanks for the warning."
[14-Mar-2016 00:20:30]  <IllFlower> "That's what I'm here for."
[14-Mar-2016 00:21:27]  <Rig> But does he want more?
[14-Mar-2016 00:22:33]  <IllFlower> "Hey, you sure you don't want to join up with us? No offense, but neither of you really look like fighters."

[14-Mar-2016 00:24:00]  <Calica> I think Emiko would be against it.
[14-Mar-2016 00:24:17]  <IllFlower> Understatement of the year.
[14-Mar-2016 00:24:28]  <Rig> Clearly.
[14-Mar-2016 00:24:37]  <Rig> Satori is more pragmatic maybe?
[14-Mar-2016 00:24:42]  <BGTB2005> Satori doesn't like Minase
[14-Mar-2016 00:24:53]  <IllFlower> lol
[14-Mar-2016 00:25:03]  <Rig> Well. I think that'd give us an answer then.
[14-Mar-2016 00:25:06]  <IllFlower> Everybody Hates Minase would be a great sitcom.
[14-Mar-2016 00:25:14]  <IllFlower> The answer is "yes," right?

[14-Mar-2016 00:26:28]  <Rig> Noriko looks up at Minase. "I don't think it'd look good for any of us to join up, but it would be nice if someone had our back." Noriko looks to Emiko.
[14-Mar-2016 00:26:55]  <IllFlower> "You don't have to be an official member or anything. We'll just do each other some favors. You scratched my back, so now it's my turn to scratch yours."
[14-Mar-2016 00:27:38]  <IllFlower> Noriko looks at Minase's hands. They're not exactly masseuse quality.
[14-Mar-2016 00:28:22]  <IllFlower> Emiko looks at both of them in disbelief.
[14-Mar-2016 00:29:09]  <Rig> I think Noriko would like the backup, even if it's not the most above board situation. She did get attacked and using magic on a high school gangster is a little sketch.
[14-Mar-2016 00:31:35]  <IllFlower> Would be nice if she said it out loud. :p

[14-Mar-2016 00:40:08]  *** Icon <~icon@covering.space> has quit IRC (Client Quit)
[14-Mar-2016 00:40:15]  <IllFlower> Or at least he'll try.
[14-Mar-2016 00:41:49]  <IllFlower> I see two spare relationship dice.
[14-Mar-2016 00:41:52]  <IllFlower> Just, you know.
[14-Mar-2016 00:43:02]  <Rig> Sorry, swapping laundry.
[14-Mar-2016 00:43:17]  *** Icon <~icon@covering.space> has joined #madokamadness
[14-Mar-2016 00:43:45]  <Rig> Filling in a lot of relationships this session.
[14-Mar-2016 00:44:59]  <IllFlower> Hey, they're always useful.
[14-Mar-2016 00:45:15]  <IllFlower> Wasn't the one with Tsukimoto supposed to be a 1d4?
[14-Mar-2016 00:45:33]  <Rig> I didn't have a d4 die free.
[14-Mar-2016 00:45:49]  <Rig> I've only ever had d6s.
[14-Mar-2016 00:46:01]  <IllFlower> Oh, never mind, that wasn't from the earlier fallout.
[14-Mar-2016 00:46:03]  <IllFlower> Durr.
[14-Mar-2016 00:46:44]  <IllFlower> Minase walks out just in time for the next period's warning bell to ring.
[14-Mar-2016 00:46:45]  <Rig> Yeah.
[14-Mar-2016 00:48:35]  <IllFlower> Just a sec, be right back.
[14-Mar-2016 00:49:30]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:d27:3517:10d0:fc6c> has joined #madokamadness
[14-Mar-2016 01:01:15]  <IllFlower> Took a bit longer than I would have liked, but I'm back now.
[14-Mar-2016 01:01:29]  <Rig> Welcome back.
[14-Mar-2016 01:01:59]  <Rig> I accidentally read a comment section on a website while you were gone.
[14-Mar-2016 01:02:23]  <IllFlower> Am I the only thing keeping you from self-destruction?
[14-Mar-2016 01:03:07]  <IllFlower> Anyway, let's pick up if we can.
[14-Mar-2016 01:03:27]  <Rig> Not the only thing, no.
[14-Mar-2016 01:03:31]  <IllFlower> It's at this particular moment that Emiko's cell phone rings.
[14-Mar-2016 01:03:50]  <IllFlower> It's Noriko's turn to glare. We're in class, you idiot!
[14-Mar-2016 01:03:57]  <Calica> shit, forgot to put it on vibrate
[14-Mar-2016 01:04:22]  <IllFlower> Well, not *quite* in class, but about to be anyway.
[14-Mar-2016 01:04:22]  <BGTB2005> oops
[14-Mar-2016 01:05:09]  <IllFlower> The name "Minako Endou" pops up on the screen. A Conservator from the next ward over.
[14-Mar-2016 01:05:55]  <IllFlower> Emiko grimaces. A phone call from another Conservator usually means work.
[14-Mar-2016 01:06:05]  <IllFlower> Not the desk kind, either.
[14-Mar-2016 01:06:57]  <BGTB2005> hmm
[14-Mar-2016 01:07:13]  <Rig> "Should probably get that, class is starting soon."
[14-Mar-2016 01:07:44]  <Calica> Emiko picks up the phone.  "I don't have much time--class, you see--but what's going on?"
[14-Mar-2016 01:08:09]  <IllFlower> That is one hell of a greeting.
[14-Mar-2016 01:08:55]  <IllFlower> "We need your help." Yup, work.
[14-Mar-2016 01:10:17]  <IllFlower> "My partner went down fighting a witch."
[14-Mar-2016 01:10:26]  <Rig> Oh, that kind of work.
[14-Mar-2016 01:11:26]  <Calica> Emiko looks to Noriko and Satori and simply says the word "witch".
[14-Mar-2016 01:12:06]  <Rig> Noriko frowns. She doesn't want to have to deal with this on top of the knife issue and Akamine.
[14-Mar-2016 01:13:35]  <IllFlower> Maybe it'll be an excuse to get out of town for a bit! You know, a vacation!
[14-Mar-2016 01:13:55]  <BGTB2005> will there be a visit to the beach?
[14-Mar-2016 01:14:01]  <BGTB2005> or perhaps some hot springs?
[14-Mar-2016 01:15:07]  <IllFlower> I hear there's a really nice ice cream shop next to the train station.
[14-Mar-2016 01:15:20]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:d27:3517:10d0:fc6c> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.92 [Firefox 44.0.2/20160210153822])
[14-Mar-2016 01:15:28]  <IllFlower> Does Emiko say anything back on the phone?
[14-Mar-2016 01:15:57]  <Calica> oops, yeah
[14-Mar-2016 01:16:34]  <Calica> "We can head over to help.  How fast do you need us?"
[14-Mar-2016 01:17:17]  <IllFlower> "We're regrouping now, but the sooner the better. Can you come here after school?"
[14-Mar-2016 01:18:52]  <Calica> "I think so."  Emiko quickly checks to confirm with her fellow Conservators.
[14-Mar-2016 01:20:42]  <BGTB2005> Satori thinks, then nods
[14-Mar-2016 01:20:52]  <Rig> Noriko looks between the classroom clock and Emiko pointedly.
[14-Mar-2016 01:21:30]  <Rig> Noriko nods reluctantly.
[14-Mar-2016 01:22:07]  <Calica> Is there anything more to be said between here and the train station?
[14-Mar-2016 01:22:48]  <IllFlower> Not really.
[14-Mar-2016 01:24:10]  <IllFlower> "Oh, I didn't think all of you would come. You sure it's okay to leave Kumagawa unattended?"
[14-Mar-2016 01:24:25]  <IllFlower> It's hard to hear Minako's voice over the bustle of the train station plaza.
[14-Mar-2016 01:24:40]  <IllFlower> "I heard things were getting pretty bad over there."
[14-Mar-2016 01:25:11]  <Rig> Gonna come back to find Phone Microwave School on fire.
[14-Mar-2016 01:25:31]  *** JDAM|ThinkPad <~Arisaka@91b6-baf3-d0af-62c1-0868-64ed-a420-2062.6rd.ip6.sonic.net> has joined #madokamadness
[14-Mar-2016 01:25:33]  <BGTB2005> most everyone there's a jerk, so no real loss
[14-Mar-2016 01:26:46]  <IllFlower> Hey, there are plenty of non-jerks!
[14-Mar-2016 01:27:15]  <Calica> "They were.  But we're in a bit of a lull: possibly the calm before the storm, I guess, but still, time to help you."
[14-Mar-2016 01:29:19]  <IllFlower> "I certainly hope so.
[14-Mar-2016 01:30:10]  <IllFlower> "We've been having a spate of building fires lately. Evidence points to arson."
[14-Mar-2016 01:30:18]  <Rig> ...
[14-Mar-2016 01:30:23]  <BGTB2005> damnit rin
[14-Mar-2016 01:32:59]  <IllFlower> "The thing is, none of them seemed to be connected, so we suspected a witch's involvement."
[14-Mar-2016 01:33:11]  <Rig> "You said you'd encountered the witch?"
[14-Mar-2016 01:33:13]  <IllFlower> Noriko thinks back to the burning sensation on her shoulder.
[14-Mar-2016 01:33:53]  <IllFlower> Was Suzuhara ready to go off the rails like that, though?
[14-Mar-2016 01:34:09]  <Rig> Dark magic does weird things to people.
[14-Mar-2016 01:34:45]  <Calica> they were all that convenience store guy's property
[14-Mar-2016 01:35:19]  <IllFlower> "Yeah. Did a pretty nasty number on Tsukumo. He's got second-degree burns on his torso and legs."
[14-Mar-2016 01:35:57]  <BGTB2005> hmmm
[14-Mar-2016 01:36:30]  *** Anonus is now known as AnomatsuMatsuno
[14-Mar-2016 01:37:00]  <Rig> "Did you have a plan to tackle this witch or are we just here for backup?"
[14-Mar-2016 01:37:23]  <IllFlower> Minako frowns. "The doctors said he's going to be in the hospital for a while. His girlfriend... didn't take it well." A shake of the head.
[14-Mar-2016 01:38:36]  <Rig> Another person's significant other attacked by fire. A pattern?
[14-Mar-2016 01:38:58]  <IllFlower> Rig: "I've been trying to work out if there's a pattern to the fires, but I just don't know enough. In any case, I'm not in a position to take the witch out on my own."
[14-Mar-2016 01:40:48]  <Rig> "We'll help however we can."
[14-Mar-2016 01:41:28]  <Calica> Emiko nods.
[14-Mar-2016 01:41:47]  <BGTB2005> Satori also nods
[14-Mar-2016 01:43:08]  <IllFlower> Rig: Are you going to say anything about this pattern?
[14-Mar-2016 01:43:49]  <Rig> I don't know if Noriko knows anything about Mr. Tamura's property, but sure.
[14-Mar-2016 01:44:42]  <Rig> "About that pattern you're trying to find. We had an apostate recently that was targeting one particular person's property."
[14-Mar-2016 01:44:58]  <Rig> "Do you know if the buildings were owned by a Mr. Tamura?"
[14-Mar-2016 01:47:13]  <IllFlower> "That's... extraordinarily specific," Minako says. "I don't know.
[14-Mar-2016 01:47:18]  <IllFlower> "An apostate? What happened?"
[14-Mar-2016 01:48:40]  <Rig> "It's... a little complicated and got out of hand."
[14-Mar-2016 01:49:47]  <Rig> "A student at our school was using magic to target Mr. Tamura as part of some revenge plot."
[14-Mar-2016 01:49:55]  <IllFlower> Minako gets a dubious look on her face.
[14-Mar-2016 01:50:14]  <IllFlower> "So your problem is now my problem. Well, our problem."
[14-Mar-2016 01:50:21]  <Rig> "It may be."
[14-Mar-2016 01:51:46]  <Rig> "Sorry," Noriko mumbles.
[14-Mar-2016 01:52:45]  <IllFlower> "That's fine. It's not your fault."
[14-Mar-2016 01:53:02]  <IllFlower> Noriko fills Minako in on the whole Suzuhara business.
[14-Mar-2016 01:55:11]  <IllFlower> Her conclusion? "Yeah, the M.O. definitely fits..."
[14-Mar-2016 01:56:58]  <IllFlower> A pause to think. "I can take you down to where Tsukumo was attacked. There might still be something to work with there."
[14-Mar-2016 01:57:23]  <Rig> "I didn't think she'd reach this point so quickly. If we can get a lead anywhere we should try it."
[14-Mar-2016 01:57:45]  <IllFlower> "All right. Let's go before it gets dark."
[14-Mar-2016 01:58:04]  <IllFlower> It's been three hours since we started, so I'm ready to wrap this up and continue next time.
[14-Mar-2016 01:58:09]  <Calica> same
[14-Mar-2016 01:58:16]  <BGTB2005> sounds good
[14-Mar-2016 01:58:43]  <IllFlower> Plus it's nearly 10:00 for most of you folks.
[14-Mar-2016 01:59:08]  <Rig> Sounds good to me. Thanks for running the session.
[14-Mar-2016 01:59:43]  <IllFlower> Sure. Thanks for playing, all. I'll see you on Saturday.
