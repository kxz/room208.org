@time=2016-01-30T21:30:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, we have a better idea of why Suzuhara might hate Tamura.
@time=2016-01-30T21:30:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Still a little unclear though.

@time=2016-01-30T21:33:12.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah.  For instance, what is Suzuhara doing
@time=2016-01-30T21:33:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Magic, obviously!
@time=2016-01-30T21:34:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, if no one has anything they want to do, I can pick up.

@time=2016-01-30T21:35:58.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I don't know if I have anything for Noriko to say.
@time=2016-01-30T21:36:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We'll skip out of the last scene and pick up on Monday, at school.
@time=2016-01-30T21:37:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko arrives early, just in time to catch Takumi at the gates.
@time=2016-01-30T21:38:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hey, Hisakawa. How's it going?" he asks.
@time=2016-01-30T21:40:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He looks unusually nervous this morning. Noriko remembers him as being more of the easygoing type.
@time=2016-01-30T21:40:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(Other characters may feel free to barge in as [in]sensitively as they wish.)
@time=2016-01-30T21:41:07.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hey," she says. The weekend didn't really ease her mind. "I'm okay. How about you?" She tries to put on a sincere smile, but it feels more uncertain than honest.
@time=2016-01-30T21:43:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"My sister came home to visit. She's as demanding as ever. Says I need to spend more time studying," Takumi says.
@time=2016-01-30T21:43:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He's clearly feeling Noriko out about a sensitive subject. This is awkward.
@time=2016-01-30T21:44:30.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Is this a usual thing when your sister is over?"
@time=2016-01-30T21:44:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Suddenly, Emiko appears and inserts herself into the conversation.

@time=2016-01-30T21:45:35.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :pfff
@time=2016-01-30T21:46:02.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko's question for Takumi is lost under Emiko's bubbly interruption. 
@time=2016-01-30T21:46:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Huh? Oh." Takumi laughs nervously.
@time=2016-01-30T21:47:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well, uh, she broke her back to get into Tokyo U, so I think she's a little annoyed at me for not putting in the same amount of effort..."
@time=2016-01-30T21:47:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It always seems to me like you're busy. Between track and the student council it's amazing you have any time to study."
@time=2016-01-30T21:48:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah, that's exactly what pisses her off, see..."
@time=2016-01-30T21:48:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Emiko hears Mayumi calling to her from not too far away. "Good morning!"
@time=2016-01-30T21:48:57.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :how are extracurriculars and the like seen in the japanese school system
@time=2016-01-30T21:49:09.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Good morning, Mayumi!  How are you feeling now?"
@time=2016-01-30T21:49:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Does she want you to quit the track team?" Noriko asks, ignoring their growing crowd of companions for the moment.
@time=2016-01-30T21:49:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Calica: "A lot better!" Mayumi says. "Hope I didn't make you worry."
@time=2016-01-30T21:50:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: "She wants me to do a lot of things. It's hard to keep track.
@time=2016-01-30T21:50:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It's like she's trying to become our mom."
@time=2016-01-30T21:50:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Takumi looks aside for a moment at Emiko.
@time=2016-01-30T21:51:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He makes a small motion with his shoulder to indicate that Emiko's timing was insanely bad and that he wanted to talk in private. Oh, dear.
@time=2016-01-30T21:51:51.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And now we're on the bad ending path.
@time=2016-01-30T21:51:59.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Oh, I'm sorry.  I can step aside, if you'd like."
@time=2016-01-30T21:52:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Emiko wasn't supposed to notice, lol.

@time=2016-01-30T21:54:05.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Emiko steps aside to talk to Mayumi.  "It's okay.  You're not the one who planted the letter there."
@time=2016-01-30T21:54:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Calica: Try yelling "YOU'RE BOTH POOPYHEADS SO SHUT UP"

@time=2016-01-30T21:56:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: Takumi leans in, and says quietly, "I don't know how to say this, but did you talk to Hiroshi Minase last week, by any chance?"
@time=2016-01-30T21:57:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Calica: "What letter? I don't know what you're talking about," Mayumi says playfully. "Oh, get this, I saw the most adorable animal at the zoo yesterday..."
@time=2016-01-30T21:57:27.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko tries not to notice how tall Takumi is when he leans in to talk to her. "I... Emiko and I did," she stumbles over the words.
@time=2016-01-30T21:58:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What did you talk about?" Takumi asks.
@time=2016-01-30T21:59:01.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Emiko pauses for a second, and lets Mayumi talk about her zoo experiences for a while; if she's blocking things out, it's probably not a good idea to push too hard right away.
@time=2016-01-30T21:59:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Satori has arrived in the meantime, but is trying her best to blend in with the shoe lockers. She decided she wanted to be a chameleon over the weekend.
@time=2016-01-30T22:00:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Calica: Emiko doesn't let on that she's also listening in on Noriko's conversation.
@time=2016-01-30T22:00:34.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Minase was concerned about Mayumi. He thought someone was targeting her to get to him." Noriko is confused by Takumi's sudden interest in Minase.
@time=2016-01-30T22:00:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Mayumi?"
@time=2016-01-30T22:02:06.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko glances in Emiko and Mayumi's direction. "His girlfriend," she says quietly.
@time=2016-01-30T22:03:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Ah. Emiko's friend's boyfriend, then," Takumi says, a bit slowly as he tries not to stumble over the indirectness of the relationship.
@time=2016-01-30T22:04:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"There are some rumors going around about that. Not good ones. Like the student council is trying to negotiate for something from the gangs."
@time=2016-01-30T22:05:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Mayumi is still talking about the animal, which she has yet to name or adequately describe in terms other than synonyms for "cute."
@time=2016-01-30T22:05:27.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko sighs, "All because I talked to Minase?"
@time=2016-01-30T22:06:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"People notice these things. You're not exactly anonymous, and that goes double for Minase."
@time=2016-01-30T22:06:07.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She may have made a shady deal with Minase, but it was hardly like she'd made it in the name of the student council.
@time=2016-01-30T22:07:23.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Rumors are just rumors. Either way, I'll keep away from Minase and his friends, if it'll help you out."
@time=2016-01-30T22:08:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Sorry, it's not really my place to tell you who you can or can't talk to. Just... it might be good if you're a little more discreet."
@time=2016-01-30T22:10:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :("WHY DID I GO INTO POLITICS FUCK EVERYTHING")
@time=2016-01-30T22:11:59.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko shrugs awkwardly. "I didn't realize how aggressive the rumor mill could be. I'll be more careful. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?" Noriko is a little put off that Takumi seemed to only want to talk to her in order to tell her off.

@time=2016-01-30T22:15:47.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko watches Takumi head off and wonders what this whole conversation was about. It seems like everyone she's talked to for the last week has had some hidden agenda. Maybe she should have stayed out of the student council.

@time=2016-01-31T00:56:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno. Make a joke about the Alliance of Magicians?
@time=2016-01-31T00:57:06.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :maybe we should invite her over to Emiko's for tea and cookies :V
@time=2016-01-31T00:57:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That actually might be an appropriate thing. For once.
@time=2016-01-31T00:58:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or interrogate Chie.
@time=2016-01-31T00:58:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Because sister.
@time=2016-01-31T00:58:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also good.
@time=2016-01-31T00:58:25.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, that's actually not a terrible idea.  Or Chie, but that one with Satori probably?
@time=2016-01-31T00:58:27.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Satori can start an inquisition.
@time=2016-01-31T00:59:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Nobody expects the Satoric Inquisition!
@time=2016-01-31T01:02:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, is this the plan?
@time=2016-01-31T01:02:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Might want to send Ruri off in that case.
@time=2016-01-31T01:07:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Alternatively, we can pick up with that next week since we've already done quite a bit this session.
@time=2016-01-31T01:08:52.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :either way works for me
@time=2016-01-31T01:14:34.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :next week sounds good
@time=2016-01-31T01:15:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, we'll wrap up for now. Thanks for playing, folks.
@time=2016-01-31T01:15:18.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :thanks for hosting
@time=2016-01-31T01:15:23.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks.
@time=2016-01-31T01:15:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Next week we'll figure out what the hell is happening with Suzuhara. Maybe.
@time=2016-01-31T01:15:28.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A possibility.
