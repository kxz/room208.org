@time=2016-04-02T23:32:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(That's a no.)
@time=2016-04-02T23:32:48.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I don't think so.  Who's that?"
@time=2016-04-02T23:36:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Not a 'who.' A 'what.' And that 'what' is a drug ring."
@time=2016-04-02T23:36:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Inamura appraises the look on Emiko's face. "Not really in your wheelhouse."
@time=2016-04-02T23:37:01.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :this is getting more like durarara every minute
@time=2016-04-02T23:38:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The target just happens to be a former member of Rinzen who offered to be a police witness."
@time=2016-04-02T23:39:34.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"So the phone I found belonged to one of these members?"
@time=2016-04-02T23:40:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"*The* member. It was the phone we used to keep in touch with him.
@time=2016-04-02T23:41:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"All of the apartments that were torched were temporary accommodations under police protection."
@time=2016-04-02T23:41:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Inamura looks over at Noriko's empty desk. "Just his luck he hasn't been inside for any of the fires, so far at least."
@time=2016-04-02T23:42:16.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14plot twist: the culprit actually is Rin, who's now working for a drug ring
@time=2016-04-02T23:43:10.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"So he's still under police protection?"
@time=2016-04-02T23:45:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yeah. The thing is, the police haven't caught the suspects that this guy is testifying against. Until then, it's cat and mouse."
@time=2016-04-02T23:47:13.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hope they find them soon, then"
@time=2016-04-02T23:47:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Oh, so it's suddenly none of your business?"
@time=2016-04-02T23:49:35.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well, it's not exactly like we know where they could be anyways..."
@time=2016-04-02T23:50:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You're just going to leave Minako to fend for herself in this witchy situation? Cold.
@time=2016-04-02T23:51:13.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was trying to leave room for Inamura to say things without telling her "lol it's magic"
@time=2016-04-02T23:52:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Inamura crosses her arms.
@time=2016-04-02T23:53:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I still don't know why you're poking around, but I'd be careful.
@time=2016-04-02T23:54:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Mom can be really annoying sometimes, but she's right about one thing: A little knowledge is more dangerous than none."
@time=2016-04-02T23:57:26.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I should probably try to increase my knowledge past 'a little', then."
@time=2016-04-02T23:57:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Suit yourself."
@time=2016-04-02T23:58:16.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :not sure if I have more to say in this scene
@time=2016-04-02T23:59:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The school bell rings. Inamura gets up to go back to her classroom.

@time=2016-04-02T23:59:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That hairpin you're wearing is pretty cute."
@time=2016-04-02T23:59:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Scene.
