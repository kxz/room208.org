@time=2016-07-09T21:52:18.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Ceteris nescientibus. Who is this?"
@time=2016-07-09T21:54:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"My name's Juusakon. I'm a Conservator from the north side of town. Different precinct.
@time=2016-07-09T21:55:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I was told you had to deal with a Rei Suzuhara recently. Is that right?"
@time=2016-07-09T21:57:29.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Oh? Yeah. We had an altercation with her but she fled. Do you have information about her?"
@time=2016-07-09T21:58:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko's daydreams have gone from Takumi to taking down Suzuhara.
@time=2016-07-09T21:58:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Not so much that. There've been rumors that she might be in our neck of the woods, so I was assigned to find her."
@time=2016-07-09T21:59:28.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Oh," she says, disappointed. "Is there anything I can do to help?"
@time=2016-07-09T21:59:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Assigned? Noriko tries to think back to the last time someone told her what magical occurrences to deal with. Trouble mostly seemed to find her.
@time=2016-07-09T22:00:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Um..." Juusakon sounds a little disappointed. "I thought you'd have an idea of where she might be."
@time=2016-07-09T22:01:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Then, in a more flustered tone, "It doesn't have to be specific! Just the sorts of places she likes, or whatever..."
@time=2016-07-09T22:03:56.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Um," Noriko thinks about how Suzuhara acted in the short time they were tailing her. It feels like it happened months ago.
@time=2016-07-09T22:04:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She was focused on getting revenge for something, but it wasn't clear what it was. We think she instigated or caused arsons. She also enlisted the help of a group of civilians hooligans to help her."
@time=2016-07-09T22:05:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Arson? Is she a fire mage?"
@time=2016-07-09T22:06:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko remembers the burns from Suzuhara's touch. "Yes, almost certainly."
@time=2016-07-09T22:06:36.000Z :BGT2011 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :didn't she use lightning magic?
@time=2016-07-09T22:06:54.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Did she?
@time=2016-07-09T22:06:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, she did.
@time=2016-07-09T22:07:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Oh, um, scratch that.
@time=2016-07-09T22:07:23.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the fire was an illusion, I think?
@time=2016-07-09T22:08:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Nah, it was localized electrical conductivity. Or witches.
@time=2016-07-09T22:08:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She uses lightning magic, but that's not far removed from fire."
@time=2016-07-09T22:10:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I see. Doesn't sound like fun.
@time=2016-07-09T22:11:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well, let me know if you see hide or hair of her. We can't have someone like her running around unchecked."
@time=2016-07-09T22:13:37.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Good luck tracking her down."
@time=2016-07-09T22:13:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Thanks."
@time=2016-07-09T22:14:12.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko almost hopes he doesn't so she gets another shot.
@time=2016-07-09T22:14:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Cut to the next morning.
@time=2016-07-09T22:14:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's inter-period break, the sixth consecutive day of Rei Suzuhara's absence.
@time=2016-07-09T22:15:38.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I thought Rei disappeared for a while?
@time=2016-07-09T22:17:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Satori?" Emiko asks, looking at her friend with concern. "Something bothering you?"
@time=2016-07-09T22:17:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Calica: It hasn't been that long. Six might be a bit low. Let's say ten, then.
@time=2016-07-09T22:19:37.000Z :BGT2011 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Hmmm..."
@time=2016-07-09T22:21:00.000Z :BGT2011 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Chie asked about Suzuhara last night."
@time=2016-07-09T22:21:14.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She was friends with her sister, right?"
@time=2016-07-09T22:22:05.000Z :BGT2011 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Satori nods
@time=2016-07-09T22:26:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko joins the group, "I got a call last night from another Conservator."
@time=2016-07-09T22:26:23.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"They asked about Suzuhara."
@time=2016-07-09T22:26:41.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Did they find her?"
@time=2016-07-09T22:28:00.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Just rumors, I think. He wanted to know if we had any clues on how to track her down."
@time=2016-07-09T22:30:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So both of the Suzuhara sisters are gone. Rei the Conservators couldn't really care less about, but Ruri...
@time=2016-07-09T22:32:54.000Z :BGT2011 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think Noriko cares about Rei
@time=2016-07-09T22:33:18.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Would be nice to figure out what's going on with that family in general.
@time=2016-07-09T22:33:22.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :cares, but really in teh other direction
@time=2016-07-09T22:35:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, okay, sure.
@time=2016-07-09T22:35:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ruri's a truant, but she's caught up in something ugly.
@time=2016-07-09T22:36:22.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But yeah, we should probably figure out what's up with Ruri at least.  Also Rei because she's dangerous.
@time=2016-07-09T22:36:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"He asked if we knew where she'd likely be. Maybe your sister knew more about that?"
@time=2016-07-09T22:37:00.000Z :BGT2011 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We're probably not talking about the same Suzuhara
@time=2016-07-09T22:37:13.000Z :BGT2011 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but maybe if we find one...
@time=2016-07-09T22:37:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe.
@time=2016-07-09T22:39:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But then how would we go about that?
@time=2016-07-09T22:39:44.000Z :BGT2011 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I think she might know something."

@time=2016-07-09T22:49:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, it's time to play the "grill Chie" game, isn't it.
@time=2016-07-09T22:50:39.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What, no, Emiko's just baking cookies, not Chie!
@time=2016-07-09T22:51:53.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but yes, I think it's time to grill Chie.  Just, not like that.
@time=2016-07-09T22:52:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Man, all you people do is ask her questions.
@time=2016-07-09T22:52:52.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You're saying we could try punching her?
@time=2016-07-09T22:53:13.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't think Satori would like that!
@time=2016-07-09T22:53:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So the Conservators all meet up at Satori's house.

@time=2016-07-09T22:55:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Chie gets home a little late. She gets excited on catching the smell of cookies baking, but her expression quickly changes when she realizes who's making them. "Um, hi?" she says, regarding Noriko and Emiko skeptically.

@time=2016-07-09T22:59:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Chie grimaces, but isn't rude enough to just turn around and leave. And she likes cookies.
@time=2016-07-09T23:00:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Honestly, I don't get how the two of you are even friends with my sister, but whatever. You're here to ask about Suzuhara, aren't you?"
@time=2016-07-09T23:00:44.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Unfortunately, yes."
@time=2016-07-09T23:01:29.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko smiles awkwardly, like she's been caught in a lie. "Yeah."
@time=2016-07-09T23:02:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Chie grabs a cookie and takes a bite.
