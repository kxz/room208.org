[16-Apr-2016 20:46:40]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | RIGHT NOW: Novus Ordo Conservatorum
[16-Apr-2016 20:47:04]  <IllFlower> So, last time we left off with Inamura dropping some facts. Noriko's still in the hospital...
[16-Apr-2016 20:48:10]  <Rig> A common case for my characters it seems.
[16-Apr-2016 20:48:18]  <Rig> I need to switch to putting people in hospitals.
[16-Apr-2016 20:48:44]  <BGTB2005> take some lessons from rin
[16-Apr-2016 20:48:45]  <IllFlower> That might be a good strategy.
[16-Apr-2016 20:49:21]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I need an idea of what you want to do next.
[16-Apr-2016 20:50:56]  <Rig> Training montage of Noriko becoming a street fighter.
[16-Apr-2016 20:51:11]  * IllFlower plays "Gonna Fly Now"
[16-Apr-2016 20:51:28]  <IllFlower> srsly tho
[16-Apr-2016 20:51:37]  <Rig> Calica: Any ideas?
[16-Apr-2016 20:52:08]  <Calica> not really. BGTB2005?
[16-Apr-2016 20:52:28]  <IllFlower> You could tell Minako, for starters...
[16-Apr-2016 20:52:54]  <Calica> About the drug ring stuff?  Probably a good idea
[16-Apr-2016 20:54:11]  <BGTB2005> yeah, probably
[16-Apr-2016 20:54:44]  <IllFlower> I suggest meeting in Noriko's hospital room.
[16-Apr-2016 20:54:52]  <IllFlower> Unless you want to leave her out because you're mean and evil.
[16-Apr-2016 20:55:24]  <Calica> yeah that sounds like a good idea.  We've had a lot of scenes in hospital rooms, haven't we?
[16-Apr-2016 20:55:54]  <BGTB2005> it isn't an EmDog arc until we've had a scene in a hospital room
[16-Apr-2016 20:55:55]  <Calica> I think even the Sorcerer campaign I ran a few sessions of before reality intruded had a hospital room scene
[16-Apr-2016 20:56:59]  <IllFlower> I would suggest meeting in the courtyard but I doubt Noriko's in good enough shape to leave bed.
[16-Apr-2016 20:57:13]  <IllFlower> ITC: I have no idea how rib fractures work
[16-Apr-2016 20:57:45]  <Rig> You're a GM, not a GP.
[16-Apr-2016 20:57:56]  <IllFlower> ba dum tsh
[16-Apr-2016 20:58:42]  <Calica> I say we let her heal fast, say magic or something. :p
[16-Apr-2016 20:59:20]  <IllFlower> Anyway, everyone's in the hospital room. Noriko's well enough to talk, but that's about it. Healing magic is hard.
[16-Apr-2016 21:00:00]  <IllFlower> Minako exchanges some pleasantries with the other girls, apologizes again for getting Noriko involved.
[16-Apr-2016 21:00:29]  <Rig> Noriko mumbles something about not needing apologies.
[16-Apr-2016 21:02:04]  <IllFlower> The conversation eventually gets down to business.
[16-Apr-2016 21:02:07]  <IllFlower> "There's one thing that doesn't add up, though," Minako says.
[16-Apr-2016 21:02:26]  <Calica> "And what's that?"
[16-Apr-2016 21:02:40]  <IllFlower> "The police officer. Higashiyama. Why did she lie in wait just for us?"
[16-Apr-2016 21:04:08]  <Rig> "Why would she call us out about magic in the open?"
[16-Apr-2016 21:05:07]  <IllFlower> Minako shakes her head. "It's not that. She knows something. She *expects* something. I can't quite put my finger on it, but..."
[16-Apr-2016 21:06:25]  <Rig> "Maybe she wasn't waiting for us?"
[16-Apr-2016 21:06:51]  <Calica> "Do you think she was expecting the culprits to do magic?"
[16-Apr-2016 21:07:31]  <IllFlower> Rig: "If she wasn't, the fact that she knew of magic was a hell of a coincidence."
[16-Apr-2016 21:12:32]  <Rig> Noriko sighs, wincing a little. "You think she was ambushing us because she was involved in the original attack?"
[16-Apr-2016 21:14:06]  <IllFlower> "I wouldn't go that far..."
[16-Apr-2016 21:16:51]  <IllFlower> A pause. "I just think there's something weird about all of this."
[16-Apr-2016 21:19:31]  <Calica> "Definitely.  Have there been any more incidents since we were last here?"
[16-Apr-2016 21:19:31]  <Rig> "Maybe we should look into that organization Higashiyama mentioned?"
[16-Apr-2016 21:20:18]  <BGTB2005> I'm thinking that organisation she mentioned was the police force?
[16-Apr-2016 21:20:55]  <Rig> I assumed it was something more tightly associated with magic.
[16-Apr-2016 21:21:44]  <IllFlower> It was supposed to be the police. Probably.
[16-Apr-2016 21:22:01]  <BGTB2005> maybe worth digging into
[16-Apr-2016 21:22:37]  <Calica> she mentioned her cousin, maybe that's worth looking into?  probably not though, since that was a throwaway reference to the last emdogs
[16-Apr-2016 21:23:23]  <IllFlower> "Well, if they're targeting an informant, maybe the best thing to do would be to find him..."
[16-Apr-2016 21:23:49]  <Calica> "Isn't he under police protection?  And given our last run-in with the police..."
[16-Apr-2016 21:25:50]  <IllFlower> "That doesn't mean we have to charge in and kidnap him.
[16-Apr-2016 21:25:59]  <IllFlower> "Didn't he have a phone? Maybe we can call him."
[16-Apr-2016 21:27:24]  <Calica> ("We turned that in, and I remember names perfectly, not numbers!")
[16-Apr-2016 21:28:53]  <IllFlower> "If Inamura knows as much as she says she does, she probably knows how to."
[16-Apr-2016 21:28:53]  <BGTB2005> "Do you think Inamura might be able to help?"
[16-Apr-2016 21:31:33]  <IllFlower> Flip the last two lines.
[16-Apr-2016 21:32:15]  <Rig> Noriko wonders if Inamura is going to become their most valuable informant.
[16-Apr-2016 21:32:50]  <Rig> Is this like the part of the anime where the main group really dislikes the jerk at school, but eventually the jerk learns they're secretly superheroes and ends up joining them.
[16-Apr-2016 21:33:34]  <IllFlower> I'm a GM, not a psychic.
[16-Apr-2016 21:33:52]  <Rig> ¬.¬
[16-Apr-2016 21:35:49]  <IllFlower> "I really don't have any better ideas. Unless you want to try breaking into a police station."
[16-Apr-2016 21:36:26]  <Calica> "I think Inamura's the better idea here."
[16-Apr-2016 21:36:34]  <Rig> Noriko agrees.
[16-Apr-2016 21:37:55]  <BGTB2005> Satori nods in agreement
[16-Apr-2016 21:39:20]  <IllFlower> "All right," Minako says. "I'll leave that up to you, then. I need to look after Tsukumo, anyway. His girlfriend is a shambles."
[16-Apr-2016 21:41:03]  * IllFlower bounces a ball of wadded-up paper off Icon's head
[16-Apr-2016 21:42:33]  <Calica> the paper, once unfolded, contains a picture of handcuffs
[16-Apr-2016 21:42:42]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[16-Apr-2016 21:44:34]  <IllFlower> I have nothing else to say.
[16-Apr-2016 21:47:29]  <Calica> Do we fast-forward to Inamura or to the informant?
[16-Apr-2016 21:47:31]  <IllFlower> Apparently, neither does anyone else.
[16-Apr-2016 21:47:51]  <IllFlower> Well, I don't think the characters have enough information to find him.
[16-Apr-2016 21:49:33]  <Rig> Sounds like Inamura then.
[16-Apr-2016 21:51:41]  <IllFlower> Fast-forward, then.
[16-Apr-2016 21:51:52]  <IllFlower> Noriko needs to get out of the hospital soon...
[16-Apr-2016 21:52:53]  *** Xeniera <~xeniera@usc-secure-wireless-088-043.usc.edu> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
[16-Apr-2016 21:53:14]  <IllFlower> Satori and Emiko track down Inamura during lunch the next day.
[16-Apr-2016 21:54:30]  <IllFlower> "You're back," she says apprisingly. "Good call."
[16-Apr-2016 21:56:45]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@cpebc4dfb91a083-cmbc4dfb91a080.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[16-Apr-2016 21:56:54]  <IllFlower> She tilts a head towards Satori. "I didn't know the two of you were friends."
[16-Apr-2016 21:57:32]  <Calica> "I have a lot of friends.  It's just how I am."
[16-Apr-2016 21:59:35]  <IllFlower> "Oh, I know. I just didn't think the two of you would get along.
[16-Apr-2016 21:59:39]  <IllFlower> "Anyway, what's up?"
[16-Apr-2016 22:00:51]  <Calica> "You mentioned, earlier, the Rinzen guy they're hiding as a witness..."
[16-Apr-2016 22:01:17]  <IllFlower> "Yeah? What about him?"
[16-Apr-2016 22:04:25]  <Calica> "Do you think we could possibly talk to him?"
[16-Apr-2016 22:05:12]  <IllFlower> Inamura raises her eyebrows. "How would you arrange something like that?"
[16-Apr-2016 22:08:52]  <BGTB2005> "You said something about the phone."
[16-Apr-2016 22:10:44]  <IllFlower> "You want to call him?"
[16-Apr-2016 22:11:43]  <BGTB2005> Satori looks at Emiko. That was the plan, wasn't it?
[16-Apr-2016 22:12:52]  <Calica> "Yeah, we want to call him."
[16-Apr-2016 22:14:12]  <IllFlower> "I'd have to go through my mother's work stuff to get his number."
[16-Apr-2016 22:14:24]  <IllFlower> 14PRESS F TO CONFLICT
[16-Apr-2016 22:14:51]  <IllFlower> "What makes this worth it?"
[16-Apr-2016 22:15:37]  <BGTB2005> ("Emiko makes some really good cookies" :D)
[16-Apr-2016 22:15:50]  <Calica> hahaha
[16-Apr-2016 22:15:56]  <Calica> might be worth it but also F
[16-Apr-2016 22:16:31]  <BGTB2005> not sure how I'm going to manage but F
[16-Apr-2016 22:17:29]  <IllFlower> All right, I'll let one of you raise. We'll start at talking.

[16-Apr-2016 22:17:41]  <Calica> BGTB2005: you escalate to punching

[16-Apr-2016 22:19:09]  <BGTB2005> Calica: but Satori isn't a "punch first ask questions later" sort of person
[16-Apr-2016 22:19:50]  <IllFlower> Yeah, that's why it's escalating to punching, not starting with it.
[16-Apr-2016 22:20:20]  <BGTB2005> bust Satori isn't a violent sort of person
[16-Apr-2016 22:21:55]  <IllFlower> Anyway, who's raising?
[16-Apr-2016 22:22:03]  <Calica> I'll raise, just need to find what I want to say
[16-Apr-2016 22:22:21]  <Calica> maybe mention Higashiyama's oddness?
[16-Apr-2016 22:24:39]  <IllFlower> Up to you.
[16-Apr-2016 22:27:36]  <IllFlower> Calica: Well, maybe you've gotta give the game away!
[16-Apr-2016 22:28:14]  <Calica> "When we were around there, there was an officer, not your mother, who seemed to be expecting us.  I think she knows things about Rinzen that she's not letting on to the others."
[16-Apr-2016 22:28:46]  <Calica> @dice use 4 4
[16-Apr-2016 22:28:46]  <Omnipresence> 14Calica: Used 4 4 = 8. Bank now has 1 1 2 3 4 5 = 16.
[16-Apr-2016 22:29:50]  <IllFlower> "Couldn't you tell my mother, then? Why go directly to the informant?"

[16-Apr-2016 22:32:58]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005, it's you now.
[16-Apr-2016 22:35:55]  <BGTB2005> trying to think...
[16-Apr-2016 22:40:59]  <IllFlower> A good strategy is to offer a rejoinder to the question. :p
[16-Apr-2016 22:41:23]  <BGTB2005> "Higashiyama hurt Noriko, and you seemed like you knew something."
[16-Apr-2016 22:41:49]  <BGTB2005> @dice use 2 4

[16-Apr-2016 22:42:15]  <BGTB2005> :/
[16-Apr-2016 22:43:23]  <IllFlower> "I do, but that doesn't mean I know everything."

[16-Apr-2016 22:45:02]  <IllFlower> "You're asking me to not just cross my mother, but the police. Can you tell me what's so important?"
[16-Apr-2016 22:45:09]  <IllFlower> @dice add 2d8 >! avoid extra business
[16-Apr-2016 22:45:09]  <Omnipresence> 14: Rolled 1 4 = 5. Bank now has 1 2 4 = 7.

[16-Apr-2016 22:47:52]  <IllFlower> Raise 6 against both of you.
[16-Apr-2016 22:48:57]  <Calica> Emiko whispers to Satori.  "Should we spill the beans?"  (Is this okay, not as a see but just to discuss before?)
[16-Apr-2016 22:51:25]  <BGTB2005> trying to decide whether to interpret that as 'saying what's going on' or going with Satori parsing that at literal face value
[16-Apr-2016 22:53:44]  <IllFlower> Talking's free.
[16-Apr-2016 22:54:40]  <Calica> BGTB2005: your choice
[16-Apr-2016 22:55:18]  <BGTB2005> Satori whispers back, "I didn't bring any for lunch."
[16-Apr-2016 22:56:10]  <BGTB2005> "...That's not what you meant, was it?"
[16-Apr-2016 22:56:32]  <IllFlower> Wow, that wit was so dry I think I swaw cactuses growing in it.
[16-Apr-2016 22:56:54]  <Calica> "...I meant about magical stuff being involved."
[16-Apr-2016 22:59:51]  <BGTB2005> "I don't know."
[16-Apr-2016 23:04:46]  <Calica> "I'll tell you, but only if you promise to keep a secret.
[16-Apr-2016 23:05:13]  <IllFlower> Hm, how does this help...
[16-Apr-2016 23:05:54]  <IllFlower> If there were an applicable trait, this question would be easy to answer, but you have a Conservator relationship instead of a trait.
[16-Apr-2016 23:05:59]  <Calica> the lack of end quote is deliberate, but I'm not sure if I should let Inamura have a word in before going to the next half (which would be about how the letterbomb caused no actual injury)
[16-Apr-2016 23:06:44]  *** Medicine <~Vick@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has joined #madokamadness
[16-Apr-2016 23:08:04]  <IllFlower> Maybe I should have encouraged one of you to take that trait. Oh, well.
[16-Apr-2016 23:10:55]  <IllFlower> Meanwhile, Noriko is busy knitting or something.
[16-Apr-2016 23:11:48]  <BGTB2005> probably playing on her ipad
[16-Apr-2016 23:11:51]  <Calica> Should I just say the bit about the letterbomb?
[16-Apr-2016 23:12:09]  <BGTB2005> sure
[16-Apr-2016 23:14:22]  <Rig> I thought Noriko was undergoing rigorous PT in order to become Super Magical Girl Level 3.
[16-Apr-2016 23:14:35]  <Rig> It's the level where they get super long hair.
[16-Apr-2016 23:16:03]  <Calica> "You remember the letterbomb Suzuhara sent to Mayumi, right?  Did you know that Mayumi appeared completely unharmed to the nurse?"
[16-Apr-2016 23:17:25]  <Calica> @dice use 3 4
[16-Apr-2016 23:17:25]  <Omnipresence> 14Calica: Used 3 4 = 7. Bank now has 1 1 2 5 = 9.
[16-Apr-2016 23:18:14]  <IllFlower> Just going to give for now.
[16-Apr-2016 23:18:16]  <IllFlower> Inamura's eyes shift. "Where are you going with this?"
[16-Apr-2016 23:19:41]  <Calica> "Hmm, Satori, can you demonstrate with a small barrier?"
[16-Apr-2016 23:19:58]  <IllFlower> In a classroom? Bold.
[16-Apr-2016 23:20:37]  <Calica> it's why I said small
[16-Apr-2016 23:20:41]  <Calica> like, smaller than a desk or something
[16-Apr-2016 23:23:52]  <IllFlower> Satori hovers a hand over Inamura's desk. A small, semi-transparent square appears underneath her palm, standing straight up from finger to wrist.
[16-Apr-2016 23:24:30]  <IllFlower> Inamura taps a finger against the barrier. "What's that?"
[16-Apr-2016 23:25:02]  <BGTB2005> "Magic."
[16-Apr-2016 23:26:43]  <IllFlower> "You're kidding."
[16-Apr-2016 23:27:17]  <Calica> "No, and Higashiyama wasn't kidding either."
[16-Apr-2016 23:27:36]  <IllFlower> "Higashiyama? The officer?"
[16-Apr-2016 23:28:34]  <Calica> "She's aware, and she blocked us from getting a magical read of the situation."
[16-Apr-2016 23:30:05]  <IllFlower> "You think she's hiding something."
[16-Apr-2016 23:30:30]  <Calica> Emiko nods.
[16-Apr-2016 23:31:53]  <IllFlower> "And that's why you want to do this under the radar."
[16-Apr-2016 23:35:03]  <IllFlower> Inamura ponders for a bit. "All right. I don't know what you two are digging around in, and to be honest I don't want to. I'll get you the number of the informant's phone, but after that I'm out of this."
[16-Apr-2016 23:35:13]  <Calica> "Fair enough.  Thanks for your help!"
[16-Apr-2016 23:35:25]  <IllFlower> You sound like someone getting off the line with customer service.
[16-Apr-2016 23:36:53]  <Rig> Just like "Now that you know magic exists, thanks for being a good sport."
[16-Apr-2016 23:38:35]  <Calica> thanks for not revealing magic to the world and thus making the Order put a bag over your head and take you to an undisclosed location
[16-Apr-2016 23:39:14]  <IllFlower> And scene.
[16-Apr-2016 23:39:16]  <BGTB2005> ("The Order wouldn't do that... Would they?")
[16-Apr-2016 23:41:03]  <IllFlower> That evening, Emiko's phone gets a text. The only contents are a 10-digit string of numbers: 090...
[16-Apr-2016 23:41:14]  <IllFlower> This must be the informant's number.
[16-Apr-2016 23:43:59]  <IllFlower> So now what? Does she just call? That seems a little too straightforward.
[16-Apr-2016 23:46:25]  <Calica> what else can she do with it?  Speakerphone at Noriko's hospital room?
[16-Apr-2016 23:46:33]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[16-Apr-2016 23:46:46]  <BGTB2005> ...yeah?
[16-Apr-2016 23:47:12]  <Rig> How much longer were we running this session. My girlfriend is pestering me to make dinner.
[16-Apr-2016 23:47:59]  <IllFlower> Well, we can leave off now and make this a cliffhanger.
[16-Apr-2016 23:48:09]  <IllFlower> In time-honored contrived cliffhanger style.
[16-Apr-2016 23:48:14]  <Rig> And hopefully we can rope Noriko back into things.
[16-Apr-2016 23:48:19]  <IllFlower> Maybe next time Noriko can actually do something.
[16-Apr-2016 23:48:38]  <Calica> Thanks for running this.
[16-Apr-2016 23:48:49]  <IllFlower> Cool, thanks for playing. See you next week.
[16-Apr-2016 23:49:02]  <IllFlower> Tell your girlfriend I said to eat her vegetables.
