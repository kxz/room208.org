@time=2015-11-07T21:12:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So I guess that makes your character a Strong History character. Simple enough.
@time=2015-11-07T21:12:58.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :william can play Jun.
@time=2015-11-07T21:13:09.000Z :Nitya PRIVMSG #madokamadness :i will player stoner-hitomi who is also the reincarnation of hideko tojo, for the glasses

@time=2015-11-07T21:48:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, with this spread I have a self-confident nerd who can kinda fit in.
@time=2015-11-07T21:48:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sounds reasonable.
@time=2015-11-07T21:48:23.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Still a magical powerhouse.

@time=2015-11-07T21:50:12.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, that's what I was thinking

@time=2015-11-07T21:51:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :At the extreme you could have essentially the soft-spoken martial arts master at 2/9/2/2 or something like that.

@time=2015-11-07T22:09:42.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that's the idea.
@time=2015-11-07T22:09:47.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I could see that being maybe a 1d6?
@time=2015-11-07T22:09:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's kinda "hates being contradicted" phrased differently.

@time=2015-11-07T22:10:10.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I want to imply just a little bit of self-doubt.

@time=2015-11-07T22:12:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't *really* know where the chess is going to come in. Maybe as a kind of "strategic thinking" trait?

@time=2015-11-07T22:13:47.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She wears ridiculous clothing.
@time=2015-11-07T22:13:48.000Z :william PRIVMSG #madokamadness :her weapon?  a chessboard
@time=2015-11-07T22:13:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I said "her." It's hard not to say "her" using Enlgish in this situation.

@time=2015-11-07T22:14:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno. I'd be happy with true-to-genre teenagerdom but it's up to you.

@time=2015-11-07T22:14:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But yeah, maybe she dresses pretty sharp.
@time=2015-11-07T22:15:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just to project an aura of authority.
@time=2015-11-07T22:15:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(and cover up hideous scars, some literal)^U
@time=2015-11-07T22:16:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What are some traits for the other characters?
@time=2015-11-07T22:16:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: You don't have a lot of trait dice and for your character type they're less consequential than your relationship dice.
@time=2015-11-07T22:16:52.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I have a few ideas
@time=2015-11-07T22:16:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You can be a bit more freewheeling, I think.

@time=2015-11-07T22:18:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You do have that 1d4. It'd be cool to see that go towards something kind of orthogonal to the rest of the character.
@time=2015-11-07T22:18:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A flaw of some sort.
@time=2015-11-07T22:19:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She can't stand a particular kind of person?
@time=2015-11-07T22:19:14.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm kinda looking for one more trait that's pretty different from the rest of my character, but so far all I can pull out is that she likes some kind of physical sport or something.
@time=2015-11-07T22:19:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Agh, there I go again with the "she."

@time=2015-11-07T22:19:48.000Z :william PRIVMSG #madokamadness :BGTB2005: six dice for literalminded or just putting the traits up there
@time=2015-11-07T22:19:55.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :just putting traits up
@time=2015-11-07T22:20:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: Likes dogs or cats or something. Can't think too poorly of someone else who does.

@time=2015-11-07T22:20:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm thinking for everyone that having a trait or relationship that presents an otherwise unexpected weakness is interesting.

@time=2015-11-07T22:26:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think I get better stat dice for how I want this character to play.
@time=2015-11-07T22:27:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :trait dice, rather.
@time=2015-11-07T22:27:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: I wonder, could you do anything with the d4 in relationships?
@time=2015-11-07T22:27:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :If you stuck with Strong History.
@time=2015-11-07T22:27:52.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not in a way that properly reflects the insecurity in those traits, I think.
@time=2015-11-07T22:28:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Actually, what were you planning on doing with the relationship dice?
@time=2015-11-07T22:28:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was planning on the d4 being something like a stressed relationship with her mother/father.
@time=2015-11-07T22:28:43.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Because Well-Rounded might fit if you don't want 4d4 of Achilles' heel in traits, just a single d4.
@time=2015-11-07T22:28:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Like, pushing them to succeed in some way.
@time=2015-11-07T22:29:05.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I could do that.
@time=2015-11-07T22:29:22.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'd have to rework my stats more though, because that's another 4 dice.
@time=2015-11-07T22:29:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You get more stat dice as well, with the tradeoff that relationships are much less important.
@time=2015-11-07T22:29:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You could push the Ac a bit.
