[07-Nov-2015 21:09:22]  <IllFlower> So who already has an idea of how they want to construct their character?
[07-Nov-2015 21:09:42]  <Rig> I kinda wanted to take on the role of the super nerdy know-it-all character.
[07-Nov-2015 21:09:44]  <BGTB2005> I have a few vague ideas
[07-Nov-2015 21:09:44]  <william> i don't, aside from doing something different from Ayako
[07-Nov-2015 21:10:05]  <Nitya> my character idea is basically an extended pun about bowls
[07-Nov-2015 21:10:18]  <IllFlower> Full of marijuana?
[07-Nov-2015 21:10:59]  <Nitya> fulfills the necessary stoner archetype for the group
[07-Nov-2015 21:11:00]  <IllFlower> Rig: So basically what Kazuki was turning into, with some funny-looking glasses.
[07-Nov-2015 21:11:00]  <Rig> I am curious about this pun.
[07-Nov-2015 21:11:04]  <william> isn't it actually really hard to get marijuana in japan
[07-Nov-2015 21:11:20]  <Rig> IllFlower: Yep. Though leaning more toward what Ayako was originally supposed to be.
[07-Nov-2015 21:11:30]  <Rig> Bit less shy, I guess.
[07-Nov-2015 21:11:37]  <IllFlower> Let's all just rotate and play each others' characters.
[07-Nov-2015 21:11:41]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[07-Nov-2015 21:11:45]  <IllFlower> Less shy, more overbearing with facts?
[07-Nov-2015 21:11:49]  <Rig> Yeah.
[07-Nov-2015 21:11:51]  <Nitya> tha's the tragic backstory, william
[07-Nov-2015 21:12:36]  <Rig> Also, funny-looking glasses are a plus.
[07-Nov-2015 21:12:51]  <Rig> So, Nitya will play stoner-Hitomi.
[07-Nov-2015 21:12:54]  <IllFlower> So I guess that makes your character a Strong History character. Simple enough.
[07-Nov-2015 21:12:58]  <Rig> william can play Jun.
[07-Nov-2015 21:13:09]  <Nitya> i will player stoner-hitomi who is also the reincarnation of hideko tojo, for the glasses
[07-Nov-2015 21:13:50]  <Rig> Everyone has to wear the Kojima line from JF Rey
[07-Nov-2015 21:13:55]  <IllFlower> 危険ゴラッグは危険です
[07-Nov-2015 21:14:32]  <IllFlower> So we have the know-it-all. I guess we can have the extroverted kinda impulsive character next.
[07-Nov-2015 21:14:36]  <Rig> Dangerous drugs are dangerous.
[07-Nov-2015 21:14:48]  <IllFlower> Have we ever had any extroverted characters? Hm.
[07-Nov-2015 21:14:54]  <william> Rin, sorta, maybe?
[07-Nov-2015 21:15:06]  <Nitya> i saw pol pot referred to as "imouto ichiban" today so i'm basically never going to be clean again, so i'm just going to keep sayign things
[07-Nov-2015 21:15:08]  <BGTB2005> I think she was more impulsive than extroverted
[07-Nov-2015 21:15:12]  <IllFlower> You're thinking of exothermic, not extroverted.
[07-Nov-2015 21:15:32]  <BGTB2005> also that ^
[07-Nov-2015 21:16:00]  <IllFlower> Nitya: Hideki Tojo, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone had thought of Hideko Tojo, the genderswapped little sister military commander.
[07-Nov-2015 21:17:15]  <william> have the extroverted character who knows everybody maybe
[07-Nov-2015 21:17:45]  <IllFlower> "Hideki Tojo was born in the Kōjimachi district of Tokyo on December 30, 1884, as the third son of Hidenori Tojo, a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army. [emphasis mine]" // Well, fuck.
[07-Nov-2015 21:18:08]  <IllFlower> We do need someone who actually talks to people in the neighborhood.
[07-Nov-2015 21:18:18]  <IllFlower> You can't really brood your way to justice.
[07-Nov-2015 21:18:24]  <Rig> I can try!
[07-Nov-2015 21:18:28]  <Nitya> IllFlower: http://i.imgur.com/fTRjDYR.jpg here's my character design (for the porn edition)
[07-Nov-2015 21:18:28]  <Omnipresence> 14[i.imgur.com] JPEG image (497 × 700 pixels, 105 KB)
[07-Nov-2015 21:18:44]  <Rig> The cat?
[07-Nov-2015 21:19:04]  <william> Nitya: is that a genderswapped little sister hideki tojo
[07-Nov-2015 21:19:05]  <Nitya> ew, porn about cats?
[07-Nov-2015 21:19:19]  <william> Nitya: you read tohojins
[07-Nov-2015 21:19:23]  <IllFlower> What the hell is with the lack of pants... never mind.
[07-Nov-2015 21:19:39]  <Nitya> porn!!!
[07-Nov-2015 21:19:57]  <IllFlower> Oh, look at the failed suicide attempt in the top right. How cute.
[07-Nov-2015 21:20:08]  <Nitya> very moe.
[07-Nov-2015 21:20:25]  <IllFlower> ANYWAY DOES ANYONE OTHER THAN RIG HAVE A CHARACTER IDEA
[07-Nov-2015 21:20:34]  <Nitya> look, you're the one who highlighted me.
[07-Nov-2015 21:20:46]  <william> yeah because he wants you to become a magical girl for him
[07-Nov-2015 21:21:00]  <william> he needs that anti-entropy, man
[07-Nov-2015 21:21:15]  <IllFlower> That's it. Nitya, you're playing Haruhi Suzumiya and that's final. GOOD DAY
[07-Nov-2015 21:21:23]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[07-Nov-2015 21:21:26]  <IllFlower> /wonka
[07-Nov-2015 21:21:30]  <Nitya> i have been really busy with school. if i wasn't i really would play a stoner with tojo glasses
[07-Nov-2015 21:21:55]  <IllFlower> Bah!
[07-Nov-2015 21:22:12]  <IllFlower> But seriously.
[07-Nov-2015 21:22:29]  <IllFlower> Cajoling Nitya aside, what have we?
[07-Nov-2015 21:23:13]  <william> i sorta briefly said the extroverted character who knows everybody but i dunno if i should play that or if BGTB2005 should play that, for full dissonance ;p
[07-Nov-2015 21:23:45]  <BGTB2005> i dunno how to extrovert ._.
[07-Nov-2015 21:23:50]  <IllFlower> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/188562LJMrRIKGCnQDj2f_pDAQ50vLEU2gMGAjT0cSM4/edit # Here is a new character sheet.
[07-Nov-2015 21:23:50]  <Omnipresence> 14[docs.google.com] Character sheets - Google Sheets
[07-Nov-2015 21:25:51]  <IllFlower> Rig: Do you just want to run with Strong History, or do you want to throw some wrenches in the works?
[07-Nov-2015 21:26:03]  <Rig> No, I think Strong History makes the most sense.
[07-Nov-2015 21:26:04]  <IllFlower> I like the idea of a know-it-all with an anger problem.
[07-Nov-2015 21:26:17]  <IllFlower> *‿*
[07-Nov-2015 21:26:32]  <Rig> Hm, but then we're just edging closer to Ayako and demon possession but on a more mundane scale.
[07-Nov-2015 21:26:52]  <william> ayako barely got to do anything with demon possession anyways
[07-Nov-2015 21:27:18]  <IllFlower> Someone who hates being contradicted, not someone who'll snap and break your face in half.
[07-Nov-2015 21:27:30]  <Rig> What would you suggest as a background?
[07-Nov-2015 21:27:41]  <Rig> I mean, you could still do that with Strong History.
[07-Nov-2015 21:27:54]  <IllFlower> You could also do that with Complicated History.
[07-Nov-2015 21:28:12]  <IllFlower> Knows everything but doesn't actually know everything.
[07-Nov-2015 21:29:10]  <IllFlower> I'm just here to throw spanners in the works.
[07-Nov-2015 21:29:31]  <IllFlower> Have we ever had anyone do Strong Community? Jun?
[07-Nov-2015 21:29:42]  <Rig> I think we did complicated for her.
[07-Nov-2015 21:29:44]  <william> i think we may not have
[07-Nov-2015 21:30:00]  <Rig> Anyway, I'll see how complicated history works out.
[07-Nov-2015 21:30:22]  <IllFlower> Wait, shit, Jun was Complicated History. Derp.
[07-Nov-2015 21:30:31]  <Rig> Yeah, dead boyfriend and all.
[07-Nov-2015 21:30:44]  <IllFlower> So much for breaking the mold.
[07-Nov-2015 21:30:58]  <Nitya> only shootin stars
[07-Nov-2015 21:31:03]  <william> i'll try strong community since apparently it's never happened, and i guess that'll be the innocent one (prime for getting corrupted amirite) who knows everybody?  see how much i can actually play this type maybe lol
[07-Nov-2015 21:31:04]  <IllFlower> FINE DO WHAT YOU WANT
[07-Nov-2015 21:31:15]  <BGTB2005> Hmm...
[07-Nov-2015 21:31:51]  <Rig> I mean, complicated gets more more stat dice, which generally end up being more useful than an extra d10 if I want to approach this as a minmax
[07-Nov-2015 21:32:04]  <Rig> *me more
[07-Nov-2015 21:32:04]  <IllFlower> Well, for those of you who have picked a background, feel free to start putting down dice on the character sheet.
[07-Nov-2015 21:32:35]  <BGTB2005> I was kinda thinking of trying for the sheltered and naive type, but I'm not sure which background would fit
[07-Nov-2015 21:32:46]  <IllFlower> Rig: Yeah, but with another d10 you get to shock people with high rolls every once in a while. Drama!
[07-Nov-2015 21:33:00]  <Rig> With my luck it'll be shockingly low rolls.
[07-Nov-2015 21:33:28]  <IllFlower> That's only because you believe it's rigged in my favor.
[07-Nov-2015 21:33:40]  <BGTB2005> you should try better things to bribe omni with
[07-Nov-2015 21:33:44]  <Rig> It is.
[07-Nov-2015 21:33:44]  <william> brb
[07-Nov-2015 21:34:33]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: That sounds kind of like Complicated Community, though I know that's not *really* what "socially vulnerable" is supposed to mean.
[07-Nov-2015 21:34:53]  <IllFlower> You get an appropriate number of d4 relationship dice, however.
[07-Nov-2015 21:35:47]  <BGTB2005> I think that was the background I used last time
[07-Nov-2015 21:36:05]  <BGTB2005> but with Rin I think that was in a different context
[07-Nov-2015 21:36:36]  <Rig> Good. My stats indicate that my character is an asshole nerd.
[07-Nov-2015 21:36:42]  <Rig> With no physical stamina at all.
[07-Nov-2015 21:36:52]  <BGTB2005> lol
[07-Nov-2015 21:37:08]  <IllFlower> Congratulations.
[07-Nov-2015 21:37:14]  <Rig> Seriously, for physical conflicts that aren't fighting I have 4d6.
[07-Nov-2015 21:37:33]  <IllFlower> So you're not going to be chasing anyone down in the streets.
[07-Nov-2015 21:37:33]  <Rig> All talk, no fighting.
[07-Nov-2015 21:37:49]  <Rig> I get 9d6 for talking. :)
[07-Nov-2015 21:38:07]  <BGTB2005> I guess I'll roll with CC again, see where it goes?
[07-Nov-2015 21:38:09]  <IllFlower> Well, that's one problem from the last campaign addressed...
[07-Nov-2015 21:38:15]  <Rig> Oh, no, read that wrong.
[07-Nov-2015 21:38:27]  <BGTB2005> 9d6 for magicking people to death :)
[07-Nov-2015 21:38:31]  <Rig> Yeah.
[07-Nov-2015 21:38:33]  <Rig> So....
[07-Nov-2015 21:38:38]  <BGTB2005> Rin would probably be proud
[07-Nov-2015 21:38:41]  <william> back
[07-Nov-2015 21:38:52]  <IllFlower> Yeah, talking is ac/ht.
[07-Nov-2015 21:39:01]  <Rig> 6d6 isn't bad.
[07-Nov-2015 21:39:32]  <IllFlower> Is your character really supposed to be that good at, as it was put, magicking people to death?
[07-Nov-2015 21:40:00]  <BGTB2005> maybe there's a lot of pent-up rage?
[07-Nov-2015 21:40:10]  <IllFlower> You could do 7/2/2/2 for the lulz.
[07-Nov-2015 21:40:13]  <Rig> Not intentionally, but I think it works well for someone who thinks they know everything and gets pissed when they get corrected.
[07-Nov-2015 21:40:28]  <Rig> Like, the hotheadedness is a Will thing.
[07-Nov-2015 21:40:46]  <IllFlower> Enough to get violent about it?
[07-Nov-2015 21:40:52]  <Rig> More dice in Will means a character who’s tenacious, aggressive, confident, unflinching, strong- willed, or unshakable.
[07-Nov-2015 21:40:57]  <Rig> Quotes around that.
[07-Nov-2015 21:40:58]  <IllFlower> Because hand-to-hand fights are bd/wl.
[07-Nov-2015 21:41:29]  <Rig> Not physically violent. More emotionally violent.
[07-Nov-2015 21:41:32]  <IllFlower> I'm not saying this is a *bad* idea, just making sure.
[07-Nov-2015 21:41:53]  <IllFlower> I'm going emotionally violence my first through your chest?
[07-Nov-2015 21:42:02]  <IllFlower> s/going/going to/
[07-Nov-2015 21:42:07]  <IllFlower> s/first/fist/
[07-Nov-2015 21:42:10]  <william> IllFlower: I'm gonna emotionally violence a lightning bolt through your chest, i think
[07-Nov-2015 21:42:32]  * Rig looks at the stats.
[07-Nov-2015 21:42:34]  <BGTB2005> or a fireball :V
[07-Nov-2015 21:42:58]  <Rig> So, an aggressively clever nerd with almost no muscles or likability.
[07-Nov-2015 21:43:08]  <BGTB2005> lol
[07-Nov-2015 21:43:20]  <Rig> I can change that if there are objections.
[07-Nov-2015 21:43:23]  <IllFlower> william: So I see a social butterfly who isn't good for much of anything in a fight.
[07-Nov-2015 21:43:32]  <william> not sure about these stats but I want to do a likable type without too much fighting etc
[07-Nov-2015 21:43:43]  <IllFlower> Rig: I guess it depends on how you want to spin the know-it-all angle.
[07-Nov-2015 21:44:03]  <william> as I said earlier, playing against type
[07-Nov-2015 21:44:10]  <IllFlower> Whether it's a hollow bravado or more of a sociopathic power.
[07-Nov-2015 21:44:22]  <IllFlower> sociopathically-deployed
[07-Nov-2015 21:44:34]  <Rig> I don't know if I really like going the sociopathic route.
[07-Nov-2015 21:44:42]  <Rig> It won't mesh with the group, I think.
[07-Nov-2015 21:44:52]  <Rig> Lemme pull back and rework these stats.
[07-Nov-2015 21:45:50]  <IllFlower> Far as I see it, high Wl is basically equivalent to becoming an unfeeling force of whatever nature your other stats convey.
[07-Nov-2015 21:46:12]  <IllFlower> It's kind of interesting that Ht and Wl are never paired together, no?
[07-Nov-2015 21:46:23]  <william> hmm
[07-Nov-2015 21:46:45]  <IllFlower> For that matter, neither are Ac and Bd. I know what I'm reading into that.
[07-Nov-2015 21:46:58]  <Rig> Nerds are bad at sports?
[07-Nov-2015 21:47:02]  <Rig> Smart people are monsters?
[07-Nov-2015 21:47:29]  <IllFlower> Maybe not *exactly* the former, but they're orthogonal talents.
[07-Nov-2015 21:47:34]  <Rig> Yeah.
[07-Nov-2015 21:48:08]  <Rig> So, with this spread I have a self-confident nerd who can kinda fit in.
[07-Nov-2015 21:48:19]  <IllFlower> Sounds reasonable.
[07-Nov-2015 21:48:23]  <Rig> Still a magical powerhouse.
[07-Nov-2015 21:48:45]  <IllFlower> Leaves open the reaction whenever shit hits the fan.
[07-Nov-2015 21:49:53]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: So for a quiet character you'll probably want to lean over into Ac and Bd, less into Ht and Wl.
[07-Nov-2015 21:50:12]  <BGTB2005> yeah, that's what I was thinking
[07-Nov-2015 21:50:24]  <Rig> Perceptive and brawny.
[07-Nov-2015 21:50:28]  <Rig> But doesn't talk much.
[07-Nov-2015 21:50:45]  <IllFlower> You can spin it either of those ways, really.
[07-Nov-2015 21:51:16]  <IllFlower> At the extreme you could have essentially the soft-spoken martial arts master at 2/9/2/2 or something like that.
[07-Nov-2015 21:51:21]  <IllFlower> (Don't actually do that.)
[07-Nov-2015 21:51:26]  <Rig> Please do that
[07-Nov-2015 21:52:09]  <IllFlower> Tank. Sucks at magic.
[07-Nov-2015 21:52:29]  <Rig> I'll be DPS.
[07-Nov-2015 21:52:36]  <Rig> I guess that makes william the healer.
[07-Nov-2015 21:52:44]  <william> healer, at 3 ac?
[07-Nov-2015 21:52:52]  <Rig> Right, this party layout doesn't work.
[07-Nov-2015 21:53:11]  <IllFlower> "(nuclear physics) disintegrations per second"
[07-Nov-2015 21:53:19]  <Rig> Heh
[07-Nov-2015 21:53:26]  <Rig> BGTB2005: So, ideas?
[07-Nov-2015 21:53:27]  <BGTB2005> Rin would be proud
[07-Nov-2015 21:53:58]  <IllFlower> hahaha Rig's character is basically gonna be the tsundere
[07-Nov-2015 21:54:08]  <IllFlower> "YOU'RE STUPID BUT IF YOU DIE ON ME I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU"
[07-Nov-2015 21:54:13]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[07-Nov-2015 21:54:15]  <william> good
[07-Nov-2015 21:54:27]  <IllFlower> said while furiously performing chest compressions or whatever the magical equivalent is.
[07-Nov-2015 21:56:12]  <william> what did ayako do again?  singing, i think?
[07-Nov-2015 21:56:16]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[07-Nov-2015 21:56:38]  <BGTB2005> hmm...
[07-Nov-2015 21:57:25]  <BGTB2005> not sure I like my stat distribution
[07-Nov-2015 21:57:25]  <IllFlower> revision: "♪ YOOOOOU'RE STUUUUU-PIIIIID~ BUT IF YOU DIIIIIIEEEEE" etc.
[07-Nov-2015 21:58:58]  <william> swap Ac and Bd, reduce Wl by 1, and you'll have 5 4 3 2
[07-Nov-2015 22:01:13]  <IllFlower> The quiet one has more Wl than the social one. Interesting.
[07-Nov-2015 22:01:26]  <Rig> BGTB2005: What do think the stats say?
[07-Nov-2015 22:02:03]  <william> i was thinking my character's kind of a pushover.  maybe not a good idea and i should shift a point from Ac or Bd?
[07-Nov-2015 22:02:40]  <IllFlower> I think it makes sense for how you've framed the character.
[07-Nov-2015 22:02:49]  <IllFlower> Wl comes in for hand-to-hand and magical fights.
[07-Nov-2015 22:03:05]  <IllFlower> Not a person who's really in it for the violence or lethality.
[07-Nov-2015 22:03:10]  <IllFlower> "Why can't we all get along?"
[07-Nov-2015 22:03:22]  <IllFlower> Or, more importantly, the group's restraint.
[07-Nov-2015 22:03:28]  <Rig> An important role.
[07-Nov-2015 22:03:29]  <BGTB2005> paging Hikari
[07-Nov-2015 22:03:44]  <Rig> Because if things get tough escalating is easy for my character and hard for yours.
[07-Nov-2015 22:03:46]  <IllFlower> Hikari wasn't that good at it...
[07-Nov-2015 22:04:09]  <william> we'll see if my character ends up good at it, lol
[07-Nov-2015 22:04:30]  <IllFlower> Hm, BGTB2005's character might be the protector.
[07-Nov-2015 22:04:32]  <BGTB2005> clearly she should've been more aggressive with the handcuffings
[07-Nov-2015 22:04:34]  <IllFlower> From physical harm, at least.
[07-Nov-2015 22:04:45]  <IllFlower> This entire group is kinda weak at magic which is perfectly fine with me.
[07-Nov-2015 22:05:04]  <william> all of our enemies have guns
[07-Nov-2015 22:05:27]  <IllFlower> cows with guns
[07-Nov-2015 22:06:15]  <IllFlower> Magic we have 5/5/8 across the three of you.
[07-Nov-2015 22:06:48]  <IllFlower> Previously we had generally closer to an 8 average. Jun was the exception and even she had 6.
[07-Nov-2015 22:07:08]  <IllFlower> Granted, this was after quite a bit of leveling up, but still a pretty different balance on the overall.
[07-Nov-2015 22:07:11]  <william> hopefully we won't end up escalating i guess
[07-Nov-2015 22:07:21]  <IllFlower> Gotta be smarter.
[07-Nov-2015 22:07:28]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's move on to traits.
[07-Nov-2015 22:07:56]  <IllFlower> I think for Rig we already have "hates being contradicted"...
[07-Nov-2015 22:08:37]  <Rig> I have three that I kinda like so far, but could use workshopping. I'm not super concerned about the dice for them yet, so don't worry about what they're next to.
[07-Nov-2015 22:09:13]  <IllFlower> Are you sure your character's not really an evil overlord?
[07-Nov-2015 22:09:17]  <Rig> I also wrote down "I know what I'm doing (I swear)" but that's a terrible trait.
[07-Nov-2015 22:09:18]  <BGTB2005> lol
[07-Nov-2015 22:09:23]  <william> lol
[07-Nov-2015 22:09:36]  <Rig> Aren't all my characters pretty much evil overlords?
[07-Nov-2015 22:09:36]  <william> I know what I'm doing (or at least I think I do)
[07-Nov-2015 22:09:42]  <Rig> Yeah, that's the idea.
[07-Nov-2015 22:09:47]  <BGTB2005> I could see that being maybe a 1d6?
[07-Nov-2015 22:09:48]  <IllFlower> That's kinda "hates being contradicted" phrased differently.
[07-Nov-2015 22:10:01]  <BGTB2005> hmm
[07-Nov-2015 22:10:10]  <Rig> I want to imply just a little bit of self-doubt.
[07-Nov-2015 22:10:40]  <IllFlower> It's born from a place of insecurity.
[07-Nov-2015 22:10:50]  <IllFlower> Sounds pretty defensible.
[07-Nov-2015 22:11:03]  <Icon> Or, more importantly, the group's restraint. <~ Looking forward to the dialogue for whoever plays her
[07-Nov-2015 22:11:10]  <Rig> I just don't know how it'd ever come up.
[07-Nov-2015 22:11:22]  <IllFlower> In talking conflicts.
[07-Nov-2015 22:11:30]  <Rig> Yeah.
[07-Nov-2015 22:11:42]  <IllFlower> The self-doubt doesn't have to come up then except as some prickliness.
[07-Nov-2015 22:11:46]  <IllFlower> Kind of like in real life.
[07-Nov-2015 22:11:51]  <Rig> Yeah.
[07-Nov-2015 22:12:21]  <IllFlower> I don't *really* know where the chess is going to come in. Maybe as a kind of "strategic thinking" trait?
[07-Nov-2015 22:12:40]  <Rig> Yeah, that was what I was thinking, but I don't care for it much.
[07-Nov-2015 22:13:25]  <IllFlower> Maybe her self-assurance comes through in some completely different way.
[07-Nov-2015 22:13:47]  <Rig> She wears ridiculous clothing.
[07-Nov-2015 22:13:48]  <william> her weapon?  a chessboard
[07-Nov-2015 22:13:49]  <IllFlower> I said "her." It's hard not to say "her" using Enlgish in this situation.
[07-Nov-2015 22:14:13]  <Rig> I was planning on playing a female character.
[07-Nov-2015 22:14:19]  <IllFlower> Rig: That's actually close to what I was thinking.
[07-Nov-2015 22:14:20]  <Rig> What age were we aiming for here?
[07-Nov-2015 22:14:32]  <BGTB2005> high school?
[07-Nov-2015 22:14:41]  <IllFlower> I dunno. I'd be happy with true-to-genre teenagerdom but it's up to you.
[07-Nov-2015 22:14:48]  <Rig> I'm good with that.
[07-Nov-2015 22:14:51]  <IllFlower> But yeah, maybe she dresses pretty sharp.
[07-Nov-2015 22:15:02]  <IllFlower> Just to project an aura of authority.
[07-Nov-2015 22:15:23]  <IllFlower> (and cover up hideous scars, some literal)^U
[07-Nov-2015 22:16:25]  <Rig> What are some traits for the other characters?
[07-Nov-2015 22:16:40]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: You don't have a lot of trait dice and for your character type they're less consequential than your relationship dice.
[07-Nov-2015 22:16:52]  <BGTB2005> I have a few ideas
[07-Nov-2015 22:16:54]  <IllFlower> You can be a bit more freewheeling, I think.
[07-Nov-2015 22:17:53]  <william> I think I'm in the same boat but I'm just not sure tbh :V
[07-Nov-2015 22:18:27]  <IllFlower> You do have that 1d4. It'd be cool to see that go towards something kind of orthogonal to the rest of the character.
[07-Nov-2015 22:18:39]  <IllFlower> A flaw of some sort.
[07-Nov-2015 22:19:01]  <IllFlower> She can't stand a particular kind of person?
[07-Nov-2015 22:19:14]  <Rig> I'm kinda looking for one more trait that's pretty different from the rest of my character, but so far all I can pull out is that she likes some kind of physical sport or something.
[07-Nov-2015 22:19:14]  <IllFlower> Agh, there I go again with the "she."
[07-Nov-2015 22:19:35]  <william> lol i was probably going to play a female character too so whatever
[07-Nov-2015 22:19:46]  <BGTB2005> same here
[07-Nov-2015 22:19:48]  <william> BGTB2005: six dice for literalminded or just putting the traits up there
[07-Nov-2015 22:19:55]  <BGTB2005> just putting traits up
[07-Nov-2015 22:20:04]  <IllFlower> Rig: Likes dogs or cats or something. Can't think too poorly of someone else who does.
[07-Nov-2015 22:20:24]  <BGTB2005> ooh
[07-Nov-2015 22:20:44]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking for everyone that having a trait or relationship that presents an otherwise unexpected weakness is interesting.
[07-Nov-2015 22:20:54]  <IllFlower> We're good at thinking of strengths.
[07-Nov-2015 22:21:08]  <IllFlower> Natural inclination.
[07-Nov-2015 22:21:38]  <william> here's one that'll cause inter-party conflict :p
[07-Nov-2015 22:21:44]  <IllFlower> I like it.
[07-Nov-2015 22:21:53]  <william> cat/dog fights
[07-Nov-2015 22:21:56]  <Rig> :)
[07-Nov-2015 22:22:15]  <IllFlower> "Not good with morally grey situations" // hmmmmmmmmm
[07-Nov-2015 22:22:29]  <BGTB2005> just throwing ideas out
[07-Nov-2015 22:22:31]  <william> "good at baking cookies and brewing tea" :P
[07-Nov-2015 22:22:35]  <BGTB2005> :3
[07-Nov-2015 22:22:56]  <IllFlower> So I think the "refined fashion sense" will mostly come up in talky conflicts, again.
[07-Nov-2015 22:23:37]  <Rig> Yeah.
[07-Nov-2015 22:23:42]  <william> dazzle people by what you're wearing
[07-Nov-2015 22:23:50]  <IllFlower> Reading is good for anything that's not physical, hating to be contradicted can be a pretty generalized emotional response...
[07-Nov-2015 22:24:20]  <IllFlower> I want "I know what I'm doing" to be a d4 but you don't have any. Drat.
[07-Nov-2015 22:24:44]  <william> maybe have one magic-based trait as a last-ditch-y thing :p
[07-Nov-2015 22:24:46]  <IllFlower> I still think that kinda overlaps with "hate to be contradicted."
[07-Nov-2015 22:25:18]  <BGTB2005> hmm...
[07-Nov-2015 22:25:23]  <IllFlower> "Remembers everyone's name" // oh thank fuck
[07-Nov-2015 22:25:27]  <Rig> Yeah, but I think it comes from a more insecure place.
[07-Nov-2015 22:25:53]  <IllFlower> They both have an angle from insecurity, I think.
[07-Nov-2015 22:25:54]  <william> IllFlower: It's one of those things that makes people like you
[07-Nov-2015 22:26:04]  <Rig> True.
[07-Nov-2015 22:26:27]  <IllFlower> Yeah, I know. Maybe you can add "remembers to introduce herself" too. *‿*
[07-Nov-2015 22:26:33]  <Rig> IllFlower: Mind if I walk back and pull in complicated history instead of strong?
[07-Nov-2015 22:26:43]  <BGTB2005> maybe the two could be merged into "polite"?
[07-Nov-2015 22:26:45]  <Rig> I think I get better stat dice for how I want this character to play.
[07-Nov-2015 22:27:30]  <Rig> trait dice, rather.
[07-Nov-2015 22:27:30]  <IllFlower> Rig: I wonder, could you do anything with the d4 in relationships?
[07-Nov-2015 22:27:40]  <IllFlower> If you stuck with Strong History.
[07-Nov-2015 22:27:52]  <Rig> Not in a way that properly reflects the insecurity in those traits, I think.
[07-Nov-2015 22:28:17]  <IllFlower> Actually, what were you planning on doing with the relationship dice?
[07-Nov-2015 22:28:36]  <Rig> I was planning on the d4 being something like a stressed relationship with her mother/father.
[07-Nov-2015 22:28:43]  <IllFlower> Because Well-Rounded might fit if you don't want 4d4 of Achilles' heel in traits, just a single d4.
[07-Nov-2015 22:28:45]  <Rig> Like, pushing them to succeed in some way.
[07-Nov-2015 22:29:05]  <Rig> I could do that.
[07-Nov-2015 22:29:22]  <Rig> I'd have to rework my stats more though, because that's another 4 dice.
[07-Nov-2015 22:29:24]  <IllFlower> You get more stat dice as well, with the tradeoff that relationships are much less important.
[07-Nov-2015 22:29:41]  <IllFlower> You could push the Ac a bit.
[07-Nov-2015 22:29:54]  <Rig> Lemme see what I can do with well rounded.
[07-Nov-2015 22:30:00]  <IllFlower> I think that works for the sassy character we seem to be constructing.
[07-Nov-2015 22:30:20]  <IllFlower> "Very adept at Z-snaps 1d8"
[07-Nov-2015 22:30:49]  <BGTB2005> not sure what to do with the 6d6/how to distribute them, but I have an idea for my d8s
[07-Nov-2015 22:31:01]  <IllFlower> Barrier magic. Good pick.
[07-Nov-2015 22:31:14]  <IllFlower> We have Jun with fewer speeches.
[07-Nov-2015 22:31:22]  <BGTB2005> My idea for her is, she ultimately does not want to hurt people
[07-Nov-2015 22:31:34]  <IllFlower> I could see her passing up a lot of raises.
[07-Nov-2015 22:31:43]  <IllFlower> I think you can do that.
[07-Nov-2015 22:32:44]  <Rig> Not super happy with my d6 allocations. Kinda want to add a magic trait just to break down one of them.
[07-Nov-2015 22:32:51]  <IllFlower> william: How about a trait to bond with people over?
[07-Nov-2015 22:33:07]  <BGTB2005> "likes making tea and cookies"
[07-Nov-2015 22:33:15]  <IllFlower> Can use it to win over suspicious or recalcitrant people.
[07-Nov-2015 22:33:16]  <william> BGTB2005: i was considering something related to literally just that
[07-Nov-2015 22:33:54]  <william> "Good at baking cookies/brewing tea"
[07-Nov-2015 22:34:19]  <IllFlower> Rig: Maybe if you rephrase the contradiction trait to make it clearer that it's about a motivation to gain the upper hand in conversation or what have you?
[07-Nov-2015 22:34:35]  <IllFlower> To get it more orthogonal to the "I know what I'm doing" trait.
[07-Nov-2015 22:35:11]  <IllFlower> william: I like it. "Mind if we interrogate you in your own apartment? I brought snacks."
[07-Nov-2015 22:35:25]  <Rig> Maybe something more like "I can walk back my statements better than any politician."
[07-Nov-2015 22:35:58]  <IllFlower> Flexible relationship with reality.
[07-Nov-2015 22:36:12]  <Rig> Can't be conversationally cornered.
[07-Nov-2015 22:36:15]  <BGTB2005> Better at it than Carson, I'd imagine
[07-Nov-2015 22:36:22]  <IllFlower> ooh_burn.gif
[07-Nov-2015 22:36:39]  <IllFlower> Rig: That's a good way to put it.
[07-Nov-2015 22:36:48]  <IllFlower> Refuses to back down in conversation.
[07-Nov-2015 22:37:04]  <william> so like donald trump
[07-Nov-2015 22:37:22]  <Rig> I can force China to build a wall.
[07-Nov-2015 22:37:28]  <Rig> Wait, hang on.
[07-Nov-2015 22:37:34]  <IllFlower> Magical Girl Republican-Presidential-Candidate Kanako.
[07-Nov-2015 22:37:44]  <BGTB2005> lol

[07-Nov-2015 22:38:27]  <Rig> I want to see someone take vegetarian as a trait.
[07-Nov-2015 22:38:33]  <IllFlower> "I know what I'm doing (I swear)" doesn't have to be altered at all, ofc.
[07-Nov-2015 22:38:59]  <IllFlower> william takes "Good at vegan baking." Done.
[07-Nov-2015 22:39:15]  <Rig> "I have a refined golden American flag pin."
[07-Nov-2015 22:39:41]  <IllFlower> In Japan, though? Good luck being anything more restrictive than pescetarian.
[07-Nov-2015 22:40:48]  <Rig> I wonder how difficult it is to deal with Celiac's in Japan.
[07-Nov-2015 22:40:52]  <IllFlower> Rig: "Owns the conversation"?
[07-Nov-2015 22:41:01]  <IllFlower> s/Owns/Dominates/, even.
[07-Nov-2015 22:41:31]  <Rig> Totally won't open up to some very exciting group conflicts.
[07-Nov-2015 22:41:46]  <william> the conversation equivalence of a Dominator
[07-Nov-2015 22:42:37]  <Rig> I like BGTB2005's traits. The morally ambiguity one should be interesting.
[07-Nov-2015 22:43:27]  <IllFlower> Hm, I wonder if william's character should have a dazzling smile or something.
[07-Nov-2015 22:43:56]  <william> heh, it'd fit, i think
[07-Nov-2015 22:44:00]  <IllFlower> An innocent, cute face. Something to take advantage of in social situations, if only unconsciously.
[07-Nov-2015 22:44:00]  <Rig> Yeah
[07-Nov-2015 22:44:47]  <IllFlower> Of benefit in conflict against boys, of course.
[07-Nov-2015 22:44:57]  <Rig> Sounds like a Fallout perk.
[07-Nov-2015 22:45:06]  <Rig> +10% in combat against men.
[07-Nov-2015 22:45:07]  <IllFlower> "cannot fight someone so kawaii wat do"

[07-Nov-2015 22:45:25]  <Medicine> Extra dialogue options
[07-Nov-2015 22:45:32]  <BGTB2005> "Proficient in social niceties" I'd say that totally deserves 2d8 :p
[07-Nov-2015 22:45:39]  <IllFlower> william: I think I liked the "remembers everyone's name" phrasing better.
[07-Nov-2015 22:45:58]  <william> heh, fair enough
[07-Nov-2015 22:45:59]  <IllFlower> You can't do that unless you do introductions properly, of course.
[07-Nov-2015 22:46:03]  <IllFlower> Unless you're a stalker.
[07-Nov-2015 22:46:11]  <william> of course
[07-Nov-2015 22:46:12]  <Buttercupistiny> totally a stalker
[07-Nov-2015 22:46:29]  <IllFlower> All right, let's go down the list and talk about how we expect each of these traits to come up in a conflict situation...
[07-Nov-2015 22:46:39]  <IllFlower> Rig's we basically already went through.
[07-Nov-2015 22:46:58]  <Medicine> You guys have a full house for this?
[07-Nov-2015 22:47:02]  <IllFlower> william's character I think is going to be all about the charm offensive, except when someone interrupts her.
[07-Nov-2015 22:47:23]  <william> IllFlower: basically the plan, yeah.  The baking in particular I was thinking of the scene with whatserface where we actually did the tea and cookies
[07-Nov-2015 22:47:26]  <IllFlower> Medicine: If you want to jump in that's fine, just know that you'll have to work double time for what you missed to catch up.
[07-Nov-2015 22:47:42]  <Rig> Looks like almost entirely talking for william's character.
[07-Nov-2015 22:47:48]  <IllFlower> Yup.
[07-Nov-2015 22:47:55]  <Rig> I can't see any of those traits really working at a level above that.
[07-Nov-2015 22:47:57]  <william> Rig: yeah, that's the current plan.  we'll see how that holds once she gets into a fight, lol
[07-Nov-2015 22:47:59]  <Rig> Unless we go on Iron Chef.
[07-Nov-2015 22:48:01]  <IllFlower> Which seems about correct for what we were aiming for with her.
[07-Nov-2015 22:48:02]  <Medicine> Yeah idk I don't need to
[07-Nov-2015 22:48:20]  <william> I was considering a magic trait but eeh
[07-Nov-2015 22:48:27]  <Rig> I think the traits work.
[07-Nov-2015 22:48:40]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005's I can see except for "literal-minded." Not sure what that means.
[07-Nov-2015 22:48:49]  <Rig> It just means that you might need to give if we ever escalate too far.
[07-Nov-2015 22:49:48]  <IllFlower> "Morally grey" I can see being an extra force multiplier in ambiguous situations. "I'm sick of this, you're evil, bye-bye." It's not a trait I want to see higher than d6, though.
[07-Nov-2015 22:49:57]  <Rig> Also, reading BGTB2005's traits I realize that "Good with cats" is very important to the character.
[07-Nov-2015 22:50:30]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@CPEbc4dfb91a083-CMbc4dfb91a080.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[07-Nov-2015 22:50:33]  <IllFlower> hahaha yes
[07-Nov-2015 22:50:39]  <BGTB2005> I wasn't really sure what it would be used for, if anything, but basically I'd imagine she's not good with innuendo or euphemisms, or with figuring out lies
[07-Nov-2015 22:50:54]  <IllFlower> That sounds like a d4.
[07-Nov-2015 22:50:57]  <william> BGTB2005: seems odd for a d6 trait then yeah
[07-Nov-2015 22:51:43]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking maybe Strong Community might be more fitting, actually. It's just that unlike william's character, BGTB2005's got the short end of that stick.
[07-Nov-2015 22:52:21]  <william> now relationships is wehre i should probably just start saying things
[07-Nov-2015 22:53:09]  <Rig> Literal-minded could be swapped for something like "No time for lies"
[07-Nov-2015 22:53:14]  <IllFlower> It doesn't seem like the upbringing did BGTB2005's character any wrong per se; she just got the wrong things out of it.
[07-Nov-2015 22:53:29]  <IllFlower> Rig: That reads like the "morally grey" thing, though.
[07-Nov-2015 22:53:41]  <Rig> Yeah
[07-Nov-2015 22:54:26]  <IllFlower> I actually do feel like Strong Community would be a better match for the quiet, shy character who isn't otherwise traumatized by something.
[07-Nov-2015 22:54:36]  <BGTB2005> yeah, probably
[07-Nov-2015 22:54:54]  <IllFlower> Are we really building a party with no hideous traumas? Thank God.
[07-Nov-2015 22:55:24]  * Rig quietly erases "Dead family" from his relationship ideas.
[07-Nov-2015 22:55:41]  <william> dead relationships don't really work anyways
[07-Nov-2015 22:55:44]  <IllFlower> Although I could see there being a dead someone in BGTB2005's trait background, maybe. It just won't surface immediately in the relationships.
[07-Nov-2015 22:56:06]  <Rig> Oh, in terms of setting are we still conservators?
[07-Nov-2015 22:56:11]  <IllFlower> Parents died early and was raised by mute grandmother. Spent lots of time talking to cats instead.
[07-Nov-2015 22:56:17]  <Rig> Do we need to take that as a relationship?
[07-Nov-2015 22:56:28]  <william> oh yeah, forgot about that
[07-Nov-2015 22:56:30]  <BGTB2005> ...or a trait
[07-Nov-2015 22:56:46]  <IllFlower> Oh, yeah. I mean, the parameters of Conservatorship have changed but it's still basically the mandatory "I'm a Dog" trait or relationship.
[07-Nov-2015 22:57:08]  <IllFlower> The usual dichotomy between "fight for" and "fight with" applies here.
[07-Nov-2015 22:57:20]  <william> i think all of us forgot about that
[07-Nov-2015 22:57:22]  <william> i did, at least
[07-Nov-2015 22:58:06]  <IllFlower> I can kinda see all of these characters having a Conservator relationship rather than a trait.
[07-Nov-2015 22:58:21]  <Rig> Definitely works better as a trait for my character.
[07-Nov-2015 22:58:26]  <Rig> *relationship
[07-Nov-2015 22:58:32]  <IllFlower> Rig's is the most on the borderline.
[07-Nov-2015 22:58:47]  <IllFlower> Rig: I mean, if you're going full tsundere, definitely.
[07-Nov-2015 22:59:03]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Are you going to rework the character background?
[07-Nov-2015 22:59:26]  <Rig> I think she'd use the idea of Conservatorship as a thing to stand up for rather than use as a tool.
[07-Nov-2015 22:59:40]  <IllFlower> So she does have some honor to her.
[07-Nov-2015 22:59:54]  <BGTB2005> IllFlower: yeah
[07-Nov-2015 22:59:56]  <Rig> She's a bookish nerd. The idea of a honor excites her.
[07-Nov-2015 23:00:05]  <IllFlower> * an honor
[07-Nov-2015 23:00:07]  <IllFlower> * an honour
[07-Nov-2015 23:00:08]  <Rig> Yeah.
[07-Nov-2015 23:00:15]  <IllFlower> * æææææææææææææ
[07-Nov-2015 23:00:49]  <IllFlower> Ha, that came out looking like a pretty classical-looking mosaic pattern on my end.
[07-Nov-2015 23:01:00]  <william> it came out kinda squashed on my end
[07-Nov-2015 23:01:06]  <william> because lol monospace fontns
[07-Nov-2015 23:01:12]  <Rig> Yep.
[07-Nov-2015 23:02:21]  <BGTB2005> I'll go with Strong Community, just trying to figure out which two stat d6 to remove
[07-Nov-2015 23:02:47]  <Rig> +decide Nariko|Noriko
[07-Nov-2015 23:02:47]  <rollermine> Rig: Noriko
[07-Nov-2015 23:03:07]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Any two stats that aren't Wl would be fine, I think.
[07-Nov-2015 23:04:05]  <IllFlower> Rig: Latter sounds less odd.
[07-Nov-2015 23:04:16]  <IllFlower> Naruko is an option, though.
[07-Nov-2015 23:04:33]  <Rig> Is this a tsundere joke?
[07-Nov-2015 23:04:49]  <IllFlower> No, not at all.
[07-Nov-2015 23:05:12]  <BGTB2005> Made the "literal-minded " trait 1d4 and reworded it to better convey what I was trying to aim for
[07-Nov-2015 23:06:11]  <IllFlower> Nice. I like that phrasing.
[07-Nov-2015 23:06:27]  <william> lol, that could be nice
[07-Nov-2015 23:06:44]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005's character is a bit of a childlike protector.
[07-Nov-2015 23:06:54]  <IllFlower> Good stuff.
[07-Nov-2015 23:07:11]  <IllFlower> Okay, I have no objections to any of the traits. Anyone else?
[07-Nov-2015 23:07:33]  <Rig> I still like that cats are super important to BGTB2005's character.
[07-Nov-2015 23:07:42]  <Rig> I mean, as much as dogs are to mine, I guess.
[07-Nov-2015 23:08:02]  <BGTB2005> Should I go ahead and paste in her name?
[07-Nov-2015 23:08:26]  <Rig> Can't hurt
[07-Nov-2015 23:08:29]  <BGTB2005> ...the campaign's still in Japan, right?
[07-Nov-2015 23:08:38]  <Rig> I have assumed so.
[07-Nov-2015 23:08:39]  <IllFlower> Yes.
[07-Nov-2015 23:08:43]  <william> given IllFlower's comments about vegetarianism I assume so
[07-Nov-2015 23:08:52]  <william> which means that I'm not coming up with any names still, basically :P
[07-Nov-2015 23:10:00]  <IllFlower> "Satori"
[07-Nov-2015 23:10:06]  <IllFlower> fry_see_what_you_did_there.gif
[07-Nov-2015 23:10:13]  <william> another touhou i see
[07-Nov-2015 23:10:21]  <william> and i'm guessing nakajima is some car thing
[07-Nov-2015 23:10:26]  <Rig> Y'all are too weeb.
[07-Nov-2015 23:10:36]  <BGTB2005> :3
[07-Nov-2015 23:10:59]  <BGTB2005> william: yep
[07-Nov-2015 23:11:01]  <IllFlower> Satori isn't really a name that people use, either.
[07-Nov-2015 23:11:07]  <Rig> @g Kazuki Nakajima
[07-Nov-2015 23:11:07]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Google: (1/10) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuki_Nakajima — Kazuki Nakajima - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: Kazuki Nakajima (中嶋 一貴, Nakajima Kazuki, born January 11, 1985) is a professional racing driver who drove in Formula One for (+2592 more characters)
[07-Nov-2015 23:11:08]  <william> isn't it a mythological creature
[07-Nov-2015 23:11:09]  <IllFlower> It's a nice Japanese Buddhist term, however.
[07-Nov-2015 23:11:21]  <IllFlower> >Kazuki
[07-Nov-2015 23:11:41]  <IllFlower> william: No, it's the term for enlighenment or awakening.
[07-Nov-2015 23:12:22]  <IllFlower> Oh, oh, you mean [[satori (folklore)]], yeah.

[07-Nov-2015 23:12:42]  <Rig> I was thinking that we should all probably be members of the same class.
[07-Nov-2015 23:12:47]  <IllFlower> We can move on to relationships.
[07-Nov-2015 23:13:01]  <william> Rig: that'd probably be a good idea.  Maybe have overlap in relationships even
[07-Nov-2015 23:13:10]  <IllFlower> gasp
[07-Nov-2015 23:13:12]  <Rig> Yeah, I was thinking that'd be wise.
[07-Nov-2015 23:13:21]  <Rig> And cut down on the number of names we have to memorize.
[07-Nov-2015 23:13:49]  <IllFlower> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AtdE4-xvs1rHPAhzMlcF37DvZ-2gJ_pQyT_PUlI58nI/edit # conveniently I created an empty doc where you can scribble detailed notes about this sort of thing
[07-Nov-2015 23:13:49]  <Omnipresence> 14[docs.google.com] Setting brainstorming - Google Docs
[07-Nov-2015 23:16:05]  <IllFlower> Anyway, let's discuss in here first before committing to too much in the doc.
[07-Nov-2015 23:16:17]  <william> what do class reps do again
[07-Nov-2015 23:16:21]  <Rig> Sure. But my question is kinda valid.
[07-Nov-2015 23:16:33]  <Rig> I have no idea how Japanese schools work and only a vague idea from anime.
[07-Nov-2015 23:16:53]  <IllFlower> Rig: The answer to all your yes/no questions is "yes."
[07-Nov-2015 23:17:04]  <Rig> Cool.
[07-Nov-2015 23:17:08]  <Rig> Anime didn't entirely lie to me.
[07-Nov-2015 23:17:42]  <IllFlower> You've actually lived there!
[07-Nov-2015 23:17:48]  <Rig> I went to a DoD school.
[07-Nov-2015 23:17:57]  <IllFlower> Osmosis!
[07-Nov-2015 23:18:01]  <BGTB2005> whatever class reps do, I think Rig's character should be one :p
[07-Nov-2015 23:18:20]  <Rig> That's not how culture works!
[07-Nov-2015 23:18:24]  <IllFlower> Mostly boss people around.
[07-Nov-2015 23:18:30]  <IllFlower> Well, Noriko would.
[07-Nov-2015 23:18:35]  <Rig> Sounds like something my characters do a lot.
[07-Nov-2015 23:19:17]  <IllFlower> She secretly has a crush on the student council president.
[07-Nov-2015 23:19:22]  <IllFlower> Because that's how this always works.
[07-Nov-2015 23:19:29]  <Rig> And I have to learn to fence?
[07-Nov-2015 23:19:32]  <Rig> And turn into cars?
[07-Nov-2015 23:19:48]  <IllFlower> Stop making everything Utena.
[07-Nov-2015 23:20:08]  * william checks stopwatch
[07-Nov-2015 23:20:47]  <Rig> william's character runs the High School Hostess Club?
[07-Nov-2015 23:21:20]  * IllFlower spittakes
[07-Nov-2015 23:22:47]  <IllFlower> In all seriousness, you can scribble down ideas like with traits.
[07-Nov-2015 23:23:14]  <IllFlower> You will then be judged harshly.
[07-Nov-2015 23:23:24]  <Buttercupistiny> he has to go baste some lamb, he's taking his laptop down
[07-Nov-2015 23:23:25]  <IllFlower> Just kidding.
[07-Nov-2015 23:23:48]  <Buttercupistiny> he is taking over lamb basting duties while my dad is at the store
[07-Nov-2015 23:25:15]  <Icon> Are we really building a party with no hideous traumas? Thank God. <~ Impressive.
[07-Nov-2015 23:25:34]  <Rig> So, do we want to focus this in on the school level or the neighborhood level?
[07-Nov-2015 23:25:47]  <IllFlower> I was thinking more the latter.
[07-Nov-2015 23:26:01]  <IllFlower> I dunno if having everything be school is that interesting.
[07-Nov-2015 23:26:08]  <Rig> Yeah.
[07-Nov-2015 23:26:21]  <Rig> So, got three ideas for relationships. One of which is not serious.
[07-Nov-2015 23:26:42]  <IllFlower> Plus it gives a little more opportunity for believably serious shit. Like dead people shit, should the occasion arise.
[07-Nov-2015 23:27:45]  <IllFlower> I'll try to keep the scope a little more familiar than in the last campaign, though, so we don't go jumping from problem to unrelated problem.
[07-Nov-2015 23:28:21]  <IllFlower> >Western animation club memer
[07-Nov-2015 23:28:35]  <william> member, but memer might also apply
[07-Nov-2015 23:28:37]  <IllFlower> You forgot the Conservators.
[07-Nov-2015 23:28:47]  <Icon> Can I see a link to the character sheets please
[07-Nov-2015 23:28:54]  <Rig> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/188562LJMrRIKGCnQDj2f_pDAQ50vLEU2gMGAjT0cSM4/edit#gid=0
[07-Nov-2015 23:28:55]  <Omnipresence> 14[docs.google.com] Character sheets - Google Sheets
[07-Nov-2015 23:29:05]  <Icon> Thanks.
[07-Nov-2015 23:29:49]  <Icon> Rig's character, unsurprisingly, sounds most interesting to me
[07-Nov-2015 23:30:39]  <Rig> IllFlower: Judgements on any of this?
[07-Nov-2015 23:31:29]  <Rig> Icon: A lot of it was shaped by IllFlower's ideas. I basically just knew that I wanted to play Ayako-like.
[07-Nov-2015 23:31:46]  <IllFlower> I hope the animation club is the non-serious one.
[07-Nov-2015 23:31:50]  <Rig> It is.
[07-Nov-2015 23:31:55]  <Icon> Rig: Mmm.
[07-Nov-2015 23:32:14]  *** Buttercupistiny <~chatzilla@2602:306:834e:5390:90f7:bf95:51d8:5fa6> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 206 seconds)
[07-Nov-2015 23:32:21]  <Rig> william is having some wifi troubles I hear.
[07-Nov-2015 23:33:26]  <Rig> Should we have relationships with the other characters?
[07-Nov-2015 23:33:27]  <william> back
[07-Nov-2015 23:33:39]  <william> and I was thinking maybe one other relationship
[07-Nov-2015 23:33:45]  <IllFlower> Gimme just a second.
[07-Nov-2015 23:33:46]  <BGTB2005> ...I though that was the plan?
[07-Nov-2015 23:33:51]  <BGTB2005> *thought
[07-Nov-2015 23:34:51]  <IllFlower> Yeah. Dice are up to you.
[07-Nov-2015 23:35:04]  <Rig> I mean, they should know each other, I just wasn't sure if relationships should be assigned.
[07-Nov-2015 23:35:14]  <IllFlower> I could see Noriko being kinda aloof
[07-Nov-2015 23:35:15]  <IllFlower> .
[07-Nov-2015 23:36:03]  <IllFlower> Actually, yeah, I think the characters can get away with just the general Conservator relationship.
[07-Nov-2015 23:36:17]  <Rig> Yeah, otherwise it eats up some dice.
[07-Nov-2015 23:36:20]  <william> none of my relationships are dice-assigned at this point
[07-Nov-2015 23:37:03]  <IllFlower> We can blur things and say that relationship can be applied as if it were a relationship with the other individual player characters.
[07-Nov-2015 23:37:27]  <IllFlower> So, for instance, if one of the other PCs is at stake, you can use that relationship. Only once, though.
[07-Nov-2015 23:37:57]  <IllFlower> Hm, we never had place or sin relationships. Those could be interesting, but we'll leave them aside for now.
[07-Nov-2015 23:37:57]  <Rig> That works for me.
[07-Nov-2015 23:38:13]  <Rig> Sin: Too Damn Smart
[07-Nov-2015 23:38:16]  <Rig> 2d8
[07-Nov-2015 23:38:28]  <william> Sin: Pride, 2d4
[07-Nov-2015 23:38:31]  <BGTB2005> I think we've used the Conservator relationship before when we didn't have specific relationships?
[07-Nov-2015 23:38:43]  <IllFlower> Well, I'll codify that officially.
[07-Nov-2015 23:39:05]  <Rig> What relationships should we share?
[07-Nov-2015 23:39:35]  <IllFlower> Most likely would be someone at school.
[07-Nov-2015 23:39:43]  <IllFlower> And some folks' parents might know each other.
[07-Nov-2015 23:40:02]  <Rig> What's a school rep? Is it like a class president? A super class rep?
[07-Nov-2015 23:40:19]  <william> that was supposed to be class rep
[07-Nov-2015 23:40:22]  <william> but i had a brainfart
[07-Nov-2015 23:40:37]  <BGTB2005> I still say Noriko should be class rep
[07-Nov-2015 23:40:47]  <william> brb
[07-Nov-2015 23:40:49]  <Rig> Could be interesting.
[07-Nov-2015 23:41:52]  <william> back
[07-Nov-2015 23:42:45]  <Rig> IllFlower: Ideas for relationships?
[07-Nov-2015 23:42:49]  <william> i feel like i should add one from one of the others, so we have overlap
[07-Nov-2015 23:42:56]  <Rig> Thoughts on Noriko being class rep?
[07-Nov-2015 23:43:23]  <IllFlower> I say go with it.
[07-Nov-2015 23:43:46]  <IllFlower> It would be nice if Noriko had a specific relationship with someone her age.
[07-Nov-2015 23:44:01]  <BGTB2005> maybe someone she has a crush on
[07-Nov-2015 23:44:11]  <IllFlower> Maybe someone she met through student council.
[07-Nov-2015 23:44:21]  * IllFlower hits BGTB2005 over the head with a paper fan
[07-Nov-2015 23:44:30]  <BGTB2005> ow
[07-Nov-2015 23:44:35]  <william> oh yeah, we don't have any living boyfriends/girlfriends yet
[07-Nov-2015 23:44:46]  <william> fuck it, my girl now has a boyfriend
[07-Nov-2015 23:45:04]  <IllFlower> She'd be the most likely to have one.
[07-Nov-2015 23:45:22]  <IllFlower> Remember that you don't have to assign all the dice and you probably shouldn't.
[07-Nov-2015 23:45:45]  <william> oh yeah
[07-Nov-2015 23:45:47]  <IllFlower> If you have a "parents" relationship you should decide whether it's important enough to merit more than the default 1d6.
[07-Nov-2015 23:45:50]  <william> well i have ten dice so
[07-Nov-2015 23:46:01]  <Rig> I have far fewer.
[07-Nov-2015 23:46:01]  <IllFlower> Also think of if your characters have any other family members.
[07-Nov-2015 23:46:03]  <william> and forgot about that
[07-Nov-2015 23:46:31]  <IllFlower> Also also think of how your character would know a person if it isn't obvious. They have to be more than casual acquaintances.
[07-Nov-2015 23:47:03]  <IllFlower> Yes, I am going to demand that you explain why that special someone is special.
[07-Nov-2015 23:48:01]  <Rig> Okay, I think I could spend another 1d6 on a relationship, but I dunno who it should be.
[07-Nov-2015 23:48:22]  <BGTB2005> someone she has a crush on and/or met through student council :p
[07-Nov-2015 23:48:36]  <william> BGTB2005 really wants noriko to have a crush
[07-Nov-2015 23:48:45]  <Rig> I already have a student council member that may or may not be a crush.
[07-Nov-2015 23:48:52]  <BGTB2005> shipping goggles are welded to my face
[07-Nov-2015 23:50:06]  <Rig> I'd love to grab someone else's relationship, but I'm not sure why Noriko would have a relationship with anyone listed.
[07-Nov-2015 23:50:16]  <Rig> Maybe Satori's sister?
[07-Nov-2015 23:50:23]  <Rig> Like a mentorship kinda thing?
[07-Nov-2015 23:50:26]  <IllFlower> The track and field team was a good one.
[07-Nov-2015 23:50:33]  <Rig> I did like the track & field team.
[07-Nov-2015 23:50:38]  <william> yeah, I liked that one
[07-Nov-2015 23:50:39]  <IllFlower> Might be in charge of coordinating their events.
[07-Nov-2015 23:50:54]  <william> considered/considering poaching that one tbh
[07-Nov-2015 23:51:06]  <Rig> Your boyfriend could be from it.
[07-Nov-2015 23:51:10]  <IllFlower> For Satori I think having strong family connections makes sense, if she was as sheltered as BGTB2005 makes her out to be.
[07-Nov-2015 23:52:20]  <Rig> I have to take my dog out. Be back in 10 minutes or so.
[07-Nov-2015 23:52:21]  <BGTB2005> hmm...
[07-Nov-2015 23:52:45]  <william> If Noriko's the class rep, should I work out the relationship with Iverum if I want to keep that?

[07-Nov-2015 23:57:36]  <IllFlower> You can pretend.
[07-Nov-2015 23:59:54]  <IllFlower> I'm going to try and think of a name for your character.
[08-Nov-2015 00:00:31]  <IllFlower> I kinda want to do Emiko or Emiri or something like that.
[08-Nov-2015 00:00:42]  <william> what do those mean
[08-Nov-2015 00:01:22]  <IllFlower> It's rather transparently from 'emi' for smile but eh.
[08-Nov-2015 00:04:28]  <BGTB2005> hmm...
[08-Nov-2015 00:05:36]  <Rig> Well, if you're gonna be friends with Noriko then we should flesh that out a little.
[08-Nov-2015 00:05:54]  <william> Rig: yeah.
[08-Nov-2015 00:05:58]  <william> brb again >_>
[08-Nov-2015 00:06:07]  <IllFlower> Oh, you could do Akira. Or Akiko. Though we had an Akiko.
[08-Nov-2015 00:07:31]  *** Buttercupistiny <~chatzilla@2602:306:834e:5390:90f7:bf95:51d8:5fa6> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 206 seconds)
[08-Nov-2015 00:08:22]  <william> back and shouldn't have to brb for that again
[08-Nov-2015 00:08:47]  <Rig> Any thoughts on relationship with Noriko?
[08-Nov-2015 00:09:23]  <william> maybe people keep asking $character to talk to Noriko for them because they're scared of the latter or something
[08-Nov-2015 00:11:32]  <IllFlower> That would make some sense.
[08-Nov-2015 00:11:35]  <Rig> Yeah.
[08-Nov-2015 00:11:52]  <IllFlower> "How can you deal with her?" "We, uh work together on a lot of things."
[08-Nov-2015 00:13:12]  <IllFlower> william: Name's ultimately up to you, even if it's just an up-or-down.
[08-Nov-2015 00:16:48]  <william> IllFlower: alright, I think connection issues mean I'll need to refreshif you added things
[08-Nov-2015 00:17:03]  <IllFlower> I didn't, not yet.
[08-Nov-2015 00:19:56]  <IllFlower> Kotani? Just tossing around surnames.
[08-Nov-2015 00:20:27]  <william> what's it mean slash is it referencing anything?
[08-Nov-2015 00:20:31]  <IllFlower> Nope.
[08-Nov-2015 00:21:03]  <IllFlower> I'm trying to think of ones that don't look like the rest.
[08-Nov-2015 00:21:30]  <IllFlower> 2 sur + 2 fore kanji, 6 fore + 8 sur letters in romanization.
[08-Nov-2015 00:22:26]  <william> aha, yeah.  I'm not picky, tbh; what would "akira" and "akiko" mean again?
[08-Nov-2015 00:22:47]  <william> (although I think the name Akira would just lead to Nitya or someone yelling TETSUOOOOOOO and KANEDAAAAAA in channel)
[08-Nov-2015 00:23:04]  <Icon> Akiro.
[08-Nov-2015 00:23:11]  <IllFlower> That's off a character for light though you can just pick a meaning.
[08-Nov-2015 00:23:12]  <Nitya> just tell me when baby.
[08-Nov-2015 00:23:56]  <IllFlower> Azuma?

[08-Nov-2015 00:25:20]  <william> But yeah, whatever's fine, really
[08-Nov-2015 00:25:21]  <IllFlower> Komiyama?
[08-Nov-2015 00:25:28]  <Rig> I like Azuma.
[08-Nov-2015 00:26:32]  <IllFlower> Emiko?
[08-Nov-2015 00:26:58]  <IllFlower> Oh, here's a long surname. Teshigahara.
[08-Nov-2015 00:27:08]  <BGTB2005> I think Emiko sounds nice
[08-Nov-2015 00:27:25]  <william> is "gahara" a common name component
[08-Nov-2015 00:27:45]  <IllFlower> It just means "field of."
[08-Nov-2015 00:28:58]  <IllFlower> I know I distracted everyone, but we've still gotta sort out our relationships.
[08-Nov-2015 00:29:46]  <IllFlower> Rig: So what's the particular relationship with the student council member?
[08-Nov-2015 00:30:02]  <IllFlower> Is that SCM on the track and field club? Would be fun.
[08-Nov-2015 00:30:35]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Who's in Satori's family?
[08-Nov-2015 00:30:59]  <BGTB2005> Parents, little sister
[08-Nov-2015 00:31:03]  <IllFlower> You know, I'm increasingly feeling like, just from the name and the background, that Satori grew up in something like a cult, or at least a very fervently new religious family.
[08-Nov-2015 00:31:28]  <Rig> I think it'd be good to tie the SCM guy back to the track & field team.
[08-Nov-2015 00:32:22]  <Rig> If we're going with our team being high school freshmen then I was thinking he'd be like an upperclassman that Noriko met through her parent's friendship with his parents.
[08-Nov-2015 00:32:50]  <IllFlower> That would make sense.
[08-Nov-2015 00:32:52]  <Rig> And he kind of inspired her to try to get into the student council and she kind of treats him as a mentor/crush.
[08-Nov-2015 00:33:01]  <IllFlower> We've kinda lost the relationships with folks outside of school, though.
[08-Nov-2015 00:33:12]  <Rig> Yeah, I still have dice for at least one more.
[08-Nov-2015 00:33:41]  <william> IllFlower: The boyfriend could be outside of school, maybe, dunno
[08-Nov-2015 00:36:08]  <IllFlower> Rig: I think the convenience store owner would be a better candidate for the "friend of parents" method of acquaintance.
[08-Nov-2015 00:37:06]  <Rig> I'm not sure what sort of outside school friends they'd have.

[08-Nov-2015 00:40:05]  <IllFlower> The student council member I imagine would be more of a self-contained crush.
[08-Nov-2015 00:40:21]  <IllFlower> If a crush. Met through student council, interacts mostly through it, etc.
[08-Nov-2015 00:40:31]  <IllFlower> Don't let me rain your parade, though.
[08-Nov-2015 00:40:35]  <IllFlower> Rain on, rather.
[08-Nov-2015 00:40:45]  <Rig> That works for me.

[08-Nov-2015 00:46:28]  <IllFlower> We'll do initiations later, I suppose. >_>
[08-Nov-2015 00:48:44]  <Rig> Yeah, I think it'd take another while to do that.
[08-Nov-2015 00:49:30]  <Rig> I want to do like a tablet or something as a belonging, but that seems weird.
[08-Nov-2015 00:49:56]  <william> back
[08-Nov-2015 00:50:07]  <william> Rig: like an iPad or whatever?
[08-Nov-2015 00:50:08]  <IllFlower> An iPad tablet or a stone tablet?
[08-Nov-2015 00:50:17]  <Rig> An iPad/Kindle sorta thing
[08-Nov-2015 00:50:17]  <IllFlower> "Is Moses 4d10"
[08-Nov-2015 00:50:20]  <BGTB2005> the latter, cearly
[08-Nov-2015 00:50:53]  <IllFlower> She could use it as her "I know you're wrong and to prove it I'll look it up on the internet" tool.
[08-Nov-2015 00:51:40]  <BGTB2005> More mundanely, I think maybe it could be useful for her tasks as class rep?
[08-Nov-2015 00:52:07]  <IllFlower> Yeah, but if it's not got a conflict bearing it probably doesn't need to be on the character sheet as a belonging.
[08-Nov-2015 00:52:26]  <Rig> I like the idea of using it as a tool to prove people wrong.
[08-Nov-2015 00:53:18]  <Rig> I don't have a lot of ideas for belongings here though. Maybe some magic artifact?
[08-Nov-2015 00:54:36]  <IllFlower> Something that gives her strength when she's having her doubty moments.
[08-Nov-2015 00:55:55]  <BGTB2005> I'm not sure what Satori would have
[08-Nov-2015 00:57:50]  <Rig> Track shoes. :P
[08-Nov-2015 00:58:47]  <william> yeah, that's useful
[08-Nov-2015 00:59:04]  <BGTB2005> 2d6 good pair of running shoes?
[08-Nov-2015 00:59:46]  <Rig> Hm.
[08-Nov-2015 01:00:02]  <william> 2d6 cellphone constantly running off the hook ("cellphones don't have hooks!")
[08-Nov-2015 01:01:00]  <BGTB2005> I was thinking maybe Satori might have a phone charm or something that either her little sister or best friend made/got for her, but I don't think it's dice-worthy
[08-Nov-2015 01:01:21]  <IllFlower> A bottle of pepper spray.
[08-Nov-2015 01:02:13]  <IllFlower> A magical artifact of some sort.
[08-Nov-2015 01:02:28]  <william> none of us have magical weapons yet
[08-Nov-2015 01:02:28]  <Rig> william: 1d6 spare battery for cellphone
[08-Nov-2015 01:02:58]  <IllFlower> Satori has a locket that she wears that's been passed down in her family for at least a century and she doesn't know it's got magic.
[08-Nov-2015 01:03:27]  <BGTB2005> lol, sure
[08-Nov-2015 01:03:50]  <IllFlower> We do need to wrap up in the next half hour since I have to be elsewhere.
[08-Nov-2015 01:05:09]  <Rig> I think I'm fairly satisfied with where Noriko is. Any objections to her?
[08-Nov-2015 01:05:16]  <Rig> Anything I should flesh out more?
[08-Nov-2015 01:06:09]  <IllFlower> If you have any more details to provide about Noriko's relationships that you'd like to sneak in, you can do it in the auxiliary doc.
[08-Nov-2015 01:06:14]  <BGTB2005> maybe a 1d6 Locket, +1d4 for protective magic or something?
[08-Nov-2015 01:06:27]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Sure.
[08-Nov-2015 01:06:56]  <william> hmmm, what should Emiko have as a possession
[08-Nov-2015 01:07:55]  *** Lin_Chong <~Kevin@116.87.102.42> has joined #madokamadness
[08-Nov-2015 01:08:31]  <IllFlower> I don't know if there's anything too important to her character that she needs. The pepper spray might be a nice believable edge to the character but I'm not too attached to the idea.
[08-Nov-2015 01:08:55]  <IllFlower> "too attached" = won't kill me if you don't do it
[08-Nov-2015 01:09:11]  <william> Would pepper spray count as a magical weapon for this?
[08-Nov-2015 01:09:17]  <IllFlower> Nah.
[08-Nov-2015 01:09:27]  <IllFlower> Think of it this way: it's not a gun.
[08-Nov-2015 01:10:16]  <william> true
[08-Nov-2015 01:10:43]  <IllFlower> I think we're safe to wrap up here. Any objections?
[08-Nov-2015 01:10:52]  <william> nope
[08-Nov-2015 01:10:59]  <IllFlower> These girls are going to be relative novices to magic but I think that works well.
[08-Nov-2015 01:11:01]  <BGTB2005> Would I be able to get away with giving Satori a magical staff as well?
[08-Nov-2015 01:11:33]  <Rig> I'm good with where we are. I added a little more detail to the setting document.
[08-Nov-2015 01:11:41]  <IllFlower> Let's sit on it for now. I dunno if it really works with the character.
[08-Nov-2015 01:12:21]  <william> yeah, I'm gonna think of stuff to add to the setting document
[08-Nov-2015 01:12:40]  <IllFlower> Cool. In the meantime, we'll wrap up our official session block for this week.
[08-Nov-2015 01:12:42]  <william> Oh, and maybe give the best friend and boyfriend a name but
[08-Nov-2015 01:13:09]  <BGTB2005> Satori and Emiko should totally be best friends :p
[08-Nov-2015 01:13:15]  <IllFlower> Let's plan on doing initiations and whatever we can of a first session next week, continuing the week after, and we'll break for Thanksgiving.
[08-Nov-2015 01:13:23]  <IllFlower> Thanks, everyone!
[08-Nov-2015 01:13:26]  <BGTB2005> sounds good
