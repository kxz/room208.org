@time=2016-02-14T21:31:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How do we want to proceed from here?
@time=2016-02-14T21:32:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I recall some support for taking the fight to Akamine while Suzuhara is busy not being part of the immediate action.
@time=2016-02-14T21:33:01.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I think having that meeting with Akamine might be a good thing.
@time=2016-02-14T21:33:01.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I tihnk there was some teenage awkwardness you threatened to push to this session but can't tell if that was a joke
@time=2016-02-14T21:33:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, it was, but maybe Rig feels differently, I dunno. ;)

@time=2016-02-14T21:36:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :All right, then, let's start with fighting. Like we always do.
@time=2016-02-14T21:36:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What's the plan?
@time=2016-02-14T21:37:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Should we start with the gang going to meet Akamine?

@time=2016-02-14T21:39:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, anyway, what's the objective?
@time=2016-02-14T21:39:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Intelligence? Punching him in the face?
@time=2016-02-14T21:39:58.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, initially Noriko said she wanted to talk but who knows if that's honest
@time=2016-02-14T21:40:09.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I feel like knowing what his plan/part in this would be nice.

@time=2016-02-14T21:42:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let's say it's the day after Noriko fends off the knife-wielding assailant.
@time=2016-02-14T21:42:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I assume Noriko has filled in Emiko and Satori.

@time=2016-02-14T21:58:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko, Emiko, and Satori all make their way down to the nearby riverbank. Akamine is already waiting with a few of his lackeys. He smirks like some kind of terrible villain as they pick their way toward the waterside.
@time=2016-02-14T21:58:48.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko makes a show of looking to each of the lackeys. "No flowers?"
@time=2016-02-14T21:59:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Don't want to make the other girls jealous," Akamine says.
@time=2016-02-14T22:00:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Emiko thinks of Inamura for a second. She sure didn't look like she was getting too much out of Akamine, that's for sure.

@time=2016-02-14T22:03:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Didn't want to waste the good freshmen. Or the good knives."
@time=2016-02-14T22:04:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Akamine drops the grin for a moment. "Looks like I underestimated you."

@time=2016-02-15T00:20:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, we were trying to figure out where she was going earlier like 5 sessions ago.
@time=2016-02-15T00:21:15.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think it's time to try asking the little sisters again?
@time=2016-02-15T00:22:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But the motivation for that was whether Suzuhara was plotting something, no?
@time=2016-02-15T00:22:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :True, but she's just sorta disappeared.
@time=2016-02-15T00:23:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Right, so are the characters still concerned about her?
@time=2016-02-15T00:24:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno. I feel like Noriko would still be a little sore about the words between them, but now maybe she's just disheartened about this whole situation.
@time=2016-02-15T00:25:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Is she just going to be sad for all of the next arc?
@time=2016-02-15T00:26:37.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha, nah, she'll find joy in her flirtations with Takumi.
@time=2016-02-15T00:28:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Are we wrapping this one up, then? Inasmuch as anything's been resolved.
@time=2016-02-15T00:29:02.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think so. Do BGTB2005 or Calica have any threads they want to pull?
@time=2016-02-15T00:29:31.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Not really.  I mean, if she's gone with no leads, she's gone with no leads, and hopefully she won't pull any more shit like what she did
@time=2016-02-15T00:29:42.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :not much, beyond trying to figure out where Suzuhara disappeared to
@time=2016-02-15T00:30:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's no "no leads" but the ones you got kinda find you annoying now.
@time=2016-02-15T00:30:47.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno if we solved any problems here this time around.

@time=2016-02-15T00:33:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway, I think now is as good a time as any to close this arc.
@time=2016-02-15T00:33:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Probably.
@time=2016-02-15T00:34:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We've become social outcasts and pissed off our families. :) A good start to high school.
@time=2016-02-15T00:34:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Why don't we do some reflection fallout, then?
@time=2016-02-15T00:34:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, Satori kinda was already one.
@time=2016-02-15T00:34:32.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And for the other two it's mostly just the gang people.
@time=2016-02-15T00:34:52.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Are there non-gang members in this school?
@time=2016-02-15T00:34:59.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: the student council, probably

@time=2016-02-15T00:37:24.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Any thoughts on reflection fallout?
@time=2016-02-15T00:37:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Last year? I'm pretty sure it's still the same year.

@time=2016-02-15T00:41:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I need more of a sense of how the characters were affected by this.
@time=2016-02-15T00:41:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :True, I had some trouble figuring out good ways to fit them in. And "not everyone needs my help" is super hard to pull in.
