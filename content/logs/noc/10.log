[14-Feb-2016 21:30:16]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | RIGHT NOW: Novus Ordo Conservatorum
[14-Feb-2016 21:30:54]  <IllFlower> Last time we finished with Noriko turning the tables on one of the Highland Boys, quite literally so. Also some classic teenage awkwardness.
[14-Feb-2016 21:31:41]  <IllFlower> How do we want to proceed from here?
[14-Feb-2016 21:32:04]  <IllFlower> I recall some support for taking the fight to Akamine while Suzuhara is busy not being part of the immediate action.
[14-Feb-2016 21:33:01]  <Rig> Yeah, I think having that meeting with Akamine might be a good thing.
[14-Feb-2016 21:33:01]  <Calica> I tihnk there was some teenage awkwardness you threatened to push to this session but can't tell if that was a joke
[14-Feb-2016 21:33:32]  <IllFlower> Well, it was, but maybe Rig feels differently, I dunno. ;)
[14-Feb-2016 21:33:48]  <Rig> I won't be disappointed if we skip it.
[14-Feb-2016 21:35:32]  <IllFlower> lol
[14-Feb-2016 21:36:36]  <IllFlower> All right, then, let's start with fighting. Like we always do.
[14-Feb-2016 21:36:38]  <IllFlower> What's the plan?
[14-Feb-2016 21:37:53]  <Rig> Should we start with the gang going to meet Akamine?
[14-Feb-2016 21:38:46]  <IllFlower> You're a gang now too?
[14-Feb-2016 21:38:57]  <IllFlower> Way to meet him on his level...
[14-Feb-2016 21:38:57]  <Rig> Weren't we always?
[14-Feb-2016 21:39:27]  <IllFlower> >_>
[14-Feb-2016 21:39:35]  <IllFlower> Well, anyway, what's the objective?
[14-Feb-2016 21:39:42]  <IllFlower> Intelligence? Punching him in the face?
[14-Feb-2016 21:39:58]  <Calica> Well, initially Noriko said she wanted to talk but who knows if that's honest
[14-Feb-2016 21:40:09]  <Rig> I feel like knowing what his plan/part in this would be nice.
[14-Feb-2016 21:40:29]  <IllFlower> His part in what?
[14-Feb-2016 21:40:47]  <Calica> Suzuhara's plans, everything with Mayumi, etc.?
[14-Feb-2016 21:40:49]  <Rig> Helping Suzuhara.
[14-Feb-2016 21:41:16]  <IllFlower> Or her helping him, sure.
[14-Feb-2016 21:42:10]  <IllFlower> Let's say it's the day after Noriko fends off the knife-wielding assailant.
[14-Feb-2016 21:42:57]  <Rig> I assume Noriko has filled in Emiko and Satori.
[14-Feb-2016 21:43:15]  <IllFlower> You don't have to assume. She's *your* character. :p
[14-Feb-2016 21:43:28]  <Rig> Then you should have assumed.
[14-Feb-2016 21:44:38]  <IllFlower> Ueno, the Highland Boy in the Conservators' class with the nasty bruises, drops by Noriko's desk on his way in this morning.
[14-Feb-2016 21:44:55]  <IllFlower> "Looks like the man wants a little date with you," he says.
[14-Feb-2016 21:47:13]  <Rig> "Yeah, when?"
[14-Feb-2016 21:48:01]  <IllFlower> "After school, down by the riverbank."

[14-Feb-2016 21:48:55]  <IllFlower> Ueno smirks. "Bring your friends. It'll be more fun that way."
[14-Feb-2016 21:49:14]  <Calica> it'll be more fun having a conflict with all of us
[14-Feb-2016 21:49:17]  <Rig> "He should make sure he has enough flowers for all of us."
[14-Feb-2016 21:50:34]  <IllFlower> "Oh, don't worry. He knows how to treat girls right. Especially in bulk."
[14-Feb-2016 21:51:37]  <IllFlower> Does one of you want to set the upcoming scene?
[14-Feb-2016 21:53:02]  <Calica> no thanks
[14-Feb-2016 21:53:26]  <Rig> I could, I suppose.
[14-Feb-2016 21:53:57]  <IllFlower> Have at it.
[14-Feb-2016 21:58:11]  <Rig> Noriko, Emiko, and Satori all make their way down to the nearby riverbank. Akamine is already waiting with a few of his lackeys. He smirks like some kind of terrible villain as they pick their way toward the waterside.
[14-Feb-2016 21:58:48]  <Rig> Noriko makes a show of looking to each of the lackeys. "No flowers?"
[14-Feb-2016 21:59:25]  <IllFlower> "Don't want to make the other girls jealous," Akamine says.
[14-Feb-2016 22:00:31]  <IllFlower> Emiko thinks of Inamura for a second. She sure didn't look like she was getting too much out of Akamine, that's for sure.
[14-Feb-2016 22:00:47]  <Rig> "Very considerate," Noriko says.
[14-Feb-2016 22:02:14]  <IllFlower> "I didn't make it this far by being an asshole."
[14-Feb-2016 22:02:22]  <IllFlower> Complete lack of self-awareness, this guy has.
[14-Feb-2016 22:02:51]  <Rig> "No, you made it this far by sending scrawny freshman after girls."
[14-Feb-2016 22:03:36]  <Rig> "Did you at least give him the knife yourself or did he have to supply his own?"
[14-Feb-2016 22:03:46]  <IllFlower> "Didn't want to waste the good freshmen. Or the good knives."
[14-Feb-2016 22:04:21]  <IllFlower> Akamine drops the grin for a moment. "Looks like I underestimated you."
[14-Feb-2016 22:06:05]  <Rig> "Why bother with me at all? Did our talk with Suzuhara make you jealous?"
[14-Feb-2016 22:08:33]  <IllFlower> "Maybe it's none of your business.
[14-Feb-2016 22:09:06]  <IllFlower> "You know, I don't like girls like you. Always asking questions, poking around where they don't need to be poking. There are some things you don't need to be curious about."
[14-Feb-2016 22:09:37]  <Rig> "Don't want someone to peel back that thin veneer of a personality?"
[14-Feb-2016 22:10:47]  <IllFlower> "Don't you know a lot of complicated words," Akamine sneers.
[14-Feb-2016 22:11:22]  <Calica> "When someone attacks your friend, you're going to be curious."

[14-Feb-2016 22:13:29]  <Rig> Sounds good.
[14-Feb-2016 22:13:31]  <Calica> f
[14-Feb-2016 22:13:39]  <IllFlower> Stakes?
[14-Feb-2016 22:14:30]  <BGTB2005> punch akamine in the face
[14-Feb-2016 22:14:42]  <Rig> Easy win.
[14-Feb-2016 22:14:51]  <IllFlower> hahahahaha
[14-Feb-2016 22:15:16]  <IllFlower> Maybe something a little more ambitious...
[14-Feb-2016 22:16:03]  <Calica> make him disband the entire gang and stop whatever suzuhara's plan was (that's too ambitious!)
[14-Feb-2016 22:16:08]  <BGTB2005> Neutralise Akamine
[14-Feb-2016 22:16:10]  <IllFlower> I said a little!
[14-Feb-2016 22:16:48]  <IllFlower> It's pretty clear that unless you basically incapacitate Akamine his gang isn't going anywhere for the foreseeable future.
[14-Feb-2016 22:16:57]  <Rig> So, kill Akamine?
[14-Feb-2016 22:17:05]  <IllFlower> >_>
[14-Feb-2016 22:17:08]  <Rig> Kidding.
[14-Feb-2016 22:17:18]  <BGTB2005> imo we should get him arrested
[14-Feb-2016 22:17:29]  <Calica> more seriously, probably get him to give us info on Suzuhara and not kill us
[14-Feb-2016 22:17:35]  <Rig> Sounds reasonable.
[14-Feb-2016 22:17:46]  <IllFlower> So make him tell you what's up with Suzuhara?
[14-Feb-2016 22:17:53]  <IllFlower> What do you want to know?
[14-Feb-2016 22:18:35]  <Calica> what her actual plan is, what he knows about how she's doing it maybe?
[14-Feb-2016 22:19:36]  <IllFlower> Anything more concrete?

[14-Feb-2016 22:23:28]  <Rig> Calica: Do you want to raise first?
[14-Feb-2016 22:23:50]  <Calica> I can, yeah

[14-Feb-2016 23:57:40]  <IllFlower> Okay, done.
[14-Feb-2016 23:57:46]  <IllFlower> Let's move on with this scene, then.
[14-Feb-2016 23:58:13]  <IllFlower> Akamine smirks. "That's more like it.
[14-Feb-2016 23:59:24]  <IllFlower> "I don't have to take anyone on. I just have to keep people like you out."
[15-Feb-2016 00:00:52]  <IllFlower> He looks at Emiko. "Still, though, who would have thought one girl's friends could cause me so much trouble..."
[15-Feb-2016 00:02:52]  <IllFlower> One of the other boys laughs. "You want us to do something about them?"
[15-Feb-2016 00:04:27]  <IllFlower> "Not now," Akamine says, the smile lingering on his face. "Still, funny timing. You show up just as Suzuhara disappears."
[15-Feb-2016 00:05:30]  <BGTB2005> brb, dinner
[15-Feb-2016 00:05:58]  <IllFlower> "Too bad. You're nowhere near as useful to me as she was."
[15-Feb-2016 00:06:23]  <Rig> "Suzuhara is gone?"
[15-Feb-2016 00:06:32]  <IllFlower> We went over this...
[15-Feb-2016 00:07:01]  <Calica> yeah, but disappeared from Akamine too
[15-Feb-2016 00:09:14]  <Rig> Yeah, I assumed she just wasn't showing up to school.
[15-Feb-2016 00:09:21]  <IllFlower> "Yup. Maybe she finally realized she couldn't take the heat." Another laugh.
[15-Feb-2016 00:09:34]  <IllFlower> "Word is that she's transferring or something. I dunno. Not my problem."
[15-Feb-2016 00:09:36]  <Calica> "She seemed at least as...fire-resistant...as you guys."
[15-Feb-2016 00:09:37]  <Rig> I don't remember it being gone from all reality.

[15-Feb-2016 00:17:48]  <Calica> you failed to convince a gang to not beat up takumi
[15-Feb-2016 00:18:01]  <Rig> Failure seems to be a common theme.
[15-Feb-2016 00:18:35]  <IllFlower> you_tried.jpg
[15-Feb-2016 00:19:14]  <Calica> "It sounds like she's completely disappeared, not just from school."
[15-Feb-2016 00:20:13]  <IllFlower> The question is, how much do you care?
[15-Feb-2016 00:20:31]  <Rig> Well, we were trying to figure out where she was going earlier like 5 sessions ago.
[15-Feb-2016 00:21:15]  <BGTB2005> I think it's time to try asking the little sisters again?
[15-Feb-2016 00:22:41]  <IllFlower> But the motivation for that was whether Suzuhara was plotting something, no?
[15-Feb-2016 00:22:53]  <Rig> True, but she's just sorta disappeared.
[15-Feb-2016 00:23:15]  <IllFlower> Right, so are the characters still concerned about her?
[15-Feb-2016 00:24:11]  <Rig> I dunno. I feel like Noriko would still be a little sore about the words between them, but now maybe she's just disheartened about this whole situation.
[15-Feb-2016 00:25:25]  <IllFlower> Is she just going to be sad for all of the next arc?
[15-Feb-2016 00:26:37]  <Rig> Hahaha, nah, she'll find joy in her flirtations with Takumi.
[15-Feb-2016 00:28:42]  <IllFlower> Are we wrapping this one up, then? Inasmuch as anything's been resolved.
[15-Feb-2016 00:29:02]  <Rig> I think so. Do BGTB2005 or Calica have any threads they want to pull?
[15-Feb-2016 00:29:31]  <Calica> Not really.  I mean, if she's gone with no leads, she's gone with no leads, and hopefully she won't pull any more shit like what she did
[15-Feb-2016 00:29:42]  <BGTB2005> not much, beyond trying to figure out where Suzuhara disappeared to
[15-Feb-2016 00:30:37]  <IllFlower> It's no "no leads" but the ones you got kinda find you annoying now.
[15-Feb-2016 00:30:47]  <Rig> I dunno if we solved any problems here this time around.

It was published in English by Vintage Books on July 15, 2008. The story describes the lives of four teenage girls: Toshi, Terauchi, Yuzan (+60 more characters)

[15-Feb-2016 00:33:28]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I think now is as good a time as any to close this arc.
[15-Feb-2016 00:33:36]  <Rig> Probably.
[15-Feb-2016 00:34:03]  <Rig> We've become social outcasts and pissed off our families. :) A good start to high school.
[15-Feb-2016 00:34:03]  <IllFlower> Why don't we do some reflection fallout, then?
[15-Feb-2016 00:34:21]  <IllFlower> Well, Satori kinda was already one.
[15-Feb-2016 00:34:32]  <IllFlower> And for the other two it's mostly just the gang people.
[15-Feb-2016 00:34:52]  <Rig> Are there non-gang members in this school?
[15-Feb-2016 00:34:59]  <Calica> Rig: the student council, probably
[15-Feb-2016 00:35:04]  <Calica> also maybe Emiko's boyfriend?
[15-Feb-2016 00:35:04]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[15-Feb-2016 00:35:52]  <BGTB2005> I think maybe Chiaki, but that would've been last academic year, and I think she was a third year then
[15-Feb-2016 00:37:24]  <Rig> Any thoughts on reflection fallout?
[15-Feb-2016 00:37:28]  <IllFlower> Last year? I'm pretty sure it's still the same year.
[15-Feb-2016 00:38:03]  <IllFlower> Oh, no, it was last year. Wow, it's been a while.

[15-Feb-2016 00:41:25]  <Rig> True, I had some trouble figuring out good ways to fit them in. And "not everyone needs my help" is super hard to pull in.
