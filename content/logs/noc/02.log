@time=2015-11-15T00:21:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: You can raise with one die if that's all that's left.
@time=2015-11-15T00:21:34.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't know if I want to.
@time=2015-11-15T00:22:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Fair enough.
@time=2015-11-15T00:22:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Like, I could definitely take the blow, but that just seems kinda silly.
@time=2015-11-15T00:22:52.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What do you think?

@time=2015-11-15T00:24:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah. I was going to say that taking the blow didn't have to affect the strength of her see, but if that's what you think is the right action, then giving makes sense to me.
@time=2015-11-15T00:26:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko looks down at her desk. "Okay then," she says. "I'm going to head home. Good luck with the festival." Noriko gathers up her things and makes her way to the door. Takumi is already back to work, ignoring any hurt he may have caused.
@time=2015-11-15T00:26:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Roll 3d4 fallout, then.
@time=2015-11-15T00:26:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How about "Not everyone needs my help" for the 1d6?
@time=2015-11-15T00:27:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :@dice roll 3d4
@time=2015-11-15T00:27:04.000Z :Omnipresence PRIVMSG #madokamadness :14Rig: Rolled 3 3 3 = 9.
@time=2015-11-15T00:27:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sure.
@time=2015-11-15T00:27:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :6, so that's short-term fallout.
@time=2015-11-15T00:27:34.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think I'll knock Takumi's dice down for a session.
@time=2015-11-15T00:27:52.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Actually, I could just leave the scene.
@time=2015-11-15T00:27:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness ::P
@time=2015-11-15T00:27:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :To d4?
@time=2015-11-15T00:28:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :lol, that's not cheap at all.
@time=2015-11-15T00:28:34.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, unless Takumi comes up in the next conflict it won't matter either.
@time=2015-11-15T00:28:59.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm good with making that relationship a d4 temporarily too.
@time=2015-11-15T00:29:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That's true, but he might. :p
@time=2015-11-15T00:29:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, d4 it is.
@time=2015-11-15T00:30:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Great. We're done with initiations!
