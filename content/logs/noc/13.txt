[19-Mar-2016 20:04:57]  <IllFlower> And off we go.
[19-Mar-2016 20:05:10]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | RIGHT NOW: Novus Ordo Conservatorum
[19-Mar-2016 20:05:37]  <IllFlower> Last time, our heroes went over to the next ward to help a colleague in a spot of trouble.
[19-Mar-2016 20:05:48]  <IllFlower> Or several burning apartments' worth.
[19-Mar-2016 20:07:11]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[19-Mar-2016 20:08:20]  <IllFlower> Minako guides the Conservators over to a low-rise housing complex. It doesn't look like it's in the greatest of states, especially given the black scar across one building around the third floor.
[19-Mar-2016 20:09:15]  <IllFlower> There's a substantial amount of caution tape blocking off the corridor. A couple of police officers are going over the scene.
[19-Mar-2016 20:10:11]  <IllFlower> Another one is interviewing a young mother down in front of the building.
[19-Mar-2016 20:10:58]  <Rig> Noriko takes in the scene, thinking about how Suzuhara could be the one behind all this.
[19-Mar-2016 20:11:34]  <IllFlower> "The witch possessed a man," Minako says. "Tsukumo was trying to stop him on that balcony when he got hurt."
[19-Mar-2016 20:13:17]  <IllFlower> Looking at the extent of the damage, it seems a miracle that Tsukumo got away with the relatively superficial burns he did.
[19-Mar-2016 20:13:59]  <Rig> "The fire started after he tried to stop him?"
[19-Mar-2016 20:15:10]  <IllFlower> "No, he'd already set the fire, but Tsukumo's a water mage, so he thought... yeah."
[19-Mar-2016 20:16:47]  <IllFlower> Minako frowns. "It didn't go quite the way we'd expected."
[19-Mar-2016 20:17:42]  <Rig> Noriko nods. "It looks like there was a lot of fire. I don't think Suzuhara was ever so explicit." Noriko looks to Emiko for her thoughts.
[19-Mar-2016 20:19:48]  <Calica> "She wasn't, but if she's got witches following her, she may not have that much control."
[19-Mar-2016 20:21:41]  <IllFlower> The police officer who was conducting an interview walks up to the girls. "Sorry, can I help you?" she asks.
[19-Mar-2016 20:23:04]  <Rig> Noriko smiles politely. "We were just curious about what had happened."
[19-Mar-2016 20:23:06]  <IllFlower> The badge on her uniform reads "Sachi Inamura."
[19-Mar-2016 20:23:49]  <IllFlower> "There was a fire here," Inamura says, restating the obvious. "We think it was set deliberately."
[19-Mar-2016 20:24:41]  <Calica> "It looks quite bad.  Were there any injuries?"
[19-Mar-2016 20:25:45]  <IllFlower> "Not that we know of. We got lucky. It happened in the middle of the day, so most of the apartments' occupants weren't home."
[19-Mar-2016 20:29:53]  <Rig> "Do you know who lived there?" Noriko asks, pretty certain the officer has to be getting tired of the questions.
[19-Mar-2016 20:30:44]  <IllFlower> "I can't talk about that. We have a pretty good idea of who the intended target was, though."
[19-Mar-2016 20:32:29]  <Calica> Emiko looks at Minako, wondering if she knows who the intended target was
[19-Mar-2016 20:33:45]  <IllFlower> Another officer, Katsumi Higashiyama from the nameplate, walks up to Inamura and taps her on the shoulder. "We found this inside the place."
[19-Mar-2016 20:34:26]  <IllFlower> Higashiyama holds up a charred index card with a hand-drawn map and a partially-readable series of numbers that looks like half of a date and time.
[19-Mar-2016 20:35:30]  <IllFlower> "That's the apartment, all right," Inamura says. "Can you put that into evidence?"
[19-Mar-2016 20:36:20]  <IllFlower> Higashiyama nods obligingly and begins to walk back towards the crime scene.
[19-Mar-2016 20:36:33]  <Rig> Were that date and time recent?
[19-Mar-2016 20:36:36]  <Rig> *the
[19-Mar-2016 20:36:50]  <Calica> Can we even tell?
[19-Mar-2016 20:37:21]  <IllFlower> If Noriko's reading it right, it looks like earlier today.
[19-Mar-2016 20:38:23]  <Rig> So, maybe some kind of map to the apartment and a time to go and set the fire?
[19-Mar-2016 20:40:00]  <IllFlower> Seems like it.
[19-Mar-2016 20:40:39]  <IllFlower> It looks like the Conservators won't get much more information unless they inspect the room themselves, but with the police there that'll be a challenge.
[19-Mar-2016 20:41:03]  <Calica> is IllFlower suggesting we become outlaws?
[19-Mar-2016 20:41:14]  <Rig> He generally does.
[19-Mar-2016 20:41:33]  <IllFlower> Me? Never.
[19-Mar-2016 20:41:38]  <Rig> Perhaps we should just excuse ourselves from the police and see if there is anything interesting nearby?
[19-Mar-2016 20:41:48]  <Rig> Or maybe wait for them to leave and then search the room?
[19-Mar-2016 20:43:27]  <IllFlower> Your call.
[19-Mar-2016 20:44:07]  <Rig> Calica, BGTB2005?
[19-Mar-2016 20:44:41]  <BGTB2005> is there any real reason we can't do both?
[19-Mar-2016 20:45:07]  <Calica> yeah, seems like we could try to see if anything interesting nearby first, then try to search the room tonight or something
[19-Mar-2016 20:45:19]  <Calica> assuming the police aren't keeping 24-hour watch
[19-Mar-2016 20:46:40]  <IllFlower> Probably not. What would the purpose be of returning to the scene of this crime?
[19-Mar-2016 20:48:29]  <IllFlower> Unless the arsonist wants to come back and appreciate his handiwork.
[19-Mar-2016 20:48:50]  <Rig> Never doubt a narcissist arsonist. 
[19-Mar-2016 20:49:08]  <IllFlower> Would make a good song title, "Narcissist Arsonist."
[19-Mar-2016 20:50:50]  <Rig> It'd be a showstopper. It'd burn down the venue.
[19-Mar-2016 20:51:27]  <Rig> So, plan is to do a lap around the housing complex and see if there is anything interesting and then head back to the crime scene?
[19-Mar-2016 20:52:04]  *** AttObl <~AttObl@2602:306:ccc6:8ea0:2903:bf0d:c754:9bf6> has quit IRC (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.92 [Firefox 44.0.2/20160210153822])
[19-Mar-2016 20:53:18]  <IllFlower> The Conservators leave Inamura to her work and head around to the other side of the block.
[19-Mar-2016 20:54:47]  <IllFlower> "The witch probably left traces of its presence at the scene," Minako says, "but they'll be gone soon if--"
[19-Mar-2016 20:55:52]  <IllFlower> A buzzing sound interrupts the conversation. Minako reaches into her pocket for her phone, but it's still as a painting.
[19-Mar-2016 20:56:31]  <Rig> It turns out that Satori is ascending to heaven suddenly and the buzzing noise is her.
[19-Mar-2016 20:56:45]  <Calica> her name does mean enlightenment iirc
[19-Mar-2016 20:56:53]  <BGTB2005> pff
[19-Mar-2016 20:56:54]  <IllFlower> Minako scans her surroundings. "It sounds like it's coming from underneath those bushes..."
[19-Mar-2016 20:58:26]  <Rig> Noriko moves toward the bushes cautiously, almost expecting it to be angry insects.
[19-Mar-2016 20:59:05]  <IllFlower> Angry insects that make a very regular pulsating noise.
[19-Mar-2016 20:59:18]  <Calica> angry cell phones
[19-Mar-2016 21:00:03]  <IllFlower> Feeling around underneath the foliage, Noriko fishes out a very scuffed-looking black flip phone.
[19-Mar-2016 21:00:11]  <Rig> "Should I answer it?"
[19-Mar-2016 21:00:32]  <Calica> "Might as well, I think."
[19-Mar-2016 21:00:46]  <Rig> Noriko flips open the phone. "Hello?"
[19-Mar-2016 21:00:55]  <IllFlower> The name on the incoming call is "Yamada."
[19-Mar-2016 21:01:36]  <IllFlower> "He--" Yamada stops short. "Who is this?"
[19-Mar-2016 21:02:38]  <Calica> Emiko tries to remember if she knows any Yamadas.  (Was she able to see this?)
[19-Mar-2016 21:02:56]  <Rig> Let's assume Noriko said who it was.
[19-Mar-2016 21:03:12]  <IllFlower> Probably. But there are a million Yamadas in this city alone.
[19-Mar-2016 21:03:40]  <BGTB2005> probably at least a dozen at school
[19-Mar-2016 21:03:49]  <Rig> "I, uh, found this phone. Do you know who it belongs to?" Noriko asks.
[19-Mar-2016 21:05:41]  <IllFlower> Yamada clears his throat. "Yes. Can you turn it in at a police box? I'll tell its owner where to retrieve it."
[19-Mar-2016 21:07:51]  <Rig> Noriko covers the mouthpiece and relays the call to the group.
[19-Mar-2016 21:08:20]  <Rig> "Should we?"
[19-Mar-2016 21:09:11]  <Calica> "Probably, but on the other hand, this close to the scene of the crime..."
[19-Mar-2016 21:10:22]  <Rig> "What should I say? Should I ask him about the owner?"
[19-Mar-2016 21:10:55]  <Calica> "Worth a shot."
[19-Mar-2016 21:13:04]  <Rig> "Do you know where the owner is? It looks like the police are searching for him." Noriko says, trying to be imperative on the phone.
[19-Mar-2016 21:13:42]  <IllFlower> "I can't talk about that," Yamada says, unintentially echoing the exact phrasing of Officer Inamura just moments ago.
[19-Mar-2016 21:15:30]  <Rig> Noriko shakes her head. "I'll drop the phone at a police box then."
[19-Mar-2016 21:16:44]  <IllFlower> "Thanks." Then a click as Yamada hangs up.
[19-Mar-2016 21:18:06]  <Rig> "That wasn't at all helpful," Noriko says. She looks down at the flip phone and starts trying to find pictures or anything identifying.
[19-Mar-2016 21:19:39]  <IllFlower> The information on the phone is completely barebones. There are only two numbers in the contacts, Yamada and someone named "Lerna." A foreign woman? Weird.
[19-Mar-2016 21:20:38]  <IllFlower> There are a few blurry shots of people, all invariably young, male, and seen from a distance.
[19-Mar-2016 21:20:47]  <Calica> call Lerna?  no way that could possibly go wrong
[19-Mar-2016 21:20:50]  <IllFlower> Well, it's not exactly a cutting-edge camera.
[19-Mar-2016 21:21:10]  <Rig> "There isn't anything useful on this. Seems like a burner phone."
[19-Mar-2016 21:21:28]  * Rig nudges everyone and raises his eyebrows
[19-Mar-2016 21:21:55]  <IllFlower> boooo get off the stage
[19-Mar-2016 21:22:30]  <Rig> "Maybe we could call this other person? Lerna?" Noriko says. She holds the phone out to Emiko.
[19-Mar-2016 21:22:58]  <Calica> "Might be worth a shot.  Especially if it's a burner, who knows who they'll actually send to pick it up"
[19-Mar-2016 21:24:05]  <Calica> are you suggesting Emiko make the call?
[19-Mar-2016 21:24:10]  <Rig> She is the charm offensive.
[19-Mar-2016 21:24:19]  <IllFlower> Minako looks skeptically at Noriko. "I don't know if calling random people on a suspicious phone is a great idea..."
[19-Mar-2016 21:24:35]  <Rig> "How do you feel about sneaking into a crime scene then?"
[19-Mar-2016 21:25:55]  <IllFlower> Minako sighs. "Okay, okay, I guess you have a point."
[19-Mar-2016 21:26:33]  <Calica> Emiko picks up the phone from Noriko and presses the buttons to make a call.
[19-Mar-2016 21:29:11]  <IllFlower> After several rings, a woman picks up the phone. "What's the story?"
[19-Mar-2016 21:29:19]  <IllFlower> First time Emiko's ever heard that greeting, certainly.
[19-Mar-2016 21:29:33]  <Calica> gratuitous english, I assume :p
[19-Mar-2016 21:30:38]  <Calica> "Hello, my friends and I found this phone in the bushes and we're trying to figure out who it belongs to."
[19-Mar-2016 21:31:48]  <Rig> A good story.
[19-Mar-2016 21:32:10]  <IllFlower> "Sanada's alive?" a male voice in the background says before the call goes dead.
[19-Mar-2016 21:32:24]  <IllFlower> It lasted approximately ten seconds.
[19-Mar-2016 21:32:29]  <Rig> Very talkative people.
[19-Mar-2016 21:32:33]  <Calica> clearly
[19-Mar-2016 21:34:15]  <Rig> I don't believe we know a Sanada.
[19-Mar-2016 21:34:31]  <Calica> it's just above the Snited Utates
[19-Mar-2016 21:35:14]  <IllFlower> Everyone's a stranger.
[19-Mar-2016 21:35:44]  <Rig> We're in a strange land.
[19-Mar-2016 21:35:45]  <IllFlower> Well, we have an incredibly suspicious phone and some police officers in the vicinity. What do?
[19-Mar-2016 21:36:03]  <Rig> Let's pass it off to the police.
[19-Mar-2016 21:36:29]  <Rig> Without drawing suspicion to ourselves hopefully.
[19-Mar-2016 21:38:07]  <Calica> yeah, that seems about all that phone is going to lead us to
[19-Mar-2016 21:39:42]  <IllFlower> Meanwhile, Rin watches the news coverage on television with envy.
[19-Mar-2016 21:39:54]  <Rig> :P
[19-Mar-2016 21:40:12]  <Calica> as if Rin isn't secretly the perpetrator
[19-Mar-2016 21:40:18]  <IllFlower> Inamura is still there when the Conservators return, flipping through some papers on a clipboard.
[19-Mar-2016 21:41:10]  <Rig> It's a tough job, but someone has to do it.
[19-Mar-2016 21:41:37]  <Rig> Emiko has the phone still right? She should probably hand it over.
[19-Mar-2016 21:42:41]  <Calica> yeah
[19-Mar-2016 21:42:49]  <IllFlower> To Satori, right?
[19-Mar-2016 21:42:55]  <Calica> obviously :p
[19-Mar-2016 21:43:21]  <Calica> should just hand it to her and then push her in front to the cop
[19-Mar-2016 21:45:14]  <IllFlower> Well, something's gotta happen.
[19-Mar-2016 21:45:50]  <Calica> Emiko hands the phone over to Satori.  She's been quiet. (:p)
[19-Mar-2016 21:46:15]  <BGTB2005> Satori looks at the phone, then at Emiko
[19-Mar-2016 21:46:32]  <Calica> Emiko subtly nudges Satori towards Inamura
[19-Mar-2016 21:47:04]  <IllFlower> Minako looks at Emiko, then at Satori. This group has an odd dynamic...
[19-Mar-2016 21:47:13]  <IllFlower> Oh, well, it's not any of her business. Yet.
[19-Mar-2016 21:47:22]  <Calica> just trying to get Satori to do something :p
[19-Mar-2016 21:49:02]  <IllFlower> Inamura glances up and sees Satori standing there mutely with the phone.
[19-Mar-2016 21:50:54]  <Rig> Soon we'll start an idol group. Satori can be the shy one.
[19-Mar-2016 21:51:46]  <BGTB2005> Satori hands the phone over to Inamura, mumbling "Lost phone."
[19-Mar-2016 21:52:21]  <IllFlower> "Where did you find this?" the officer asks.
[19-Mar-2016 21:54:50]  <BGTB2005> "Um... Under a bush."
[19-Mar-2016 21:55:35]  <IllFlower> Satori points back at where Noriko recovered the phone, which just so happens to be the same direction where the other three girls are standing.
[19-Mar-2016 21:56:28]  <IllFlower> "I see." Inamura takes the phone and looks it over. "Thanks."
[19-Mar-2016 21:56:54]  <Rig> Totally unsuspicious.
[19-Mar-2016 21:57:20]  <Calica> (in It's Always Sunny font, "The Conservators Get Arrested")
[19-Mar-2016 21:57:51]  <IllFlower> Dennis Reynolds suddenly shows up and tries to hit on Inamura.
[19-Mar-2016 21:57:59]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[19-Mar-2016 21:59:01]  <IllFlower> Inamura says into her walkie-talkie, "Civilian recovered the phone. Must have dropped it or something."
[19-Mar-2016 21:59:53]  <IllFlower> "Okay, thanks," says another officer. "We have contact with the owner, so you can put that one in evidence."
[19-Mar-2016 22:00:11]  <Rig> These police are weird.
[19-Mar-2016 22:01:30]  <Calica> hey, at least they're not the police from my Sorcerer campaign, who straight-up sell evidence
[19-Mar-2016 22:01:50]  <IllFlower> I'm sorry I'm not Dick Wolf.
[19-Mar-2016 22:01:59]  <IllFlower> Well, maybe not. I don't really want to be named Dick Wolf.
[19-Mar-2016 22:02:13]  <Rig> Richie Wolf.
[19-Mar-2016 22:03:19]  <Rig> "That was kind of a waste of time," Noriko says, mostly to herself.
[19-Mar-2016 22:03:55]  <IllFlower> What's weird? I mean, I know it's weird, but what?
[19-Mar-2016 22:04:06]  <Calica> "Well, if the police are doing their job, it kind of makes it hard for us to do ours"
[19-Mar-2016 22:04:20]  <IllFlower> Gotta know whether it's the intended kind of weird or not.
[19-Mar-2016 22:04:49]  <Rig> I guess the police don't seem like police. Like, they seem more like they're looking for something they really want to find.
[19-Mar-2016 22:05:13]  <IllFlower> Like they already know something's up?
[19-Mar-2016 22:05:16]  <Rig> Yeah.
[19-Mar-2016 22:05:23]  <IllFlower> Oh, that's intentional.
[19-Mar-2016 22:05:29]  <Rig> I figured.
[19-Mar-2016 22:06:00]  <Rig> I don't know if Noriko would notice that though. Like, her interactions with police are probably limited.
[19-Mar-2016 22:06:06]  <Rig> After all, she's never met Rin.
[19-Mar-2016 22:06:14]  <IllFlower> Maybe she has a dark past. Who knows.
[19-Mar-2016 22:06:28]  <IllFlower> Twelve-year-old Noriko was smashing windows and stealing jewelry.
[19-Mar-2016 22:06:59]  <Rig> Well, considering the kind of people at her high school maybe it was a neighborhood sport.
[19-Mar-2016 22:07:05]  <IllFlower> Ouch.
[19-Mar-2016 22:07:40]  <Rig> Should we have one of the character's be concerned about the police behavior?
[19-Mar-2016 22:09:05]  <Calica> maybe Minako was a delinquent before becoming a Conservator
[19-Mar-2016 22:09:37]  *** Xeniera is now known as showerstace
[19-Mar-2016 22:09:39]  <Rig> "How long do you think they'll be around for? They said they already had some leads right?"
[19-Mar-2016 22:11:18]  <IllFlower> "We should go back to the precinct," says Higashiyama, over the radio. "We're hitting diminishing returns on physical evidence, fast."
[19-Mar-2016 22:12:01]  <Rig> They have charts in the office for evidence drop rates on crime scene raids.
[19-Mar-2016 22:13:52]  <Calica> Are we going to rush in as they exit?
[19-Mar-2016 22:14:26]  <Rig> Just walk right in as they walk out?
[19-Mar-2016 22:14:38]  <Rig> We should probably be a little more subtle.
[19-Mar-2016 22:15:14]  <Calica> yeah, probably, I just found that an amusing mental image
[19-Mar-2016 22:17:52]  <Rig> Noriko watches as the police wrap up their investigation, wondering if she should try to talk to Minako about her team and if she's worried about them.
[19-Mar-2016 22:18:35]  *** showerstace <~xeniera@usc-secure-wireless-088-100.usc.edu> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
[19-Mar-2016 22:19:59]  <Rig> "Are police usually involved in your witch hunts?" she says, failing miserably at striking up a conversation with her temporary team member.
[19-Mar-2016 22:24:24]  <IllFlower> Sorry, had to run out for a bit.
[19-Mar-2016 22:25:13]  <IllFlower> "Not really. It's something you try to avoid when your ranks consist mostly of high school girls."
[19-Mar-2016 22:25:48]  <Calica> "This is worrying.  Especially if it's Suzuhara..."
[19-Mar-2016 22:26:39]  <IllFlower> "I don't know. Something tells me that if she's involved, it's more than just her."
[19-Mar-2016 22:26:52]  <Rig> "That's also worrying."
[19-Mar-2016 22:27:58]  <IllFlower> "You have a point," Minako says.
[19-Mar-2016 22:29:27]  <Rig> "But we can't let a coven start up, especially with someone like Suzuhara involved. That drive for revenge is a bad mix for magic."
[19-Mar-2016 22:30:02]  <IllFlower> After whiling away the time in a fast food joint for about an hour, watching the sun descend behind the endless cityscape, the girls return to the apartment complex. True to their expectations, the police are gone. The only sign of their presence is the caution tape and a large car battery-powered floodlight aimed at the entrance of the apartment at the center of the fire.
[19-Mar-2016 22:31:15]  <IllFlower> "Shall we go?" Minako asks, standing at the bottom of the staircase.
[19-Mar-2016 22:31:21]  <Calica> "Let's go."
[19-Mar-2016 22:34:00]  <IllFlower> Slipping through the reams of tape, the girls make their way up.
[19-Mar-2016 22:35:05]  <IllFlower> Though the door is covered by the floodlight, it doesn't look like the interior is illuminated at all. They must not have needed light inside while the sun was still up. The floodlight is probably just a deterrent.
[19-Mar-2016 22:35:21]  <IllFlower> So much for that, I guess.
[19-Mar-2016 22:35:51]  <IllFlower> Someone else can chip in on the description of the apartment.
[19-Mar-2016 22:36:42]  <Rig> Noriko holds up her phone, using the screen as a light as she stares into the charred mess in the apartment.
[19-Mar-2016 22:36:55]  <IllFlower> Most of the interior is pretty thoroughly burned. It's hard to tell what the layout of the place used to be.
[19-Mar-2016 22:37:34]  <Calica> "I see how the police weren't able to get much out of this.  Noriko, do you sense anything?"
[19-Mar-2016 22:37:37]  <Rig> Noriko spends a moment trying to identify a strange puddle on the floor before realizing it's a hanging light.
[19-Mar-2016 22:37:56]  <IllFlower> There's a slight smell of stale water, probably from the automatic sprinklers going off. Doesn't look like they were on for long, though.
[19-Mar-2016 22:38:35]  <Rig> "One moment," Noriko says, closing her eyes. She reaches out into the magic around her.
[19-Mar-2016 22:39:16]  <Rig> It seems mostly like a conflicting mess of emotions and energy scattered across the burned out husk.
[19-Mar-2016 22:39:35]  <IllFlower> A soft blue glow emanates from Noriko's body as she tries to trace what happened.
[19-Mar-2016 22:40:23]  <IllFlower> Into the dim light steps an unfamiliar human silhouette. Emiko quickly pulls out her phone and spotlights the interloper.
[19-Mar-2016 22:40:30]  <BGTB2005> a conflicting mess of emotions and energy <-- totally Rin's fault
[19-Mar-2016 22:40:50]  <Calica> BGTB2005: watch out, Rin's going to end up being one of Suzuhara's cult followers
[19-Mar-2016 22:41:07]  <IllFlower> "I had a feeling something was up with you girls," Officer Higashiyama says.
[19-Mar-2016 22:41:29]  <Calica> duh duh DUH
[19-Mar-2016 22:41:33]  <Calica> *dun dun DUN
[19-Mar-2016 22:41:50]  <IllFlower> Her face is stony, even a little disdainful.
[19-Mar-2016 22:41:54]  <Rig> Noriko is quickly becoming quite a delinquent. 
[19-Mar-2016 22:42:40]  <Calica> before you know it she'll be scrapping with Akamine
[19-Mar-2016 22:43:19]  <IllFlower> "There's really only one reason I can think of that a group of high schoolers would have an interest in a crime scene."
[19-Mar-2016 22:43:40]  <Calica> uh oh
[19-Mar-2016 22:44:39]  <IllFlower> Someone say something funny, at least.
[19-Mar-2016 22:44:39]  <Rig> Tagging the place.
[19-Mar-2016 22:44:39]  <Calica> trying to think of if there's anything Emiko can say that will get her out of this.  maybe just flash her winning smile
[19-Mar-2016 22:44:50]  <BGTB2005> worth a shot
[19-Mar-2016 22:44:59]  <Rig> "We're thinking of pursuing a career in law enforcement."
[19-Mar-2016 22:45:05]  <BGTB2005> maybe offer tea and cookies too
[19-Mar-2016 22:45:08]  <IllFlower> ahahaha
[19-Mar-2016 22:45:10]  <Calica> Emiko flashes her smile, sheepishly, racing for something to say that won't just drag her deepe--okay, never mind that.
[19-Mar-2016 22:47:53]  <IllFlower> "Seems like it. After all, only an investigator would be trying to perform a Detego spell."
[19-Mar-2016 22:48:39]  <IllFlower> Higashiyama looks sternly at Noriko. "You have to go. Now."
[19-Mar-2016 22:49:11]  <Calica> Emiko whispers to Noriko.  "How many police officers are familiar with Detego?"
[19-Mar-2016 22:49:17]  <Rig> Noriko frowns, tense. She's only met a few older members of the Order and they always set her on edge.
[19-Mar-2016 22:49:28]  <Rig> "Not many,"
[19-Mar-2016 22:49:54]  <IllFlower> Not many, indeed.
[19-Mar-2016 22:49:57]  <Rig> "Who are you?" Noriko asks Higashiyama.
[19-Mar-2016 22:51:46]  <IllFlower> "Officer Katsumi Higashiyama, Matsuhama Ward Precinct, Metropolitan Police. And someone with a passing familiarity with your kind."
[19-Mar-2016 22:53:06]  <Calica> "Seems more than passing, really."
[19-Mar-2016 22:53:59]  <BGTB2005> she probably had to deal with the school baseball diamond
[19-Mar-2016 22:54:04]  <BGTB2005> and the hospital
[19-Mar-2016 22:54:13]  <Calica> is this the same city?
[19-Mar-2016 22:54:18]  <BGTB2005> and the diner
[19-Mar-2016 22:54:51]  <Calica> maybe Yuna's house
[19-Mar-2016 22:54:54]  <IllFlower> "My cousin Yurika's a member of your Order. She taught me some spell identification. Never thought it would come in useful."
[19-Mar-2016 22:55:47]  *** Xeniera <~xeniera@usc-secure-wireless-088-100.usc.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[19-Mar-2016 22:55:48]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Xeniera
[19-Mar-2016 22:55:51]  <Rig> "If you know what we are then you probably know why we're here and why we can't just leave."
[19-Mar-2016 22:56:42]  <IllFlower> "And if you know anything about how we operate, we aren't particularly fond of people walking in and messing with things."
[19-Mar-2016 22:58:35]  <IllFlower> s/we aren't/you know why we aren't/
[19-Mar-2016 22:58:48]  <Rig> Trying to remember which police officer is which again.
[19-Mar-2016 22:59:02]  <Calica> she's the second one, the one we didn't hand the phone to.
[19-Mar-2016 22:59:21]  <Rig> The one that found the card, yeah?
[19-Mar-2016 22:59:24]  <Calica> "That phone we handed you...did you find the owner yet?"
[19-Mar-2016 22:59:26]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[19-Mar-2016 23:00:33]  <IllFlower> "Oh, we know. He won't be needing it, though. He'll just get a new one."
[19-Mar-2016 23:00:59]  <Rig> "He was the target then?"
[19-Mar-2016 23:02:20]  <IllFlower> "Of course. He's always been the target."
[19-Mar-2016 23:03:07]  <Rig> "And who is targeting him?"
[19-Mar-2016 23:04:04]  <IllFlower> "We know that too. Unfortunately, most of the evidence is cinders and ashes by the time we get to it."
[19-Mar-2016 23:04:41]  <Rig> That isn't an answer to Noriko's question. That's just being a dick.
[19-Mar-2016 23:04:55]  <Calica> "Maybe you should let us help, then.  We can't unburn, but I'm sure you already know we can pull out evidence you can't."
[19-Mar-2016 23:05:56]  <IllFlower> "So we can put the suspects in front of a magical tribunal? What good is that going to do us?"
[19-Mar-2016 23:07:23]  <IllFlower> Rig: I mean, better to be a dick than to accidentally spill the details of an ongoing investigation.
[19-Mar-2016 23:08:09]  <Rig> "Do you think you can solve this problem? I mean, this room was set on fire by a person willing it to be on fire. They didn't need a match. Why do you think you can stop them with some handcuffs and some bars."
[19-Mar-2016 23:09:13]  <IllFlower> "No. The nice thing is, though, I don't need to."
[19-Mar-2016 23:09:27]  <Calica> "And why don't you need to?"
[19-Mar-2016 23:10:16]  <IllFlower> Higashiyama is silent for a moment. "There's an organization behind me," she says.
[19-Mar-2016 23:10:31]  <Rig> No, there's a door.
[19-Mar-2016 23:10:42]  <IllFlower> "I'm going to ask, one more time, for you to leave."
[19-Mar-2016 23:11:13]  <Rig> Should we leave?
[19-Mar-2016 23:11:58]  <Rig> Minako's teammate/friend got hurt here. If we leave we lose a chance of tracking anything down from this scene. But if we stay we might have a fight on our hands.
[19-Mar-2016 23:12:58]  <Calica> A talking conflict might be worth it but we might have already passed that point
[19-Mar-2016 23:13:21]  <Rig> The one more time implied that there is some force she's willing to exert.
[19-Mar-2016 23:14:17]  <Rig> We could certainly open a conflict at talking and see if she just escalates right away.
[19-Mar-2016 23:14:47]  <Rig> I feel like Minako wouldn't be leaving this scene, but I don't know about her really.
[19-Mar-2016 23:15:16]  <Rig> Noriko is reluctant to leave because Suzuhara could be involved and she feels responsible for any harm that she causes.
[19-Mar-2016 23:15:28]  <IllFlower> Minako's not going anywhere unless forced to.
[19-Mar-2016 23:15:49]  <Rig> I'm good with holding our ground then. Should we do that as a conflict or just a simple "No"
[19-Mar-2016 23:17:05]  <IllFlower> Conflict, because she's clearly not going to just go for "no."
[19-Mar-2016 23:17:47]  <Rig> Cool. Well, Noriko can tell she's not going to go for talking but would like to hold out hope for that. Do we start at talking?
[19-Mar-2016 23:18:00]  <Rig> Also, stakes being that the team stays in the apartment to investigate.
[19-Mar-2016 23:18:21]  <IllFlower> Talking.
[19-Mar-2016 23:19:18]  <Rig> Okay. Do we want to start this now? My girlfriend is supposed to be bringing dinner home soon.
[19-Mar-2016 23:19:39]  <IllFlower> We can roll over to next session.
[19-Mar-2016 23:19:51]  <Rig> Okay. Sorry we didn't get very far in this session.
[19-Mar-2016 23:20:21]  <Rig> I am excited to see how you're playing out the Territorial Forces or whatever they're called in the manual.
[19-Mar-2016 23:20:27]  <IllFlower> No, I think we did pretty well. Even if it's all unclear what it means so far.
[19-Mar-2016 23:20:30]  <Calica> territorial authority
[19-Mar-2016 23:20:31]  <Rig> I assume that's what you're pulling from.
[19-Mar-2016 23:20:46]  <IllFlower> Sorta, yeah.
[19-Mar-2016 23:20:54]  <Rig> I'm excited about it. It's an interesting twist.
[19-Mar-2016 23:21:09]  <Rig> I was thinking the cop was an apostate at first, but this is different.
[19-Mar-2016 23:21:13]  <IllFlower> We'll pick up again next week, then. Thanks for playing, as always.
[19-Mar-2016 23:21:20]  <IllFlower> Rig: It's never that simple. :p
[19-Mar-2016 23:21:21]  <Rig> Thanks for running the game.
[19-Mar-2016 23:21:30]  <Calica> Yes, thanks for running.
[19-Mar-2016 23:21:35]  <Rig> I'm excited to see what we get up to next week. I've really been thrilled with the past couple sessions.
[19-Mar-2016 23:21:39]  <Rig> This arc is a lot of fun.
[19-Mar-2016 23:21:40]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | NOVUS ORDO CONSERVATORUM: Sat 4/1p
[19-Mar-2016 23:21:45]  <IllFlower> Glad to hear it.
[19-Mar-2016 23:22:19]  <IllFlower> Just wait until I anticlimactically mess up the ending!
[19-Mar-2016 23:22:46]  <Rig> It'll be fun. We'll all be like "Wait... huh?"
