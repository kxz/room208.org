@time=2015-12-20T00:09:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :What's the plan now?
@time=2015-12-20T00:09:43.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I think we now have to find a way to find out who did this

@time=2015-12-20T00:13:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, yes. 
@time=2015-12-20T00:13:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :How would our characters approach them. I feel like they'd be totally dismissive of Noriko.
@time=2015-12-20T00:13:57.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She's too young establishment.

@time=2015-12-20T00:18:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :After school, it's hard to miss the small throng of girls hanging on to Akamine as he leaves the building. It would be kind of amusing if it weren't so disheartening.
@time=2015-12-20T00:19:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko clicks her tongue. The sight seems to have validated a thought in her mind about most people her age, and it's not a nice one.

@time=2015-12-20T00:26:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There's clearly a pecking order. Inamura's kind of out on the fringes. Must be because she's only a first-year and hasn't had enough time to ingratiate herself to Akamine -- or assert her status over the others.
@time=2015-12-20T00:27:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Would she even be useful to talk to?

@time=2015-12-20T03:03:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, previous levels of subtlety for this supercontinuity have been to run in, magical guns blazing, and shout denunciations all around.
@time=2015-12-20T03:04:13.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I like it.
@time=2015-12-20T03:04:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There have been previous attempts at subterfuge.
@time=2015-12-20T03:05:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Attempts.
@time=2015-12-20T03:05:12.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Suzuhara, we were putting together a get well card for Mayumi. Someone told us you were close with her and we wanted to know if you'd like to sign it."
@time=2015-12-20T03:05:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Is that so?"
@time=2015-12-20T03:05:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko doesn't really know how to respond to a question to her question. She just sorta nods.
@time=2015-12-20T03:06:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Suzuhara's rather tall, and the effect of her looking down at Noriko isn't a particularly pleasant one.
@time=2015-12-20T03:07:04.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Are you implying it's not so?"
@time=2015-12-20T03:07:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm afraid I don't know Rokujou all that well. Are you sure it'd be okay for me to sign it? I'd hate to be an intruder."
@time=2015-12-20T03:08:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She says all these thoughtful words, but her tone of voice is that script again. Underinflected and hollow.
@time=2015-12-20T03:08:40.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Oh, I'm sorry to have bothered you. You did hear about what happened, didn't you?" (I would assume there would be some gossip about an exploding letter.)
@time=2015-12-20T03:09:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Yes, of course. An unfortunate thing to have happen to her, certainly."
@time=2015-12-20T03:10:06.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko isn't entirely convinced she means that.
@time=2015-12-20T03:10:16.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or convinced in the slightest.
@time=2015-12-20T03:11:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Does she show it?
@time=2015-12-20T03:12:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I suppose an observant person could see the doubt in her expression, but she tries to keep it to herself.
@time=2015-12-20T03:13:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I heard it was more of the ridiculous gang war that Akamine's been waging. It's ridiculous to drag such an innocent girl into that nonsense."
@time=2015-12-20T03:15:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Akamine's not so thoughtless. He knows that it's not worth his time or effort to drag outsiders into his affairs.
@time=2015-12-20T03:16:16.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"If your hypothesis is correct, I suspect Rokujou may not be as innocent as you think."
@time=2015-12-20T03:17:19.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Regardless, it's pretty nasty, disguising a bomb as a love letter, don't you think?"

@time=2015-12-20T03:21:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It might seem harsh, but I'm only telling you what I see."

@time=2015-12-20T03:23:56.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :maybe invite her somewhere for tea and cookies?

@time=2015-12-20T03:24:55.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I sort of want to give prying secrets a shot but I'm not sure if I want another conflict this late

@time=2015-12-20T03:25:26.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :this late meaning this late in the physical day
@time=2015-12-20T03:25:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I understand.
@time=2015-12-20T03:25:43.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I do have to be at the airport at like 4am.

@time=2015-12-20T03:26:21.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: yikes, i hope you get some sleep on the plane
@time=2015-12-20T03:26:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I suppose," Noriko says. Expecting to get advice either way.
@time=2015-12-20T03:27:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"If it is as you say, and Akamine is involved, I would keep my distance."

@time=2015-12-20T03:28:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko looks up at the imposing girl and gets the feeling that this is both genuine advice and a threat.
@time=2015-12-20T03:28:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Another crackle.
@time=2015-12-20T03:28:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Unless you're willing to stake yourself in Rokujou's place --"
@time=2015-12-20T03:29:17.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She's discovered that Noriko is actually layered with wrapping paper and crinkles when touched.
@time=2015-12-20T03:29:32.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :pffff
@time=2015-12-20T03:29:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko suddenly realizes that the crackling is coming from her own body. Her shoulder. The very shoulder Suzuhara has a hand on, in fact.
@time=2015-12-20T03:29:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The skin there is hot. Very hot. Burning.
@time=2015-12-20T03:30:13.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko steps back, pushing away Suzuhara's hand.

@time=2015-12-20T03:30:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Suzuhara stops speaking, but otherwise doesn't react.
@time=2015-12-20T03:30:49.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Emiko looks at Suzuhara's hand and Noriko's shoulder.
@time=2015-12-20T03:31:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's not supposed to be something Emiko could notice.
@time=2015-12-20T03:31:26.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :oh, nevermind then
@time=2015-12-20T03:31:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Unless the school uniforms are sleeveless.
@time=2015-12-20T03:31:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or Noriko is topless.
@time=2015-12-20T03:31:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'm sure the proper authorities will handle it," Noriko says.
@time=2015-12-20T03:31:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Your call.
@time=2015-12-20T03:32:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mean, sleeveless would match her fashion trait, right?
@time=2015-12-20T03:32:44.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was thinking maybe it'd be visible on the clothes too but that might not be how her power works
@time=2015-12-20T03:32:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, but they're the school's uniforms, not hers.
@time=2015-12-20T03:33:07.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You don't buy your own uniform?
@time=2015-12-20T03:33:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You don't get a lot of freedom to modify it, is what I'm saying.
@time=2015-12-20T03:33:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :True.
@time=2015-12-20T03:33:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It's a uniform.
@time=2015-12-20T03:34:17.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm not sure I want to confront Suzuhara outright here.
@time=2015-12-20T03:34:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That's good. It's for the best if you understand that."

@time=2015-12-20T03:35:46.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Haha, yes, well, I think we should back off and regroup for a different tactic. I don't want to jump straight to magic shooting.
@time=2015-12-20T03:36:23.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :we could have a chase scene
@time=2015-12-20T03:36:27.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :then the magical shooting
@time=2015-12-20T03:36:35.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I do not think Suzuhara would run.
@time=2015-12-20T03:36:42.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :*magic shooting, whatever
@time=2015-12-20T03:36:46.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Unless you meant we should run?
@time=2015-12-20T03:37:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In circles?
@time=2015-12-20T03:37:36.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, I'm not sure that magic shooting at this point is the best idea
@time=2015-12-20T03:37:42.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It'd be keeping up with our usual behavior.
@time=2015-12-20T03:37:51.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :we are still in a classroom, yes?
@time=2015-12-20T03:38:19.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I thought we might be outside now?
@time=2015-12-20T03:38:24.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :but yeah, probably near the school
@time=2015-12-20T03:39:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You're certainly somewhere.
@time=2015-12-20T03:40:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A good guess.
@time=2015-12-20T03:42:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I guess there isn't any reason we shouldn't try to stop her.
@time=2015-12-20T03:42:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :But right now?
@time=2015-12-20T03:43:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I also mean "right now" as in the real world, because I haven't eaten dinner.
@time=2015-12-20T03:43:35.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mean right now in game time.
@time=2015-12-20T03:43:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So next session.
@time=2015-12-20T03:43:49.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Are we gonna call this session here and decide where to go at the start of the next one?
@time=2015-12-20T03:43:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So you're not just going to let her walk off? Way to kidnap her.
@time=2015-12-20T03:44:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sure, let's do that. I've gotta get to cooking.
@time=2015-12-20T03:44:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Was that ever a goal? Kidnapping her?
