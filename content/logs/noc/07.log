[16-Jan-2016 21:09:06]  <IllFlower> Well, let's get the conflictin' going.
[16-Jan-2016 21:10:53]  <Calica> alright, where are we starting
[16-Jan-2016 21:11:18]  <IllFlower> In A.D. 2171, of course.
[16-Jan-2016 21:11:49]  <Rig> I believe the stake from our side was capturing Suzuhara.
[16-Jan-2016 21:12:07]  <Calica> yeah, that's what it was
[16-Jan-2016 21:12:07]  <Rig> Starting at talking seems reasonable?
[16-Jan-2016 21:12:46]  <IllFlower> For apprehending her?
[16-Jan-2016 21:13:17]  <IllFlower> Didn't we kinda already try talking last time?
[16-Jan-2016 21:13:29]  <Calica> maybe Emiko could apprehend her wit hher dazzling smile
[16-Jan-2016 21:13:31]  <Rig> It was talking, but it wasn't a conflict so much.
[16-Jan-2016 21:13:56]  <IllFlower> Obviously, Emiko is good cop.
[16-Jan-2016 21:14:10]  <IllFlower> Noriko is bad cop and Satori is... probably eating glue in a corner.
[16-Jan-2016 21:15:00]  <BGTB2005> (Satori: "No I'm not!")
[16-Jan-2016 21:15:17]  <Rig> We could also start at physical, I suppose. Just tackle her outright.
[16-Jan-2016 21:15:18]  <Calica> conflict: get back at the GM for saying you're eating glue
[16-Jan-2016 21:15:22]  <IllFlower> More like "mfmfmmffff mm not"
[16-Jan-2016 21:15:52]  <IllFlower> New challenge: the dozens as a Dogs conflict.
[16-Jan-2016 21:15:53]  <IllFlower> Anyway.
[16-Jan-2016 21:16:20]  <IllFlower> I think we kinda did the talky apprehension last time.
[16-Jan-2016 21:16:23]  <IllFlower> Or at least Satori did.
[16-Jan-2016 21:16:27]  <Rig> True.
[16-Jan-2016 21:17:01]  <Rig> I guess starting at physical is a decent point. 
[16-Jan-2016 21:17:11]  <Rig> Is everyone in on this conflict?
[16-Jan-2016 21:18:07]  <Calica> Yeah
[16-Jan-2016 21:18:11]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[16-Jan-2016 21:18:26]  <IllFlower> Okay, then I think it's best if one of you raises.
[16-Jan-2016 21:18:40]  <Rig> Okay, I guess Noriko will start.
[16-Jan-2016 21:18:44]  <Calica> physical non-fighting or physical fighting?
[16-Jan-2016 21:19:01]  <IllFlower> Up to you. It's your raise.
[16-Jan-2016 21:19:38]  <Rig> Let's try something at not-fighting first.

[16-Jan-2016 21:22:46]  <Rig> Suzuhara brushes her hair back and moves to walk by Noriko, evidently done with this conversation. Noriko reaches out as she passes and grabs her wrist, stopping her. "I won't let you go back to helping Akamine."
[16-Jan-2016 21:22:50]  <Rig> @dice use 3 4

[16-Jan-2016 21:24:32]  <Calica> interesting
[16-Jan-2016 21:25:23]  <IllFlower> So who's next?
[16-Jan-2016 21:26:30]  <Rig> BGTB2005 has the next best roll.
[16-Jan-2016 21:26:30]  <Calica> I suppose BGTB2005 would be by dice, followed by myself, then you
[16-Jan-2016 21:29:04]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005?
[16-Jan-2016 21:29:31]  <Rig> Satori could try the magic box again (at the risk of cutting off Noriko's hand, leading her to the dark side.)
[16-Jan-2016 21:30:13]  <IllFlower> Haven't we already severed enough fictional hands?
[16-Jan-2016 21:30:17]  <IllFlower> As a species?
[16-Jan-2016 21:30:23]  <BGTB2005> ...no?
[16-Jan-2016 21:30:30]  <Calica> star wars alone probably has
[16-Jan-2016 21:31:02]  <Calica> just start the box on the edge facing away from Noriko and give her a chance to get away

[16-Jan-2016 21:32:47]  <Calica> I was about to make a comment about Lance Armstrong but then I remembered that the one you linked was the Stephen Colbert one anyways
[16-Jan-2016 21:33:16]  <BGTB2005> I was thinking of trying to close off possible escape routes through the trees, but I don't think enough's happened in the conflict yet
[16-Jan-2016 21:33:43]  <IllFlower> Won't someone think of the wrists?
[16-Jan-2016 21:34:28]  <Rig> Got good strong wrists.
[16-Jan-2016 21:36:43]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: You're surrounded, etc.
[16-Jan-2016 21:42:11]  <Rig> BGTB2005: ?
[16-Jan-2016 21:42:24]  <BGTB2005> can't think of anything, sorry
[16-Jan-2016 21:42:41]  <BGTB2005> Calica can go

[16-Jan-2016 21:45:12]  <IllFlower> Maybe we should have done fistfighting. That's always pretty simple.
[16-Jan-2016 21:45:21]  <Rig> Perhaps.
[16-Jan-2016 21:45:28]  <Rig> I mean, anyone can escalate.
[16-Jan-2016 21:45:43]  <Calica> Emiko walks around to the other side of Suzuhara, grabbing her other arm.  "Too many people are going to be...have already been...hurt."

[16-Jan-2016 21:46:30]  <Rig> The power of love will compel you.
[16-Jan-2016 21:47:00]  <IllFlower> She's not really trying to go anywhere so I don't know how effective of a raise that is...
[16-Jan-2016 21:47:27]  <Calica> I mean, what's her goal then, even?  Maybe she should raise next
[16-Jan-2016 21:47:49]  <IllFlower> Attrition, obviously.
[16-Jan-2016 21:47:54]  <Rig> Her goal is to make us all feel uncomfortable and just leave.
[16-Jan-2016 21:47:58]  <IllFlower> Hahahaha.
[16-Jan-2016 21:48:15]  <Rig> I mean, if she's not leaving then we've accomplished our stakes, right?
[16-Jan-2016 21:48:20]  <Rig> Apprehension complete!
[16-Jan-2016 21:50:03]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara falls back on the ground, awkwardly wrenching her wrist a bit. She winces but otherwise disregards the pain. "It's like I said. I'm not the aggressor here."

[16-Jan-2016 21:50:27]  <BGTB2005> didn't Suzuhara keep a 4 from the last conflict?
[16-Jan-2016 21:50:56]  <IllFlower> Oh, yeah. Well, whatever, I still put forward the same dice.

[16-Jan-2016 22:00:51]  <BGTB2005> Satori recites an incantation, surrounding the area with a magical wall

[16-Jan-2016 22:01:58]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara looks from side to side, seeing the wall close in around her again.
[16-Jan-2016 22:02:21]  <IllFlower> She glances at the faces of Noriko and Emiko above her, and takes a deep breath.
[16-Jan-2016 22:03:50]  <IllFlower> "If you're so convinced I'll hurt someone, it might as well be you."

[16-Jan-2016 22:06:39]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara's body lights up with electricity like a Tesla coil, powerful enough to lift her off the ground.

[16-Jan-2016 22:14:56]  <Rig> Let's scrap that and just give.
[16-Jan-2016 22:14:58]  <Calica> is Emiko still made nough about Mayumi to not let her go
[16-Jan-2016 22:18:49]  <Rig> I dunno. Does she value Mayumi more than life?
[16-Jan-2016 22:19:08]  <Calica> probably not, yeah, and she's probably overmatched
[16-Jan-2016 22:20:12]  <BGTB2005> yeah I'd say we're outgunned here
[16-Jan-2016 22:20:16]  <Calica> seeing Noriko push away scared, Emiko also begins to notice that her life is at stake, and also pushes off from Suzuhara, rolling away from the crackling electricity.
[16-Jan-2016 22:20:52]  <BGTB2005> I fold
[16-Jan-2016 22:22:55]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara's body pushes itself upright, her feet still hovering slightly above the ground.
[16-Jan-2016 22:23:14]  <IllFlower> She turns to look at each of the Conservators in turn.
[16-Jan-2016 22:24:01]  <IllFlower> "I hope that next time, we meet under better circumstances."
[16-Jan-2016 22:24:25]  <Rig> Noriko makes an ugly face.
[16-Jan-2016 22:25:00]  <IllFlower> She turns and walks off, pushing aside the tattered, electricity-scarred remnants of Satori's barrier on her way out.
[16-Jan-2016 22:25:42]  <Calica> She had some fallout, right?
[16-Jan-2016 22:25:53]  <Rig> She just dies outright from wrist sprains.

[16-Jan-2016 22:29:07]  <Rig> Noriko glares after Suzuhara for a moment before turning to her friends. "She seems just a little bit delusional about her part in this."
[16-Jan-2016 22:30:34]  <IllFlower> Delusional and lethal. What a wonderful combination.
[16-Jan-2016 22:31:00]  <Calica> "Hmmm...The nurse didn't actually see anything wrong with Mayumi.  Maybe there is some sort of illusion going on, but what?"
[16-Jan-2016 22:32:02]  <Rig> "An illusion? It's a good one if it is, I swear those flames felt hot."
[16-Jan-2016 22:32:06]  <BGTB2005> (I suppose maybe we (Noriko) could go to Akamine and 'accidentally' let slip that Suzuhara's running from something?)
[16-Jan-2016 22:32:25]  <Rig> "So, Suzuhara is playing Akamine to get something?"
[16-Jan-2016 22:32:43]  <IllFlower> She did mention Mr. Tamura.
[16-Jan-2016 22:33:09]  <Rig> She did. We could go talk to him.

[16-Jan-2016 22:39:14]  <Rig> The bell over the door rings as Noriko and the gang enter the little convenience store a few blocks from the school. Noriko still looks a little rattled by the encounter with Suzuhara's power, not to mention the fact that a family friend could actually be a mobster. Noriko pretends to browse the candy aisle while she builds up the courage to approach the register and ask if Mr. Tamura is here.
[16-Jan-2016 22:40:47]  <Rig> Eventually she swallows her fears and grabs a package of melon candy. As she places it on the counter she asks the cashier, "Is Mr. Tamura here today?" She hopes not.
[16-Jan-2016 22:42:26]  <Rig> What do we want to ask him exactly?
[16-Jan-2016 22:43:26]  <Calica> I could see Satori just asking "Are you a mobster"
[16-Jan-2016 22:43:33]  <Calica> but maybe if he's been dealing with Suzuhara recently
[16-Jan-2016 22:43:36]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[16-Jan-2016 22:44:01]  <IllFlower> "Huh?" The college-aged part-timer at the register looks at Noriko quizzically. "Oh, yeah, I guess he's in back." He pushes the manager call button, which makes a harsh buzzing sound.
[16-Jan-2016 22:44:42]  <IllFlower> "Just a second!" an elderly voice calls out from the back.
[16-Jan-2016 22:45:36]  <IllFlower> It's not long before a diminutive, wrinkled man emerges from one of the service doors. He's maybe about Emiko's height.
[16-Jan-2016 22:46:08]  <IllFlower> "What's up?" he starts to ask the cashier, before noticing the girls standing on the other side of the counter.
[16-Jan-2016 22:46:55]  <IllFlower> "Oh, Nori! How's it going? Did you see the limited-edition mango chocolate bars up front? They're great. My granddaughter loves them."
[16-Jan-2016 22:47:30]  <Rig> See he's just too sweet to be the bad guy.
[16-Jan-2016 22:47:44]  <IllFlower> Emiko struggles to imagine this man getting involved in anything worse than a mild grandpa prank.
[16-Jan-2016 22:48:04]  <Calica> it's the nice ones you have to watch out for though
[16-Jan-2016 22:48:48]  <Rig> ("So, this magical girl who letterbombed a gang leader's girlfriend is after you for revenge because she thinks you're a mobster.")
[16-Jan-2016 22:49:02]  <Rig> ("Oh, so this is Durarara?")
[16-Jan-2016 22:49:53]  <Rig> Noriko smiles at the old man. "I'm not much for mango, Mr. Tamura."
[16-Jan-2016 22:50:01]  <Calica> correct response to that line tbh
[16-Jan-2016 22:50:27]  <IllFlower> "That's a shame. Mangoes are wonderful."
[16-Jan-2016 22:50:34]  <Rig> "My friends and I were actually hoping to talk with you about something we heard at school. Do you mind?"
[16-Jan-2016 22:51:11]  <IllFlower> "Oh?" Mr. Tamura looks genuinely curious. "What's this?"
[16-Jan-2016 22:52:36]  <Rig> Noriko glances at the cashier, who looks completely uninterested in this and appears to be fiddling with his phone. "Um, it's kinda embarrassing, but some of the upper classmen think you're an ex-gang member."
[16-Jan-2016 22:54:33]  <IllFlower> The cashier looks at Noriko in mild shock.
[16-Jan-2016 22:54:55]  <IllFlower> Mr. Tamura just laughs. "Where'd you hear that?"
[16-Jan-2016 22:55:09]  <Calica> (plot twist: the cashier is a gang member)
[16-Jan-2016 22:56:36]  <Rig> "Oh, just some upperclassmen. Do you remember who it was, Emiko?"
[16-Jan-2016 22:57:07]  <Calica> "Su...something, I think."
[16-Jan-2016 22:57:46]  <IllFlower> "'Su'?"
[16-Jan-2016 22:57:48]  <BGTB2005> "Suzuhara, but I don't think those were her exact words."
[16-Jan-2016 22:58:05]  <Calica> emiko was deliberately withholding, lol
[16-Jan-2016 22:58:15]  <Rig> Yeah, but Satori doesn't mince words.
[16-Jan-2016 22:58:19]  <Calica> true
[16-Jan-2016 22:58:20]  <IllFlower> You think Satori can read the atmosphere?
[16-Jan-2016 22:58:35]  *** Xeniera <~Xeniera@usc-secure-wireless-088-093.usc.edu> has joined #madokamadness
[16-Jan-2016 22:58:35]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Xeniera
[16-Jan-2016 22:59:34]  <IllFlower> "Suzuhara, eh?" Mr. Tamura laughs again. "Well, it's nothing to worry your pretty little head about. It's better if a girl like you stays ignorant of these things."
[16-Jan-2016 22:59:51]  <Calica> that ship's sailed
[16-Jan-2016 22:59:59]  <Rig> Noriko frowns. "That's not much of an answer, Mr. Tamura."
[16-Jan-2016 23:00:41]  <Calica> "At this point I'm not really sure staying ignorant is possible."
[16-Jan-2016 23:02:14]  <IllFlower> The cashier chooses this moment to hastily excuse himself for a smoke.
[16-Jan-2016 23:02:38]  <Calica> ("I'm going on break!" "Why do you always go on break when this stuff happens?")
[16-Jan-2016 23:03:59]  <IllFlower> "What did Suzuhara tell you, then? Specifically."
[16-Jan-2016 23:04:29]  <IllFlower> Mr. Tamura is clearly feeling Noriko out, and this doesn't make her particularly comfortable.
[16-Jan-2016 23:05:54]  <Rig> Noriko isn't used to being the one on the defensive in a conversation. "She said you... owned half the neighborhood. And some other things. She seemed upset."
[16-Jan-2016 23:06:48]  <IllFlower> "Well, half might be a bit of an exaggeration."
[16-Jan-2016 23:07:29]  <Calica> "So she wasn't completely lying..."
[16-Jan-2016 23:08:47]  <IllFlower> Mr. Tamura smiles awkwardly and claps Noriko on the shoulder. "I thought your parents might have told you about all that by now," he says with a laugh.
[16-Jan-2016 23:09:10]  <Rig> "About what?" Noriko is more confused than upset now.
[16-Jan-2016 23:11:55]  <IllFlower> "I used to work in finance," he says. "Back in the good old days. Well, you're too young to know about any of that, probably.
[16-Jan-2016 23:12:27]  <IllFlower> "Do you know what 'shorting' is?"
[16-Jan-2016 23:13:50]  <Rig> "Not really."
[16-Jan-2016 23:14:07]  <Calica> ("Isn't that a movie?")
[16-Jan-2016 23:16:18]  <IllFlower> "Well, it's kind of like this - you borrow shares in something, like a stock, and sell them to someone else with a contract to buy them back in the future. If they get cheaper, you get to keep the difference.
[16-Jan-2016 23:17:38]  <IllFlower> "Back when I was younger, when the eighties were closing out, the market was doing well, stocks and assets were at all-time highs, but I was always a bit pessimistic. So right around 1988 I put in a big short sell on basically everything.
[16-Jan-2016 23:18:53]  <Calica> i bet a lot of people hated him for that
[16-Jan-2016 23:18:55]  <IllFlower> "The bottom fell out not long afterward. I was basically retired by 1990."
[16-Jan-2016 23:19:27]  <Rig> "And that makes people accuse you of being a mobster?"
[16-Jan-2016 23:20:41]  <IllFlower> "Well, I decided to put most of my money into real estate, you see. A lot of the owners went under when prices dropped.
[16-Jan-2016 23:21:18]  <IllFlower> "It's dangerous to be one person holding that much in assets. So I had to make some arrangements with local syndicates. They didn't like what I was doing."
[16-Jan-2016 23:22:53]  <IllFlower> Mr. Tamura smiles. "It's why I run this store. The more they see my face, the less likely they are to put a bullet in my head."
[16-Jan-2016 23:23:49]  <Rig> Noriko frowns. She's unsure of what to make of this. Mr. Tamura is in with the mob. It still doesn't seem like Suzuhara has much reason for hating him though.
[16-Jan-2016 23:24:07]  <Rig> "I see," she mumbles, fiddling with the pack of candy she bought.
[16-Jan-2016 23:24:08]  <Calica> lots of people hate short sellers
[16-Jan-2016 23:24:15]  <Calica> i think china's executing them right now?
[16-Jan-2016 23:24:21]  <Rig> True, but they're generally not 17.
[16-Jan-2016 23:24:30]  <IllFlower> I dunno, China executes lots of people.
[16-Jan-2016 23:24:33]  <Rig> Anyway, is it possible to wrap up around here?
[16-Jan-2016 23:24:58]  <IllFlower> With Tamura's How I Made My Millions?
[16-Jan-2016 23:25:16]  <Rig> Yeah, I kind of need to get going in a little and I've gotta walk my dogs.
[16-Jan-2016 23:25:25]  <IllFlower> Oh, yeah, it's nearly 6:30.
[16-Jan-2016 23:25:26]  <Rig> Sorry about cutting the session short.
[16-Jan-2016 23:25:34]  <IllFlower> Let's leave off here and we'll pick up again next time.
[16-Jan-2016 23:25:38]  <Rig> I think we moved a little faster this time.
[16-Jan-2016 23:25:43]  <Rig> Thanks for running the session.
[16-Jan-2016 23:25:49]  <Calica> indeed, thanks
[16-Jan-2016 23:26:02]  *** Rig <~Iverum@2602:306:37ff:ad40:80e4:c2ee:581d:6567> has quit IRC
[16-Jan-2016 23:26:13]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, everyone. I'm off next week, so we'll be back with more sordid CNBC on the 30th.
