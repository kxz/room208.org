[14-May-2016 20:09:21]  <IllFlower> All right, so last time we left off, the characters wanted to do a stakeout.
[14-May-2016 20:11:41]  <Rig> Staking out Sanada right?
[14-May-2016 20:12:05]  <Rig> Who were we expecting to find? Just a Rinzen member?
[14-May-2016 20:12:15]  <IllFlower> For the purpose of finding who's trying to burn his place down, right?
[14-May-2016 20:12:34]  <BGTB2005> yeah, I think so
[14-May-2016 20:13:41]  <Calica> yeah
[14-May-2016 20:16:09]  <IllFlower> All right, so how do we want to run this? As a conflict, of course, but more specifically.
[14-May-2016 20:16:55]  <Rig> I think previously we ran them as physical conflicts, right?
[14-May-2016 20:17:11]  <Rig> Are we raising and seeing against boredom?
[14-May-2016 20:17:30]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[14-May-2016 20:18:00]  <Calica> razing and seeing
[14-May-2016 20:21:03]  <IllFlower> I think I'd run this as the culprit *definitely* being there. Let's say the stakes are for whether you can get the jump on the arsonist.
[14-May-2016 20:21:04]  <Rig> I think previously we were doing stakeouts to see what someone did, but now we're waiting for someone to attack Sanada. So, basically trying to stay out of sight would be the raises and our sees would be looking inconspicuous.
[14-May-2016 20:21:20]  <Rig> That works better.
[14-May-2016 20:21:23]  <IllFlower> Like, I'm not going to just have the stakeout yield zero results. :p
[14-May-2016 20:22:16]  <Rig> A good plan.
[14-May-2016 20:22:27]  <Rig> Are you going to set the scene then?
[14-May-2016 20:24:25]  <IllFlower> After their conversation in the park, the Conservators discreetly trail Sanada back to his current hideout, and set up a vantage point in a nearby caf√©.
[14-May-2016 20:25:07]  <IllFlower> It's not like they really have to try to hide. Nobody's going to give a bunch of first-year high school girls a second look in this situation.
[14-May-2016 20:25:41]  <Rig> There are a lot of cafes in this town.
[14-May-2016 20:25:51]  <IllFlower> Gotta have your coffee.
[14-May-2016 20:26:40]  <Calica> Rig: I'm pretty sure that near UCLA there's an area of four or five blocks that has at least six coffee shops and three boba places
[14-May-2016 20:26:52]  <Rig> My current town is just full of pizza.
[14-May-2016 20:26:58]  <IllFlower> Let me roll up some numbers real quick.
[14-May-2016 20:30:44]  <Rig> "Do you really think Rinzen is going to keep going after until they kill him? Arson doesn't even look like an accident at this point."
[14-May-2016 20:33:47]  <Calica> "If his testimony is that strong, maybe"
[14-May-2016 20:34:15]  <IllFlower> All right, I'll raise.
[14-May-2016 20:35:19]  <IllFlower> Physical venue.
[14-May-2016 20:35:25]  <IllFlower> After a little while, Satori notices that a man on a bench across the street has been there for a remarkably long time, looking at Sanada's complex.

[14-May-2016 20:39:32]  <Calica> looks like only Satori can save us now
[14-May-2016 20:39:42]  <IllFlower> The man gets up after a little while and starts walking. There are a lot of bushes and stuff in the way, so if the Conservators don't act fast, they'll lose him.

[14-May-2016 20:42:57]  <Rig> Noriko notices Satori's gone quieter than usual and follows her gaze to the man. "Should we follow him?" she asks, standing up. Somehow she manages to dump her mug over on herself.

[14-May-2016 20:46:09]  <Calica> Spurred on by Satori's and Emiko's motions, Emiko also tries to step up and begins to walk out the door.  She stumbles a bit as she accidentally walks in front of a waiter and has to help stabilize a stack of dishes that they won't all collapse on the floor in a messy pile.

[14-May-2016 20:46:33]  <IllFlower> These characters are not very good at tailing people.
[14-May-2016 20:46:36]  <Rig> We're basically a comedy routine.
[14-May-2016 20:47:36]  <IllFlower> Oh dear.
[14-May-2016 20:47:59]  <BGTB2005> hmm...
[14-May-2016 20:48:18]  <Calica> an explicitly comedic Dogs in the Vineyard would be an interesting experiment for sure
[14-May-2016 20:48:39]  <Rig> I raise you a pie in the face.
[14-May-2016 20:48:43]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[14-May-2016 20:48:44]  <IllFlower> Stand-up comedian conflicts against audience. If the routine goes badly, escalate to punching...
[14-May-2016 20:48:49]  <Rig> Then you can see with a bottle of seltzer.
[14-May-2016 20:49:53]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: I need a see from you.
[14-May-2016 20:51:23]  <Rig> I would suggest not falling into the pile of broken dishes or the spilled coffee.
[14-May-2016 20:51:42]  <Calica> Nonono, the dishes just barely avoided being broken
[14-May-2016 20:55:23]  <IllFlower> That would be an entertaining way to get fallout, however.
[14-May-2016 20:56:25]  <BGTB2005> Satori makes her way out of the cafe, and seems to be the only one to avoid some sort of disaster

[14-May-2016 20:56:49]  <IllFlower> Good job.
[14-May-2016 20:57:01]  <IllFlower> Okay, who wants to raise next?
[14-May-2016 20:57:07]  <IllFlower> Presumably Satori's in the best position...
[14-May-2016 20:57:18]  <Calica> yeah it should probably be Satori
[14-May-2016 20:57:39]  <IllFlower> Remember, your real opponent is losing the man, or accidentally tipping him off. Good raises might stall him.
[14-May-2016 20:57:52]  <Rig> Noriko could raise by being too unbelievably clumsy to be a tail.
[14-May-2016 20:58:38]  <BGTB2005> so outright chasing him is out?
[14-May-2016 20:59:47]  <IllFlower> You can, but I don't think it'd make a good raise. There's not much for me to respond to.
[14-May-2016 21:00:32]  <Rig> A good raise: Suddenly a train cuts off the man's path.
[14-May-2016 21:00:45]  <IllFlower> Uh...
[14-May-2016 21:02:05]  <IllFlower> More like throwing a pebble at his head to distract him.
[14-May-2016 21:02:20]  <Rig> Throwing a train at his head to distract him.
[14-May-2016 21:02:22]  <BGTB2005> ("But that's mean!")
[14-May-2016 21:02:35]  <IllFlower> We did that in the last campaign...
[14-May-2016 21:02:41]  <Rig> We did.
[14-May-2016 21:03:01]  <Rig> Using a small barrier to trip him up.
[14-May-2016 21:03:22]  <BGTB2005> yeah, that's what I was thinking
[14-May-2016 21:04:45]  <IllFlower> Works for me.
[14-May-2016 21:06:06]  <BGTB2005> With an incantation, Satori summons a small barrier in the man's path

[14-May-2016 21:13:19]  <Rig> Not sure what I can raise with, but I could give it a shot.
[14-May-2016 21:14:13]  <BGTB2005> Noriko knows what she's doing (she swears) :p
[14-May-2016 21:14:23]  <IllFlower> Maybe you can get ahead of him to try and get in a good ambush position.

[14-May-2016 21:16:44]  <Rig> Noriko manages to sop up some of the spilled coffee before throwing down a few bills on the table. She apologizes for the mess as she dashes out the door. She sees Satori has slowed the man down with a bit of magic. She takes advantage of the momentary distraction to circle around the man, trying to find a shady spot in the bushes where she can keep an eye on him.

[14-May-2016 21:19:58]  <IllFlower> It's starting to get a bit dark outside, and the man ducks off into a corner where it's hard to see him. Noriko thinks she's in the right position, but it's hard to tell from here.

[14-May-2016 21:20:51]  <Calica> flash a dazzling smile at the drug dealers' arsonist? :p
[14-May-2016 21:22:00]  <BGTB2005> circle around, bump into him, apologize and show off that dazzling smile?
[14-May-2016 21:24:05]  <IllFlower> Maybe you can try to be a woman in a red dress.
[14-May-2016 21:24:13]  <IllFlower> Look pretty.
[14-May-2016 21:25:19]  <BGTB2005> isn't that Noriko's thing?
[14-May-2016 21:25:29]  <Calica> I like the idea at least.  Maybe circle around in whatever direction he's ducked to and go for the charm offensive, playing dumb?
[14-May-2016 21:25:39]  <Calica> BGTB2005: I think Noriko's thing is trying to show she's smarter than everyone else
[14-May-2016 21:26:22]  <Rig> It's gone very well.
[14-May-2016 21:26:28]  <BGTB2005> I was going off of one of Noriko's traits
[14-May-2016 21:26:35]  <Calica> oh right, the fashion sense
[14-May-2016 21:26:59]  <IllFlower> Just, like, brazenly walk past him and flash him a smile. It could work.
[14-May-2016 21:27:18]  <BGTB2005> probably not too refined at the moment with the coffee stains
[14-May-2016 21:27:20]  <IllFlower> Emiko's supposed to be the extroverted one, after all.

[14-May-2016 21:36:53]  <Rig> We could give and just confront him directly?
[14-May-2016 21:37:06]  <Rig> Change the stakes.
[14-May-2016 21:37:33]  <IllFlower> Yeah. If you want to move to a follow-up without the advantage of surprise, that's fine.
[14-May-2016 21:38:01]  <IllFlower> I'd say it'd make the most sense if we treated this as the man getting wise to being tailed.
[14-May-2016 21:38:15]  <Rig> Yeah.
[14-May-2016 21:38:21]  <Rig> Up to BGTB2005 mostly though.
[14-May-2016 21:38:29]  <Rig> You've got the dice to continue.
[14-May-2016 21:40:02]  <IllFlower> Emiko might be able to do the "better to try than not" thing.

[14-May-2016 21:40:23]  <IllFlower> I mean, that'll be fallout, but it's not a huge problem.
[14-May-2016 21:40:33]  <IllFlower> Not necessarily one, rather.
[14-May-2016 21:40:50]  <Rig> BGTB2005: Maybe try hiding in the shadows or sealing the alley with magic?
[14-May-2016 21:41:00]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: Let me add "he takes a look around to make sure he's not being watched" to the raise.
[14-May-2016 21:41:02]  <Calica> up to 9d6 fallout is getting there though, and then I'd have to escalate to have a chance anyways, etc

[14-May-2016 21:41:51]  <IllFlower> Or 6 5 2, rather.
[14-May-2016 21:42:13]  <BGTB2005> I guess sealing the area might work, but I've already used the barrier magic trait
[14-May-2016 21:42:24]  <Calica> @dice add 1d6 >! I guess I may as well roll either way, at least
[14-May-2016 21:42:24]  <Omnipresence> 14: Rolled 1 = 1. Bank now has 1 1 1 1 2 5 = 11.
[14-May-2016 21:42:31]  <Calica> hahaha nope
[14-May-2016 21:42:33]  <BGTB2005> pffff
[14-May-2016 21:42:35]  <IllFlower> Okay, so a give?
[14-May-2016 21:43:07]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: You can try using the "track" trait for swift movement.
[14-May-2016 21:43:35]  <IllFlower> I don't think you've ever actually tapped that one before.
[14-May-2016 21:43:52]  <Rig> Noriko loses track of the man as he goes into the alley. She trusts that Emiko or Satori will keep up as she falls back to see if she can do anything to clean up her appearance.
[14-May-2016 21:45:35]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: You'd need an 8 to see without fallout, but hey, it's always worth a shot.
[14-May-2016 21:48:18]  <Calica> Emiko sees the man emerging with the lighter fluid, and gets scared.  She steps away.
[14-May-2016 21:48:44]  <IllFlower> ÊÄñ„ÅÑ„Çà„ÅÖ
[14-May-2016 21:49:12]  <BGTB2005> Taking a moment for some quick warmup stretches, Satori sprints after the man to find a better vantage point
[14-May-2016 21:49:26]  <BGTB2005> @dice add d8 > Track Star Satori
[14-May-2016 21:49:26]  <Omnipresence> 14Track Star Satori: Rolled 7 = 7. Bank now has 2 2 5 5 5 7 = 26.
[14-May-2016 21:49:59]  <Calica> IllFlower: is that "i'm scared"
[14-May-2016 21:50:10]  <IllFlower> yeah, p much
[14-May-2016 21:52:04]  <BGTB2005> hmmm
[14-May-2016 21:55:20]  <BGTB2005> on the one hand, I'm not afraid of fallout
[14-May-2016 21:55:44]  <BGTB2005> on the other, I don't think that was exactly a stealthy maneuver
[14-May-2016 21:56:43]  <Calica> there are shadows and the like around
[14-May-2016 21:57:39]  <BGTB2005> unless he's deaf or something I think you'd be able to hear someone running though
[14-May-2016 21:58:35]  <BGTB2005> also I need to leave
[14-May-2016 21:58:48]  <BGTB2005> I do have my phone so I might be able to continue through that

[14-May-2016 22:08:00]  <Calica> Satori suddenly freezes up, caught in a panic attack.  Her only words: "Ping timeout: 190 seconds"
[14-May-2016 22:08:43]  <IllFlower> People around her begin to be afflicted by the same disease. Oh God, the zombie apocalypse has started!
[14-May-2016 22:13:35]  <IllFlower> Why don't we pick up next time, then? It's up to BGTB2005 whether Satori takes fallout in order to get the jump on our man.

[14-May-2016 22:17:07]  <BGT|Mobile> Did i miss anything?
[14-May-2016 22:17:18]  <IllFlower> Nope. Just waiting for your decision.
[14-May-2016 22:17:40]  <Calica> your decision can also be "My connection's too crap, I'm going to postpone this to next session"
[14-May-2016 22:21:12]  <BGT|Mobile> I guess I'll take the fallout
[14-May-2016 22:21:32]  <BGT|Mobile> Need to see 13, right?
[14-May-2016 22:21:40]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[14-May-2016 22:21:45]  <IllFlower> Then you can just raise anything.

[14-May-2016 22:22:14]  <IllFlower> It doesn't really matter what dice you use, I'm just going to assume an additional 3d6 fallout and call this conflict over.
[14-May-2016 22:22:34]  <IllFlower> Rig, Calica, BGT|Mobile: Everyone roll fallout.
[14-May-2016 22:22:38]  <IllFlower> @dice roll 3d6
[14-May-2016 22:22:38]  <Omnipresence> 14IllFlower: Rolled 3 5 5 = 13.
[14-May-2016 22:22:40]  <Calica> I only have the 3d6, right?
[14-May-2016 22:22:40]  <Rig> @dice roll 3d6
[14-May-2016 22:22:40]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Rolled 1 3 3 = 7.

[14-May-2016 22:22:45]  <IllFlower> Calica: I think so.
[14-May-2016 22:22:57]  <Calica> short-term + xp, right?
[14-May-2016 22:23:00]  <Rig> XP and Short Term.
[14-May-2016 22:23:00]  <BGT|Mobile> @dice roll 3d6
[14-May-2016 22:23:00]  <Omnipresence> 14BGT|Mobile: Rolled 1 1 3 = 5.
[14-May-2016 22:23:04]  <IllFlower> Ooh, our guy really fucked up his ankle.
[14-May-2016 22:23:15]  <Rig> Oops.
[14-May-2016 22:23:23]  <BGT|Mobile> Lol oops
[14-May-2016 22:23:36]  <BGT|Mobile> Gj satori
[14-May-2016 22:23:55]  <IllFlower> Gonna knock a die off the unassigned 2d10 trait.
[14-May-2016 22:24:25]  <IllFlower> Everyone else has XP plus short-term.
[14-May-2016 22:25:46]  <Rig> Gonna knock down fashion sense for my short-term. Was thinking of upping "not a fighter" to 2d4.
[14-May-2016 22:27:06]  <IllFlower> For XP?
[14-May-2016 22:27:07]  <Calica> I think knocking one off Bd might make sense for short-term, but not sure, and not sure about XP
[14-May-2016 22:27:13]  <IllFlower> Rig: Seems like an odd good thing.
[14-May-2016 22:27:43]  <Rig> True. I don't know if there was anything in this conflict that really lends itself to XP fallout though.
[14-May-2016 22:27:50]  <BGT|Mobile> On my phone, so can i sort out my fallout next session?
[14-May-2016 22:28:02]  <Rig> Spilled some coffee and sorta failed at ambushing.
[14-May-2016 22:28:44]  <IllFlower> "I can recover from mistakes." Sort of.
[14-May-2016 22:29:59]  <Rig> I could bump up "I know what I'm doing" since that seems sorta similar.
[14-May-2016 22:30:32]  <IllFlower> Calica: I'll take -1 Bd. As for XP, maybe +1 Ht since the smile kinda worked...
[14-May-2016 22:30:53]  <IllFlower> Rig: To d6 or to 3d?
[14-May-2016 22:31:00]  <Rig> d6, I was thinking.
[14-May-2016 22:31:19]  <Calica> IllFlower: hm, that works
[14-May-2016 22:31:22]  <BGT|Mobile> Hmmm
[14-May-2016 22:31:32]  <IllFlower> Rig: Maybe rewrite it to "I know what I'm doing, even if it looks bad at first"?
[14-May-2016 22:31:44]  <IllFlower> More of a founded confidence.
[14-May-2016 22:32:25]  <Rig> I'm good with that.
[14-May-2016 22:32:49]  <BGT|Mobile> For xp maybe add a die to barrier magic?
[14-May-2016 22:33:12]  <IllFlower> Or d10 it, maybe.
[14-May-2016 22:33:32]  <BGT|Mobile> Maybe 
[14-May-2016 22:34:01]  <BGT|Mobile> Yeah i think that sounds good
[14-May-2016 22:34:50]  <IllFlower> And then for short-term maybe 2d4 "violence is not an acceptable answer." She's got adrenaline pumping.
[14-May-2016 22:35:25]  <BGT|Mobile> Sure
[14-May-2016 22:35:27]  <IllFlower> Oh, wait, can't do that. Bah. Can 1d8 -> 1d4 "excels at track," though.
[14-May-2016 22:36:13]  <BGT|Mobile> Perhaps she didn't warm up sufficiently 
[14-May-2016 22:36:17]  <IllFlower> Yeah...
[14-May-2016 22:36:25]  <IllFlower> Should've listened to the coach.
[14-May-2016 22:37:02]  <IllFlower> Okay, I think we can wrap up here for now. We'll pick up next time with the Conservators trying to keep this guy from setting Sanada's apartment aflame.
[14-May-2016 22:37:21]  <IllFlower> Sorry for the short session. I have to be on my way soon as well.
[14-May-2016 22:37:42]  <Rig> Thanks for running the session. Hopefully we get more done next time.
[14-May-2016 22:37:52]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, everyone. We'll see you next week.
