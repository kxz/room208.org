[12-Dec-2015 21:15:39]  <IllFlower> Okay, last we left off, the Conservators were busy being unable to console a high school girl.
[12-Dec-2015 21:15:56]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://room208.org/wiki/events | RIGHT NOW: Novus Ordo Conservatorum
[12-Dec-2015 21:16:09]  <Calica> correct.
[12-Dec-2015 21:16:35]  <IllFlower> Good job.
[12-Dec-2015 21:17:05]  <IllFlower> Anyway, the girls head off to class in rather low spirits.
[12-Dec-2015 21:18:19]  <Rig> A good start to a school day.
[12-Dec-2015 21:18:31]  <IllFlower> Even Noriko can't do much but brood over the situation, and as a result none of them absorb much during their first period classes.
[12-Dec-2015 21:20:13]  <IllFlower> When the bell rings, the rest of the first-year girls almost immediately break off into small insistently whispering cliques. A few glances are thrown at Mayumi's vacant desk.
[12-Dec-2015 21:21:54]  <IllFlower> What's stranger is that one of the boys is staring directly at Mayumi's desk, with a half-absent grin on his face.
[12-Dec-2015 21:22:04]  <Rig> What a creep.
[12-Dec-2015 21:22:09]  <Calica> Do we recognize which boy?
[12-Dec-2015 21:22:13]  <Calica> Is it the scary one?
[12-Dec-2015 21:22:29]  <BGTB2005> wasn't the scary one a third year?
[12-Dec-2015 21:22:34]  <Calica> oh yeah
[12-Dec-2015 21:23:48]  <IllFlower> Emiko vaguely remembers him as one of those people who doesn't show up to class very often. He was gone for something like two weeks straight recently.
[12-Dec-2015 21:24:08]  <Rig> Truancy or medical leave?
[12-Dec-2015 21:24:15]  <IllFlower> Who knows.
[12-Dec-2015 21:24:26]  <IllFlower> He certainly doesn't look like the frail type.
[12-Dec-2015 21:25:51]  <Rig> I feel like someone should say something to him, but I feel like Emiko would do that before Noriko.
[12-Dec-2015 21:28:46]  <Calica> Alright.
[12-Dec-2015 21:29:38]  <Rig> Noriko gives the boy a pointed look. She can only assume he doesn't realize that he's being impolite.
[12-Dec-2015 21:30:11]  <Calica> Emiko walks up to the boy.  "Hey, I notice you've been absent a lot recently.  Has something happened recently?"
[12-Dec-2015 21:32:11]  <IllFlower> The grin evaporates from the boy's face with jarring speed, as if to compensate for Emiko's good-hearted cheer. "Who's asking?" he says in a dismissive voice.

[12-Dec-2015 21:34:24]  <Calica> "I'm just worried, what with the huge fight recently, and what happened to Mayumi this morning..."
[12-Dec-2015 21:39:14]  <IllFlower> "Oh, that." The boy laughs, and pulls back the collar of his uniform to reveal a collage of dark welts and bandages on the skin of his chest. "I had a bit of a run-in."
[12-Dec-2015 21:40:21]  <Calica> "With Mayumi?"
[12-Dec-2015 21:40:55]  <Calica> wait, was that supposed to be about the fight?  if not, i guess it could be taken as a joke anyways V:
[12-Dec-2015 21:41:13]  <Rig> I imagined it was about the fight, but I assumed Emiko was making a joke.
[12-Dec-2015 21:43:02]  <IllFlower> "You're funny," the boy says, in the tone of someone who doesn't think for a second that Emiko's funny.
[12-Dec-2015 21:44:00]  <IllFlower> "Though who knows. Maybe Minase is weak enough that he needs his girl to dish out the pain for him. That'd be hilarious." The smirk returns to his face.
[12-Dec-2015 21:44:41]  <Calica> is minase akamine?
[12-Dec-2015 21:45:03]  <IllFlower> Minase's another one of those delinquent types, Emiko remembers. A second-year. He's had stitches on his face for a little bit.
[12-Dec-2015 21:46:24]  <Rig> Mayumi is dating a delinquent? How scandalous.
[12-Dec-2015 21:47:14]  <IllFlower> Love works in mysterious ways. Especially when you're fifteen.
[12-Dec-2015 21:47:21]  <Rig> Good point.
[12-Dec-2015 21:48:19]  <Calica> I feel like I should maybe try to get more info out of him but I'm not sure how I would proceed, even in a conflict situation
[12-Dec-2015 21:48:52]  <Rig> Maybe we should just make a note of the new information about Mayumi's love life and talk to her about it later.
[12-Dec-2015 21:49:25]  <Rig> Or you could swing a "Oh, I didn't know they were still dating." sorta thing and see if we get anything else.
[12-Dec-2015 21:49:37]  <Calica> Did Emiko know they were dating?
[12-Dec-2015 21:49:51]  <Rig> She does now. :P
[12-Dec-2015 21:50:21]  <IllFlower> "These look worse than they are," the boy says, pointing to his chest again. "Minase thinks he's got something going, but his little group is full of pussies. I think you could take them in a fight, actually." He looks Emiko up and down with that grin of his intact.
[12-Dec-2015 21:50:26]  <IllFlower> Calica: Your choice.
[12-Dec-2015 21:51:25]  <Rig> High schoolers and their gangs.
[12-Dec-2015 21:53:28]  <Calica> "I don't know about that; I'm not good at fights.  Wasn't aware Minase and Mayumi were still dating though."
[12-Dec-2015 21:56:13]  <IllFlower> "I'd keep an eye on him, if I were you. His reaction's going to be... entertaining."
[12-Dec-2015 21:57:56]  <IllFlower> He drums his fingers on his desk in anticipation. "He never thought we'd get Rokujou involved in this mess. Just goes to show you how weak his position is."
[12-Dec-2015 21:58:42]  <Rig> Wow, these kids take their gang wars seriously.
[12-Dec-2015 21:59:11]  <Calica> Rig: haven't you seen durarara
[12-Dec-2015 21:59:15]  <Rig> Nope.
[12-Dec-2015 21:59:33]  <Rig> All I know about that is that there is a headless motorcyclist.
[12-Dec-2015 21:59:42]  <Rig> So I assume it's basically just Japanese Sleepy Hollow.
[12-Dec-2015 22:01:42]  <Rig> So, did this weirdo admit to letterbombing Mayumi?
[12-Dec-2015 22:01:51]  <Calica> Rig: he or someone in his group, yes
[12-Dec-2015 22:03:13]  <Rig> Noriko jumps in, "You're just letterbombing innocent people?"
[12-Dec-2015 22:05:15]  <IllFlower> "Huh?" He looks up at Noriko. "'Sthat some kind of metaphor? I'm not smart enough for that kind of stuff, Hisakawa."
[12-Dec-2015 22:06:57]  <Calica> "I'm guessing you know someone who is, though."
[12-Dec-2015 22:07:59]  <IllFlower> "For metaphors?"
[12-Dec-2015 22:08:50]  <Calica> "For letter bombs."

[12-Dec-2015 22:12:02]  <Rig> "Like he said, he's not much on brains. I doubt he can even open his own locker, let alone Mayumi's."

[12-Dec-2015 22:16:21]  <IllFlower> I dunno, maybe he could wrench it open with sheer ignorant force.
[12-Dec-2015 22:18:04]  <Rig> It'd be quite a feat.
[12-Dec-2015 22:19:19]  <IllFlower> "Well, if you want details, ask the guy upstairs. I doubt Akamine would tell you, but maybe he'll take mercy on a poor old friend of Rokujou's."
[12-Dec-2015 22:19:31]  <IllFlower> The boy laughs again.
[12-Dec-2015 22:19:43]  <Rig> Noriko rolls her eyes.
[12-Dec-2015 22:21:15]  <IllFlower> Burn.
[12-Dec-2015 22:21:33]  <Calica> Emiko narrows her eyes, and looks to Noriko.  "Not sure how much more he's going to tell us."  she whispers.
[12-Dec-2015 22:21:42]  <Calica> "Not sure how much he even knows."
[12-Dec-2015 22:25:00]  <Rig> "It's probably not worth our time anyway," Noriko replies. "We'd probably be better off asking Minase."
[12-Dec-2015 22:25:06]  <IllFlower> He'd be a good match for our very literal Satori.
[12-Dec-2015 22:27:59]  <IllFlower> And yes, you probably would.

[12-Dec-2015 22:31:44]  <IllFlower> Magic him to death for being a dick, obviously.
[12-Dec-2015 22:31:58]  <BGTB2005> ^
[12-Dec-2015 22:32:32]  <Rig> That's a bit extreme.
[12-Dec-2015 22:34:13]  <IllFlower> Only a bit? BGTB2005 has gotten to you.
[12-Dec-2015 22:34:57]  <Rig> I mean, he is a dick.
[12-Dec-2015 22:35:24]  <Calica> Yeah but even if he did do the letterbombing magicking him to death is pretty extreme
[12-Dec-2015 22:36:04]  <IllFlower> Man, you guys are no fun.
[12-Dec-2015 22:36:06]  <BGTB2005> I still think Rin may have been involved somehow
[12-Dec-2015 22:36:22]  <IllFlower> Anyway, you could ask Minase.
[12-Dec-2015 22:36:35]  <Calica> works for me

[12-Dec-2015 22:39:13]  <IllFlower> Burn.
[12-Dec-2015 22:39:33]  <BGTB2005> Lunch sounds good
[12-Dec-2015 22:39:38]  <IllFlower> She's right. My face isn't very good at the things a bum is good at.
[12-Dec-2015 22:39:47]  <Calica> lunch sounds good to me too
[12-Dec-2015 22:39:48]  <Rig> Sitting on it?
[12-Dec-2015 22:39:59]  <IllFlower> Who sits on their lunch?
[12-Dec-2015 22:40:07]  <Rig> It keeps it warm.
[12-Dec-2015 22:40:16]  <tinytop> deliberate obfuscation!!
[12-Dec-2015 22:40:47]  <IllFlower> Warm and smelling vaguely of bung.
[12-Dec-2015 22:41:33]  <Rig> Noriko grabs Emiko and Satori as they make their way to a table during lunch. "Minase is sitting alone," she points out.
[12-Dec-2015 22:41:45]  <IllFlower> Minase always eats lunch with the same group of boys - and Mayumi - which makes today remarkable in two ways.
[12-Dec-2015 22:42:14]  <IllFlower> Three, maybe. Did anyone actually order the vegetable lunch set?
[12-Dec-2015 22:42:19]  <Rig> "Why don't we join him?"
[12-Dec-2015 22:42:33]  <Calica> "Sounds like a good idea."
[12-Dec-2015 22:42:51]  *** ShowerAvenue is now known as CentralAve
[12-Dec-2015 22:44:09]  <Rig> "Mind if we join you?" Noriko says, not waiting for an answer as she sits down across from Minase.
[12-Dec-2015 22:48:56]  <Rig> "How are you doing?"
[12-Dec-2015 22:49:19]  <Rig> (Sorry, making dinner at the same time)
[12-Dec-2015 22:50:05]  <IllFlower> A series of emotions cross Minase's face: first shock at Noriko's brazen entrance, then mildly pleasant surprise that a not-unattractive underclassman is sitting down, then annoyance when he realizes who Noriko's brought along.
[12-Dec-2015 22:50:18]  <Calica> is it Emiko or Satori he's annoyed at
[12-Dec-2015 22:50:23]  <IllFlower> Emiko and Minase aren't on the greatest of terms, you see.
[12-Dec-2015 22:52:13]  <Calica> "Hello Minase."
[12-Dec-2015 22:52:40]  <IllFlower> Minase grimaces in Emiko's general direction.
[12-Dec-2015 22:53:10]  <IllFlower> "You're gonna lecture me about Mayu again, aren't you?"
[12-Dec-2015 22:53:25]  <Calica> hahaha
[12-Dec-2015 22:54:01]  <Calica> "I assume you've heard about this morning..."
[12-Dec-2015 22:55:05]  <IllFlower> "You're funny."
[12-Dec-2015 22:55:18]  <IllFlower> Has Emiko thought of going into stand-up comedy?
[12-Dec-2015 22:57:35]  <Rig> "You're getting that a lot."
[12-Dec-2015 22:58:23]  <Calica> "Anyways, what's going on, that people are going after her?"
[12-Dec-2015 23:00:33]  <IllFlower> "I dunno. Maybe they're jealous."
[12-Dec-2015 23:00:48]  <IllFlower> Minase laughs at his own joke.
[12-Dec-2015 23:01:23]  <Calica> Emiko doesn't budge.
[12-Dec-2015 23:02:09]  <IllFlower> "Nah, I don't even know why you're answering that question. It's the Highland Boys, obviously. Akamine doesn't like me stepping on his toes."
[12-Dec-2015 23:02:46]  <IllFlower> His answer seems remarkably carefree for someone whose girlfriend received a flaming letter this morning, but maybe that's just how he is.
[12-Dec-2015 23:03:37]  <Rig> "Seems a little intense to try to burn someone over a schoolyard scuffle."
[12-Dec-2015 23:06:40]  <IllFlower> "Why are you telling me? I'm just as much the victim here as she is."
[12-Dec-2015 23:07:40]  <Rig> "It just seems odd to me. What did you do to make piss off Akamine?"
[12-Dec-2015 23:07:49]  <Rig> strike to make
[12-Dec-2015 23:09:26]  <IllFlower> "Guy thinks he owns the neighborhood. I just want to get together with a few friends and do silly shit, right? And he doesn't like that."
[12-Dec-2015 23:11:38]  <Rig> Noriko shrugs. Minase makes it seem reasonable.
[12-Dec-2015 23:13:33]  <IllFlower> As reasonable as people beating each other up and setting things on fire can be,
[12-Dec-2015 23:13:59]  <Rig> I mean, he certainly hasn't tried to light anyone on fire.
[12-Dec-2015 23:14:07]  <Rig> To Noriko's knowledge.
[12-Dec-2015 23:14:24]  <IllFlower> He does still have the stitches on his face, though.
[12-Dec-2015 23:14:55]  <Calica> "What sort of silly shit escalates to blowing up the girlfriend, though?"
[12-Dec-2015 23:19:18]  <IllFlower> "Well, let's be honest. We're already beating each other up in the hallways."
[12-Dec-2015 23:21:17]  <Rig> Noriko eyes the stitches. It looks like it'll leave a scar. "Yeah, that follows. Throw a punch, commit some arson, rob some stores."
[12-Dec-2015 23:21:53]  <IllFlower> "Pretty much. I'm glad someone understands."
[12-Dec-2015 23:23:05]  <Calica> does Satori have anything to say about this?
[12-Dec-2015 23:23:38]  <IllFlower> Minase leans forward. "Hey, if that's your thing, do you want to join? Red Minamoto is always recruiting."
[12-Dec-2015 23:24:31]  <Rig> "That's the name of your gang?"
[12-Dec-2015 23:25:52]  <IllFlower> "That's us. I'm the 'Mina,' Kurimoto's the 'moto.' Though he's not around now."
[12-Dec-2015 23:25:52]  <Rig> "I think I'll pass but thanks for the offer."
[12-Dec-2015 23:26:15]  <Rig> "Where is your 'moto' then?"
[12-Dec-2015 23:26:16]  <Calica> do any of us recognize that name
[12-Dec-2015 23:27:06]  <IllFlower> "Suspended. He slugged some kid hard enough to send him to the hospital. Ueno? I think that was his name."
[12-Dec-2015 23:27:18]  <IllFlower> Oh, yeah, Emiko remembers. That boy from earlier was named Ueno.

[13-Dec-2015 00:06:28]  <IllFlower> "And besides, the whole thing seems like such a girl's way of doing it. Tricking someone into thinking they've gotten a love letter or something? I couldn't think of that."
[13-Dec-2015 00:07:10]  <IllFlower> Minase takes a mouthful of rice, chews it around thoroughly.
[13-Dec-2015 00:08:00]  <IllFlower> "It's gotta be one of the girls. Akamine's got a few around him, but if you can crack one of them, I'm sure you'll find out who it was quick enough.
[13-Dec-2015 00:08:14]  <IllFlower> "Then... we do to him what he did to me. Double."
[13-Dec-2015 00:08:55]  <Calica> Emiko looks at Noriko.  We're supposed to be solving what's going on, not contributing to it!
[13-Dec-2015 00:09:30]  <BGTB2005> Satori stands up. "No. You're horrible. I'm not helping."
[13-Dec-2015 00:11:35]  <IllFlower> Minase looks at Satori for a few seconds, then immediately files her away in the same mental bucket he's got for Emiko.
[13-Dec-2015 00:11:57]  <IllFlower> "Nobody said you had to. We can just make it her and me."
[13-Dec-2015 00:13:25]  <Rig> Noriko looks to Emiko and then Satori. "Maybe we can make this a little more agreeable to everyone."
[13-Dec-2015 00:14:31]  <Rig> "Instead of cold-blooded revenge of such an uncreative manner, we find out who did this, and expose them. Get them expelled."
[13-Dec-2015 00:15:12]  <Rig> "It weakens Akamine, shows that you can get things done the smart way, and no one gets hurt... per se."
[13-Dec-2015 00:16:19]  <IllFlower> "Per se," Minase repeats.
[13-Dec-2015 00:17:26]  <IllFlower> Minase smiles. "You're a smart one. I like that."
[13-Dec-2015 00:18:31]  <Calica> "I'm a little unsure, but it sounds good to me."
[13-Dec-2015 00:19:22]  <IllFlower> "Then it's settled."
[13-Dec-2015 00:19:37]  <IllFlower> Minase extends a hand towards Noriko.
[13-Dec-2015 00:19:45]  <IllFlower> "I look forward to working with you."
[13-Dec-2015 00:22:44]  <IllFlower> I'm going to wind this session up soon, since I have another engagement this evening and I need to not look like I've been doing IRC RPs all afternoon.
[13-Dec-2015 00:23:03]  <Calica> fair enough
[13-Dec-2015 00:23:55]  *** Lin_Chong <~Kevin@116.87.102.42> has joined #madokamadness
[13-Dec-2015 00:24:12]  * Icon snickers.
[13-Dec-2015 00:24:45]  <Rig> Noriko shakes Minase's hand. "I'm sure we'll work well together."
[13-Dec-2015 00:24:52]  <Rig> Thanks for the session, IllFlower.
[13-Dec-2015 00:25:02]  <Rig> Sorry I was in and out. Cooking dinner and RPing is a little difficult.
[13-Dec-2015 00:25:06]  <Calica> thank you for the session
[13-Dec-2015 00:25:26]  <IllFlower> Cool, we'll wrap up here, then. Thanks for playing, all.
[13-Dec-2015 00:25:41]  <IllFlower> I was kinda doing laundry in the middle of all this so no excuses are needed.
[13-Dec-2015 00:25:43]  <Rig> We're playing again next weekend, right?
[13-Dec-2015 00:25:50]  <IllFlower> Yup. Same time, same virtual place.
[13-Dec-2015 00:25:56]  <Rig> Good. Long breaks suck.
[13-Dec-2015 00:25:57]  <IllFlower> It's on the calendar, of course.
[13-Dec-2015 00:26:16]  <Rig> Yeah, I'll add that calendar to my personal one.
[13-Dec-2015 00:27:03]  <Rig> Enjoy your night.
