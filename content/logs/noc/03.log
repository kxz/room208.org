[15-Nov-2015 00:35:43]  <IllFlower> Let's go ahead and get started.
[15-Nov-2015 00:37:17]  <IllFlower> It's an unusually warm day for the middle of November. The sun shines bright in the sky as Emiko, Satori, and Noriko make their way to school.
[15-Nov-2015 00:39:19]  <IllFlower> Noriko vaguely remembers one study that linked warm weather to an increase in violence, and sure enough, the latest topic of conversation at usually peaceful Kumagawa High is a massive brawl that broke out in the hallways around lunchtime earlier in the week.
[15-Nov-2015 00:40:20]  <IllFlower> The principal was forced to cancel classes for the rest of the day, and about a dozen students were apparently suspended.
[15-Nov-2015 00:40:38]  <IllFlower> Jump in whenever.
[15-Nov-2015 00:41:37]  <Rig> "Did you know anyone who got suspended Emiko?" She seemed to know everyone, so it was pretty likely.
[15-Nov-2015 00:41:50]  <IllFlower> The mood this morning is, unsurprisingly, quite tense.
[15-Nov-2015 00:42:16]  <Rig> Noriko realizes that Emiko probably wasn't on the same train of thought as her and adds "For that fight earlier."
[15-Nov-2015 00:43:45]  <Calica> "I know a few of them, yeah.  Why?"
[15-Nov-2015 00:44:45]  <Rig> "Do you know what they were fighting about? It seems kinda... out of character for anyone at the school to start a brawl."
[15-Nov-2015 00:46:44]  <Calica> Do I?
[15-Nov-2015 00:47:06]  <Rig> Quick, make up a ridiculous reason and we can take the plot away from IllFlower.
[15-Nov-2015 00:47:30]  <BGTB2005> 14betting 500 yen Rin was somehow involved
[15-Nov-2015 00:47:41]  <Rig> They all watched Kung Fu Hustle and wanted to imitate the Axe Gang.
[15-Nov-2015 00:48:38]  <Calica> I was thinking a "none of them knew, they all got hit first" thing but I don't know what IllFlower is pointing towards so
[15-Nov-2015 00:49:12]  <IllFlower> Mind if I puppet Emiko for a sec?
[15-Nov-2015 00:49:35]  <Calica> I don't mind, no.

[15-Nov-2015 00:53:16]  <Rig> "Akamine?" Noriko hadn't run into her, but was glad she hadn't. "I don't think I've met her. How about you Satori?"
[15-Nov-2015 00:53:53]  <IllFlower> Him. But continue.
[15-Nov-2015 00:54:17]  <IllFlower> Another blow for equality, though. Girls instigating huge fights.
[15-Nov-2015 00:54:42]  <Rig> Like that'd be new in this world.
[15-Nov-2015 00:55:01]  <BGTB2005> Satori thinks, then shakes her head
[15-Nov-2015 00:55:22]  <Rig> "Guess we should count ourselves lucky."
[15-Nov-2015 00:55:39]  <Rig> "Was he suspended too?"
[15-Nov-2015 00:56:46]  <IllFlower> "I don't know. He's always on the fringes, never in the fray. I'm sure the teachers are looking for an excuse, though."
[15-Nov-2015 00:57:12]  <Calica> is Emiko still being puppeted?  When should I jump back in?
[15-Nov-2015 00:57:21]  <IllFlower> Jump.

[15-Nov-2015 01:01:45]  <Calica> "But even so, it seems a bit weird how nobody knows what anyone was fighting about, doesn't it?"
[15-Nov-2015 01:01:59]  <IllFlower> Suspicious, innit.
[15-Nov-2015 01:02:47]  <Rig> "Maybe a witch?"
[15-Nov-2015 01:03:29]  <IllFlower> ("You always think it's a witch.")

[15-Nov-2015 01:05:56]  <BGTB2005> "I guess it makes sense."
[15-Nov-2015 01:06:57]  <IllFlower> The three girls run into Mayumi at the entrance to the school.
[15-Nov-2015 01:07:18]  <IllFlower> "Good morning, Emiko!" she says, not really knowing the other two well enough to greet them in similar fashion.
[15-Nov-2015 01:08:21]  <Calica> "Hey Mayumi!  How're you doing today?"
[15-Nov-2015 01:10:14]  <IllFlower> "I'm doing great. Did you watch yesterday's Ama-chan?"
[15-Nov-2015 01:12:08]  <Calica> "Nah, I was tired.  Catching up on all the schoolwork they had to go through way too fast to keep pace, you know?"
[15-Nov-2015 01:12:50]  <IllFlower> Mayumi laughs. "Yeah, that makes sense."
[15-Nov-2015 01:13:08]  <IllFlower> She pulls open her shoe locker and spots something inside.
[15-Nov-2015 01:13:21]  <IllFlower> "Is that... no way, it looks like a letter."
[15-Nov-2015 01:14:52]  <Calica> "Is it something private?"
[15-Nov-2015 01:15:24]  <IllFlower> "I don't know! I've never gotten anything like this before..."
[15-Nov-2015 01:16:17]  <IllFlower> Mayumi reaches a hand inside the locker and pulls out something that certainly looks like a love letter in an envelope. It's even sealed with a little heart sticker.
[15-Nov-2015 01:16:29]  <Calica> :o
[15-Nov-2015 01:16:59]  <IllFlower> She turns it around in her hands. "It doesn't look like it's got a name written on --"

[15-Nov-2015 01:17:59]  <IllFlower> What happens next all comes too fast to really register: a flash of light, a scream, the smell of burning.
[15-Nov-2015 01:18:19]  <Calica> that escalated quickly
[15-Nov-2015 01:18:35]  <IllFlower> When everyone's senses come to, Mayumi is standing in shock, the letter on the floor burning far more intensely than paper has any right to.
[15-Nov-2015 01:19:31]  <BGTB2005> 14betting 10,000 yen Rin was involved somehow
[15-Nov-2015 01:20:03]  <Rig> "Mayumi, are you okay?"
[15-Nov-2015 01:20:04]  <IllFlower> Mayumi's legs give out from under her. She slumps onto her knees about two feet away from the flames, tears beginning to well in her eyes.
[15-Nov-2015 01:20:14]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@CPEbc4dfb91a083-CMbc4dfb91a080.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[15-Nov-2015 01:21:31]  <IllFlower> Someone comes rushing in from the hallway with a fire extinguisher. Thankfully, it doesn't look like Mayumi suffered any burns.
[15-Nov-2015 01:21:35]  <Calica> Emiko runs towards Mayumi to try to support her and keep her away from the flames
[15-Nov-2015 01:25:17]  <Rig> Noriko stays back while the flames are extinguished. "What happened?" she asks no one in particular.
[15-Nov-2015 01:28:07]  *** CentralAve is now known as Charlotte
[15-Nov-2015 01:28:52]  <IllFlower> Mayumi is sobbing inconsolably. It's all Emiko can do to keep her upright.
[15-Nov-2015 01:29:05]  <Rig> "We should take her to the nurse."
[15-Nov-2015 01:29:24]  <IllFlower> Good idea.
[15-Nov-2015 01:32:08]  <Calica> should we FFWD>> to the nurse?
[15-Nov-2015 01:32:29]  *** Charlotte is now known as CentralAve
[15-Nov-2015 01:33:26]  <IllFlower> The nurse is understandably a little surprised when Mayumi comes in crying, flanked by three other girls. It doesn't take long for her to sort out what happened, though.
[15-Nov-2015 01:34:45]  <IllFlower> She guides Mayumi to one of the beds, where Mayumi finally stops crying after a full five minutes. It seems to be more out of exhaustion than relief.
[15-Nov-2015 01:35:27]  <IllFlower> Mayumi mutely offers her hands for examination, at which point the nurse confirms that she is at least physically unharmed.
[15-Nov-2015 01:36:07]  <IllFlower> "Do you have any idea who would do something like this?" the nurse asks.
[15-Nov-2015 01:36:39]  <IllFlower> More silence from Mayumi. The nurse looks at the other girls, wondering if they might have any insight.
[15-Nov-2015 01:36:46]  <Rig> Noriko shakes her head. She barely knows the girl anyway.
[15-Nov-2015 01:36:57]  <Calica> "No idea.  Mayumi isn't someone who makes a lot of enemies.
[15-Nov-2015 01:37:13]  <Calica> "A lot of people seem to be acting kinda strange lately, though..."
[15-Nov-2015 01:38:19]  <IllFlower> "You're telling me," the nurse says.
[15-Nov-2015 01:39:34]  <IllFlower> "If Rokujou can't tell me anything, there isn't much else I can do, though."
[15-Nov-2015 01:41:34]  <Calica> "Anything, Mayumi?"
[15-Nov-2015 01:41:48]  <IllFlower> You could try gently conflicting it out of her.
[15-Nov-2015 01:42:09]  <IllFlower> You vs. her recalcitrance.
[15-Nov-2015 01:42:29]  <Calica> what do Rig and BGTB2005 think?  I like it, but it's also getting late.
[15-Nov-2015 01:42:48]  <IllFlower> I imagine we'd stop after this.

[15-Nov-2015 02:13:36]  <Calica> yeah i think it's basically over now
[15-Nov-2015 02:13:45]  <IllFlower> Do you want to give now or later?
[15-Nov-2015 02:14:49]  <Calica> actually yeah I think I'll just give now.
[15-Nov-2015 02:15:57]  <IllFlower> Noriko is gone, but otherwise the situation remains largely the same.
[15-Nov-2015 02:16:36]  <Rig> Hahaha. Send Noriko away and then give.
[15-Nov-2015 02:16:53]  <IllFlower> The nurse, at a loss for what to do, takes the other girls out of the room and tells them in the hallway that she'll call Mayumi's parents.
[15-Nov-2015 02:18:52]  <Rig> Noriko returns to find her friends standing in the hall. "I have these," she says, holding out the a foil package of cookies."
[15-Nov-2015 02:21:37]  <Calica> "Well, it'll be hard to give them to Mayumi right now.  Sorry for sending you out at such a bad time!"
[15-Nov-2015 02:22:54]  <IllFlower> An awkward silence descends on the Conservators. The hallways are about empty now, as classes have already started.
[15-Nov-2015 02:22:55]  <Rig> "It's okay. It was kind of awkward anyway. I barely know her."
[15-Nov-2015 02:25:19]  <Calica> "It really is weird, though.  First the fight, and now this?"
[15-Nov-2015 02:25:20]  <Rig> We're late for class.
[15-Nov-2015 02:25:27]  <Calica> and yeah, we're late for class
[15-Nov-2015 02:25:52]  <IllFlower> The nurse will give you a note.
[15-Nov-2015 02:26:17]  <IllFlower> Noriko might be more annoyed at missing material than not having an excuse note, however.
[15-Nov-2015 02:26:24]  <Rig> Heh.
[15-Nov-2015 02:26:35]  <Calica> heh
[15-Nov-2015 02:28:41]  <Rig> Gah, trying to come up with a decent way to say "We should investigate this." But we kinda know to do that.
[15-Nov-2015 02:28:53]  <Calica> i kinda tihnk this is a good place to stop anyways
[15-Nov-2015 02:28:57]  <IllFlower> It is.
[15-Nov-2015 02:29:37]  <IllFlower> Let's pick up again next week.
[15-Nov-2015 02:29:41]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, all.
