title: Novus Ordo Conservatorum session 21
---
[09-Jul-2016 20:05:07]  <IllFlower> Anyway, we never did reflection fallout from the last arc, so let's start with that.
[09-Jul-2016 20:05:23]  <IllFlower> Then we'll get a move on.
[09-Jul-2016 20:07:48]  <IllFlower> I vote for a bump in Noriko's "I can be a jerk" stat.
[09-Jul-2016 20:08:01]  <Rig> Hahaha, why?
[09-Jul-2016 20:08:12]  <Rig> It's been so long that I need to remember what happened.
[09-Jul-2016 20:08:14]  <IllFlower> Am I just going to turn all of your characters into Kazuki? Hm.
[09-Jul-2016 20:08:29]  <IllFlower> Well, you managed to blackmail a crooked cop, so good job.
[09-Jul-2016 20:09:57]  <BGT|Mobile> Yay?
[09-Jul-2016 20:10:47]  <Calica> we brought down adachi maybe even?
[09-Jul-2016 20:11:08]  *** Rig <~rig@2602:306:37ff:ad40:ccbf:690a:d88f:3907> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
[09-Jul-2016 20:11:27]  <Calica> and rig apparently
[09-Jul-2016 20:11:46]  *** Rig <~rig@2602:306:37ff:ad40:ccbf:690a:d88f:3907> has joined #madokamadness
[09-Jul-2016 20:11:47]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Rig
[09-Jul-2016 20:11:59]  *** Rig <~rig@2602:306:37ff:ad40:ccbf:690a:d88f:3907> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
[09-Jul-2016 20:12:00]  *** Rig <~rig@2602:306:37ff:ad40:ccbf:690a:d88f:3907> has joined #madokamadness
[09-Jul-2016 20:12:01]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Rig
[09-Jul-2016 20:12:54]  <IllFlower> Well, that's an optimistic way to spin things, isn't it? :p
[09-Jul-2016 20:13:24]  <Calica> Given an actually successful stakeout, maybe something pushing off that?  Or managing to successfully trick the police, given the fake names thing?  I forget why I decided Emiko needed to give the police fake names in the first place
[09-Jul-2016 20:14:07]  <IllFlower> Because you thought it'd be funny.
[09-Jul-2016 20:14:34]  <Calica> probably part of it tbh.  But it never backfired!
[09-Jul-2016 20:15:13]  <IllFlower> Yeah, if it had you would have just thrown your best friend under the bus. ;)
[09-Jul-2016 20:15:26]  <Calica> I think I only used half of her name!
[09-Jul-2016 20:15:46]  <IllFlower> Anyway, we're getting off track.
[09-Jul-2016 20:17:26]  <IllFlower> Emiko did a bit of talking last time, so that should count for something.
[09-Jul-2016 20:18:18]  <IllFlower> Someone should take an "I'm a detective" trait.
[09-Jul-2016 20:19:16]  <Rig> Satori.
[09-Jul-2016 20:20:56]  <Calica> Satori devolps her forensics skills to avoid having to do the talking
[09-Jul-2016 20:21:09]  <BGT|Mobile> Pff
[09-Jul-2016 20:22:21]  <Calica> as for talking, maybe add a trait on a charming voice or something?  Like the dazzling smile, but works over the phone :p
[09-Jul-2016 20:22:32]  <IllFlower> The only words she speaks are "Zoom. Enhance."
[09-Jul-2016 20:25:20]  <Rig> Calica: Compelling voice?
[09-Jul-2016 20:25:38]  <IllFlower> Gentle persuasion.
[09-Jul-2016 20:25:45]  <IllFlower> Charm!
[09-Jul-2016 20:25:49]  <Calica> Rig: that almost makes me think magical mind-control, lol
[09-Jul-2016 20:27:08]  <IllFlower> That would be far more nefarious.
[09-Jul-2016 20:27:39]  *** BGT2011 <Mibbit@66.226.46.186> has joined #madokamadness
[09-Jul-2016 20:28:01]  *** BGT|Mobile <~AndChat42@66.226.46.186> has quit IRC (Quit: Bye)
[09-Jul-2016 20:29:22]  <IllFlower> Maybe "charm offensive" would be a good way to put it.
[09-Jul-2016 20:29:39]  <Calica> Maybe.  Replace the smile or as a new one though?
[09-Jul-2016 20:29:42]  <IllFlower> Noriko I mostly remember being good at veiled threats.
[09-Jul-2016 20:29:50]  <IllFlower> Calica: They're supposed to be kinda the same thing, no?
[09-Jul-2016 20:29:52]  <Rig> I mean, nefarious sounds good, but I guess we can skip it.
[09-Jul-2016 20:29:56]  <Calica> IllFlower: yeah, basically
[09-Jul-2016 20:30:18]  <Calica> Rig: It would be interesting but I'm not sure if we have the precedent for it yet.  Maybe if I do something that could trigger a demon, hahaha
[09-Jul-2016 20:30:29]  <IllFlower> Oh, goddammit.
[09-Jul-2016 20:30:51]  <IllFlower> Of course it's the fellow running a Sorcerer game who always likes the idea of being possessed.
[09-Jul-2016 20:31:20]  <Calica> It makes a nice break from trying to RP six demons at once
[09-Jul-2016 20:33:27]  <IllFlower> By just having one?
[09-Jul-2016 20:34:53]  <Calica> exactly.  Though actually, Vince Baker says that Dogs' analogue to the demons is actually your gun
[09-Jul-2016 20:36:29]  <IllFlower> For some reason I can't help but interpret that as a euphemism.
[09-Jul-2016 20:36:35]  <IllFlower> Anyway, Calica has one.
[09-Jul-2016 20:36:40]  <BGT2011> hmmm
[09-Jul-2016 20:36:44]  <Calica> I guess I have a second still to do...hmmm
[09-Jul-2016 20:36:48]  <IllFlower> I don't think anyone else has changed their stuff yet.
[09-Jul-2016 20:39:26]  <BGT2011> Trying to remember what all Satori did
[09-Jul-2016 20:40:02]  <IllFlower> Get that guy trippin'.
[09-Jul-2016 20:44:10]  <IllFlower> Rig: The "I am not a fighter" thing seems like something.
[09-Jul-2016 20:44:32]  <Rig> Yeah, I was thinking that Noriko spent a lot of time getting beat down.
[09-Jul-2016 20:44:45]  <IllFlower> Relationship-wise, I dunno. Maybe someone cares for the younger Inamura even though she can be a bit sarcastic.
[09-Jul-2016 20:45:21]  <Rig> Hm, do I change the die size or just bump it up by 1 die?
[09-Jul-2016 20:47:05]  <IllFlower> I'd say bump it up by 1. It's still something that handicaps Noriko, just with more of a chance of her not getting hurt badly.
[09-Jul-2016 20:47:34]  <IllFlower> I don't think she'd consider herself a fighter, in other words, and that'd hamstring her psychologically. But she's getting better at not getting beat down.
[09-Jul-2016 20:48:38]  <Rig> Hahaha, no evidence for that.
[09-Jul-2016 20:51:13]  <IllFlower> The better at not getting beat down?
[09-Jul-2016 20:51:19]  <Rig> Yeah
[09-Jul-2016 20:51:21]  <IllFlower> She's not dead yet, so that's gotta count for something!
[09-Jul-2016 20:51:34]  <IllFlower> I mean, Higashiyama only broke her bones once.
[09-Jul-2016 20:51:47]  <Rig> I think I'm gonna add another die to Higashiyama's relationship too.
[09-Jul-2016 20:51:56]  <BGT2011> I almost want to add a die to Barrier Magic, but I'm not sure if Satori did enough with it to justify that
[09-Jul-2016 20:52:58]  <Calica> I mean, she did trip all those people
[09-Jul-2016 20:53:36]  <IllFlower> It seems like Satori is turning into the silent-but-deadly enforcer.
[09-Jul-2016 20:53:50]  <IllFlower> I think there might be room for something more offensively-based in there.
[09-Jul-2016 20:54:50]  <BGT2011> Also I'm thinking of going through with rewriting her 1d10 relationship to 'Takumi-senpai'
[09-Jul-2016 20:55:27]  <IllFlower> Are you going to turn this into a love triangle?
[09-Jul-2016 20:55:56]  <Calica> man, I still haven't decided what to do with Emiko's boyfriend
[09-Jul-2016 20:55:59]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[09-Jul-2016 20:56:07]  <Rig> Love rectangles.
[09-Jul-2016 20:56:08]  <BGT2011> sure why not
[09-Jul-2016 20:59:03]  <IllFlower> hoo boy, let's try not to encourage infighting
[09-Jul-2016 21:00:33]  <BGT2011> but it's fun :<
[09-Jul-2016 21:02:14]  <IllFlower> So some obvious ones: stat bumps, grudging relationship with Inamura, "I CONTROL THE POLICE BWAHAHAHAHA"...
[09-Jul-2016 21:04:14]  <Calica> Inamura's the one who ended up giving us info on the police investigation, right?
[09-Jul-2016 21:05:33]  <IllFlower> Yeah. Whose mother is a cop.
[09-Jul-2016 21:06:40]  <Calica> I kind of like the idea of the grudging Inamura relationship then.  Let's let our characters get annoyed with Inamura and still have to go to him(?)
[09-Jul-2016 21:07:17]  <IllFlower> Her.
[09-Jul-2016 21:07:30]  <IllFlower> Also the one who the Conservators peeled off from Akamine's little group.
[09-Jul-2016 21:07:31]  <BGT2011> that sounds fun
[09-Jul-2016 21:07:48]  <IllFlower> We have the character summary for a reason! :/
[09-Jul-2016 21:08:21]  <Calica> somehow I forgot about the colors :V
[09-Jul-2016 21:09:19]  <IllFlower> >_>
[09-Jul-2016 21:10:17]  <BGT2011> :|
[09-Jul-2016 21:12:09]  <Calica> added Inamura at 1d6 and an extra 1d6
[09-Jul-2016 21:12:53]  <IllFlower> All right, done.
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:02]  <IllFlower> RIG I NEED SOME NUMBERS FROM YOU
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:06]  <IllFlower> BGT2011 YOU TOO
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:19]  <Rig> 11
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:19]  <BGT2011> hmmm
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:20]  <Rig> 22
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:22]  <Rig> 34
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:31]  <BGT2011> 13
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:32]  <BGT2011> 48
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:34]  <Rig> I added a die to "not a fighter"
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:39]  <BGT2011> 259
[09-Jul-2016 21:13:42]  <Rig> And one to the relationship with Higashiyama.
[09-Jul-2016 21:14:54]  <IllFlower> That's Numberwang!
[09-Jul-2016 21:15:02]  * Calica rotates the board
[09-Jul-2016 21:17:19]  <IllFlower> I wonder if "violence is not an acceptable answer" isn't a bit at odds with Satori's actions lately...
[09-Jul-2016 21:17:32]  <BGT2011> a bit, probably
[09-Jul-2016 21:18:43]  <BGT2011> added a die to Barrier Magic, still have one more fallout
[09-Jul-2016 21:19:48]  <IllFlower> I kinda want to argue that it should be 2d8 instead of 2d10. Then if you drop "violence" etc. or replace it with something else...
[09-Jul-2016 21:20:19]  <IllFlower> Maybe she's okay with targeted violence.
[09-Jul-2016 21:22:12]  <IllFlower> "Afraid of collateral damage" 1d4?
[09-Jul-2016 21:23:44]  <BGT2011> hmm
[09-Jul-2016 21:25:23]  <BGT2011> I guess that sounds good
[09-Jul-2016 21:27:12]  <IllFlower> Any objections from the gallery?
[09-Jul-2016 21:27:55]  <Calica> none from here
[09-Jul-2016 21:29:00]  <IllFlower> Okay, that's all wrapped.
[09-Jul-2016 21:29:02]  <BGT2011> still want to rewrite that 1d10 relationship
[09-Jul-2016 21:29:31]  <IllFlower> I don't think Takumi's gonna fly, not unless you can explain it *really* well.
[09-Jul-2016 21:29:49]  <BGT2011> wasn't he on the track and field team?
[09-Jul-2016 21:30:09]  <IllFlower> I mean in terms of how it wouldn't be an instant source of tension between Satori and Noriko.
[09-Jul-2016 21:31:03]  <Calica> Satori's too quiet and Noriko doesn't notice until she finally stands in front of him and tries to ask him out but can't find the words
[09-Jul-2016 21:31:09]  <IllFlower> Because that would pretty greatly change the dynamic of the group.
[09-Jul-2016 21:31:38]  <IllFlower> Anyway, we came here to roleplay, so let's do that before I have to go elsewhere...
[09-Jul-2016 21:31:56]  <Rig> Don't you have some kind of input thing to go to?
[09-Jul-2016 21:32:15]  <IllFlower> Eh?
[09-Jul-2016 21:32:20]  <IllFlower> Heh.
[09-Jul-2016 21:32:35]  <Rig> Sorry, I was scheduling flights. It turns out moving across the country and then having to fly across the country to be at your brother's wedding is terrible.
[09-Jul-2016 21:32:52]  <IllFlower> That it is.
[09-Jul-2016 21:34:43]  <IllFlower> We open on Satori at home, chewing on a pencil while doing her homework.
[09-Jul-2016 21:35:45]  <IllFlower> It's a nervous habit of hers. Try not to pick on her for it.
[09-Jul-2016 21:35:46]  *** Rig <~rig@2602:306:37ff:ad40:ccbf:690a:d88f:3907> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
[09-Jul-2016 21:36:23]  *** Rig <~rig@99-127-250-212.lightspeed.iplsin.sbcglobal.net> has joined #madokamadness
[09-Jul-2016 21:36:23]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Rig
[09-Jul-2016 21:37:14]  <IllFlower> Chie knocks on the open door of her sister's room. It's hard for her to get Satori's attention otherwise.
[09-Jul-2016 21:38:15]  <IllFlower> "Hey, have you heard anything from Suzuhara?" she asks.
[09-Jul-2016 21:40:27]  <BGT2011> "No. Why?"
[09-Jul-2016 21:40:48]  <IllFlower> "Mm." Chie frowns.
[09-Jul-2016 21:41:01]  <IllFlower> "She hasn't been at school the past few days.
[09-Jul-2016 21:41:32]  <IllFlower> "Well, I mean, that's normal. I haven't been able to reach her at all, is what bothers me."
[09-Jul-2016 21:43:57]  <BGT2011> "Hmm."
[09-Jul-2016 21:44:54]  <IllFlower> "It's, um... if you don't know anything, that's fine."
[09-Jul-2016 21:45:12]  <IllFlower> Chie disappears off into the hallway.
[09-Jul-2016 21:45:40]  <IllFlower> Come to think of it, hadn't Akamine mentioned something about the elder Suzuhara also being gone from school? Huh.
[09-Jul-2016 21:46:24]  <BGT2011> Sounds like possibly something the Conservators should ivnestigate
[09-Jul-2016 21:46:49]  <IllFlower> Cut to Noriko, busy *not* doing homework. Probably secretly fawning over Takumi. He's dreamy.
[09-Jul-2016 21:47:52]  <Rig> Can you be busy not doing things?
[09-Jul-2016 21:47:58]  <IllFlower> Phone call from a number she doesn't recognize, which she assumes means it's something to do with magic. It always is.
[09-Jul-2016 21:48:31]  <Rig> Noriko answers the phone. "Hello?"
[09-Jul-2016 21:48:53]  <IllFlower> "Ceteris nescientibus," the voice on the other end says. It sounds like a boy about her age.
[09-Jul-2016 21:49:30]  <Rig> Bless you
[09-Jul-2016 21:49:36]  <IllFlower> The Order's standard greeting for strangers. So she was right.
[09-Jul-2016 21:49:38]  <IllFlower> Noriko sighs.
[09-Jul-2016 21:50:34]  <IllFlower> Then talks, of course.
[09-Jul-2016 21:50:48]  <Rig> Just trying to decide if she should sneeze down the phone line too.
[09-Jul-2016 21:52:18]  <Rig> "Ceteris nescientibus. Who is this?"
[09-Jul-2016 21:54:45]  <IllFlower> "My name's Juusakon. I'm a Conservator from the north side of town. Different precinct.
[09-Jul-2016 21:55:20]  <IllFlower> "I was told you had to deal with a Rei Suzuhara recently. Is that right?"
[09-Jul-2016 21:57:29]  <Rig> "Oh? Yeah. We had an altercation with her but she fled. Do you have information about her?"
[09-Jul-2016 21:58:05]  <Rig> Noriko's daydreams have gone from Takumi to taking down Suzuhara.
[09-Jul-2016 21:58:48]  <IllFlower> "Not so much that. There've been rumors that she might be in our neck of the woods, so I was assigned to find her."
[09-Jul-2016 21:59:28]  <Rig> "Oh," she says, disappointed. "Is there anything I can do to help?"
[09-Jul-2016 21:59:32]  <IllFlower> Assigned? Noriko tries to think back to the last time someone told her what magical occurrences to deal with. Trouble mostly seemed to find her.
[09-Jul-2016 22:00:27]  <IllFlower> "Um..." Juusakon sounds a little disappointed. "I thought you'd have an idea of where she might be."
[09-Jul-2016 22:01:28]  <IllFlower> Then, in a more flustered tone, "It doesn't have to be specific! Just the sorts of places she likes, or whatever..."
[09-Jul-2016 22:03:56]  <Rig> "Um," Noriko thinks about how Suzuhara acted in the short time they were tailing her. It feels like it happened months ago.
[09-Jul-2016 22:04:50]  <Rig> "She was focused on getting revenge for something, but it wasn't clear what it was. We think she instigated or caused arsons. She also enlisted the help of a group of civilians hooligans to help her."
[09-Jul-2016 22:05:23]  <IllFlower> "Arson? Is she a fire mage?"
[09-Jul-2016 22:06:16]  <Rig> Noriko remembers the burns from Suzuhara's touch. "Yes, almost certainly."
[09-Jul-2016 22:06:36]  <BGT2011> didn't she use lightning magic?
[09-Jul-2016 22:06:54]  <Rig> Did she?
[09-Jul-2016 22:06:55]  <IllFlower> Yeah, she did.
[09-Jul-2016 22:07:04]  <Rig> Oh, um, scratch that.
[09-Jul-2016 22:07:23]  <Calica> the fire was an illusion, I think?
[09-Jul-2016 22:08:08]  <IllFlower> Nah, it was localized electrical conductivity. Or witches.
[09-Jul-2016 22:08:31]  <Rig> "She uses lightning magic, but that's not far removed from fire."
[09-Jul-2016 22:10:29]  <IllFlower> "I see. Doesn't sound like fun.
[09-Jul-2016 22:11:41]  <IllFlower> "Well, let me know if you see hide or hair of her. We can't have someone like her running around unchecked."
[09-Jul-2016 22:13:37]  <Rig> "Good luck tracking her down."
[09-Jul-2016 22:13:58]  <IllFlower> "Thanks."
[09-Jul-2016 22:14:12]  <Rig> Noriko almost hopes he doesn't so she gets another shot.
[09-Jul-2016 22:14:15]  <IllFlower> Cut to the next morning.
[09-Jul-2016 22:14:57]  <IllFlower> It's inter-period break, the sixth consecutive day of Rei Suzuhara's absence.
[09-Jul-2016 22:15:38]  <Calica> I thought Rei disappeared for a while?
[09-Jul-2016 22:17:25]  <IllFlower> "Satori?" Emiko asks, looking at her friend with concern. "Something bothering you?"
[09-Jul-2016 22:17:51]  <IllFlower> Calica: It hasn't been that long. Six might be a bit low. Let's say ten, then.
[09-Jul-2016 22:19:37]  <BGT2011> "Hmmm..."
[09-Jul-2016 22:21:00]  <BGT2011> "Chie asked about Suzuhara last night."
[09-Jul-2016 22:21:14]  <Calica> "She was friends with her sister, right?"
[09-Jul-2016 22:22:05]  <BGT2011> Satori nods
[09-Jul-2016 22:26:16]  <Rig> Noriko joins the group, "I got a call last night from another Conservator."
[09-Jul-2016 22:26:23]  <Rig> "They asked about Suzuhara."
[09-Jul-2016 22:26:41]  <Calica> "Did they find her?"
[09-Jul-2016 22:28:00]  <Rig> "Just rumors, I think. He wanted to know if we had any clues on how to track her down."
[09-Jul-2016 22:30:58]  <IllFlower> So both of the Suzuhara sisters are gone. Rei the Conservators couldn't really care less about, but Ruri...
[09-Jul-2016 22:32:54]  <BGT2011> I think Noriko cares about Rei
[09-Jul-2016 22:33:18]  <Rig> Would be nice to figure out what's going on with that family in general.
[09-Jul-2016 22:33:22]  <Calica> cares, but really in teh other direction
[09-Jul-2016 22:35:39]  <IllFlower> Well, okay, sure.
[09-Jul-2016 22:35:55]  <IllFlower> Ruri's a truant, but she's caught up in something ugly.
[09-Jul-2016 22:36:22]  <Calica> But yeah, we should probably figure out what's up with Ruri at least.  Also Rei because she's dangerous.
[09-Jul-2016 22:36:30]  <Rig> "He asked if we knew where she'd likely be. Maybe your sister knew more about that?"
[09-Jul-2016 22:37:00]  <BGT2011> We're probably not talking about the same Suzuhara
[09-Jul-2016 22:37:13]  <BGT2011> but maybe if we find one...
[09-Jul-2016 22:37:49]  <IllFlower> Maybe.
[09-Jul-2016 22:39:24]  <IllFlower> But then how would we go about that?
[09-Jul-2016 22:39:44]  <BGT2011> "I think she might know something."

[09-Jul-2016 22:40:08]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Rig
[09-Jul-2016 22:40:10]  <IllFlower> Follow Chie around like the stalker Satori is?
[09-Jul-2016 22:40:36]  <Rig> Stalking is always good.
[09-Jul-2016 22:41:53]  <BGT2011> I guess Satori could just ask
[09-Jul-2016 22:42:10]  <Calica> but that would make sense, and this is emdogs
[09-Jul-2016 22:42:11]  <BGT2011> Invite her over to Emiko's for cookies and a talk?
[09-Jul-2016 22:44:07]  <Calica> works for me
[09-Jul-2016 22:44:41]  <IllFlower> lol, it's always cookies
[09-Jul-2016 22:44:58]  <BGT2011> cookies are yummy
[09-Jul-2016 22:45:09]  <Calica> I mean, Emiko does have a baking trait, and BGT2011 is always ready for tea and cookies...
[09-Jul-2016 22:45:55]  <IllFlower> Hm, if Ruri's been gone for as long as we think, why hasn't anyone reported it to the police...
[09-Jul-2016 22:46:33]  <Calica> the parents are also missing, etc.
[09-Jul-2016 22:48:57]  <IllFlower> That would be even more concerning!
[09-Jul-2016 22:48:57]  <Rig> The police are in on it.
[09-Jul-2016 22:49:04]  <IllFlower> Oh, shit.
[09-Jul-2016 22:49:08]  <BGT2011> D:
[09-Jul-2016 22:49:30]  <IllFlower> Anyway, it's time to play the "grill Chie" game, isn't it.
[09-Jul-2016 22:50:39]  <Calica> What, no, Emiko's just baking cookies, not Chie!
[09-Jul-2016 22:51:53]  <Calica> but yes, I think it's time to grill Chie.  Just, not like that.
[09-Jul-2016 22:52:20]  <IllFlower> Man, all you people do is ask her questions.
[09-Jul-2016 22:52:52]  <Rig> You're saying we could try punching her?
[09-Jul-2016 22:53:13]  <Calica> I don't think Satori would like that!
[09-Jul-2016 22:53:24]  <IllFlower> So the Conservators all meet up at Satori's house.
[09-Jul-2016 22:55:06]  <BGT2011> wasn't going to emiko's the plan?
[09-Jul-2016 22:55:27]  <IllFlower> Chie gets home a little late. She gets excited on catching the smell of cookies baking, but her expression quickly changes when she realizes who's making them. "Um, hi?" she says, regarding Noriko and Emiko skeptically.
[09-Jul-2016 22:55:58]  <Calica> "Hey, Chie!  We're sorry for having to inconvenience you about this, but..."
[09-Jul-2016 22:56:07]  <Rig> Noriko is getting used to Chie's skepticism about her involvement.
[09-Jul-2016 22:59:40]  <IllFlower> Chie grimaces, but isn't rude enough to just turn around and leave. And she likes cookies.
[09-Jul-2016 23:00:24]  <IllFlower> "Honestly, I don't get how the two of you are even friends with my sister, but whatever. You're here to ask about Suzuhara, aren't you?"
[09-Jul-2016 23:00:44]  <Calica> "Unfortunately, yes."
[09-Jul-2016 23:01:29]  <Rig> Noriko smiles awkwardly, like she's been caught in a lie. "Yeah."
[09-Jul-2016 23:02:53]  <IllFlower> Chie grabs a cookie and takes a bite.
[09-Jul-2016 23:04:32]  <Rig> Noriko nudges Emiko with her elbow. 
[09-Jul-2016 23:04:37]  <IllFlower> "She can fend for herself. I think. I guess I'm starting to get a little worried."
[09-Jul-2016 23:06:19]  <BGT2011> @ship Chie/Ruri
[09-Jul-2016 23:08:22]  <Calica> "Do you know where she might be?"
[09-Jul-2016 23:09:49]  <IllFlower> "Maybe at her boyfriend's?
[09-Jul-2016 23:10:15]  <IllFlower> "I'd check, but it's not safe for me to go wandering around by myself."
[09-Jul-2016 23:10:35]  <Calica> dashing BGT's ship hopes
[09-Jul-2016 23:11:15]  <BGT2011> even when contradicted by the gm i still ship it
[09-Jul-2016 23:11:41]  <IllFlower> "And there's a good chance the last boyfriend I met isn't hers anymore..."
[09-Jul-2016 23:13:05]  <Calica> "Does she go through them fast?"
[09-Jul-2016 23:14:13]  <IllFlower> "That's one way to put it."
[09-Jul-2016 23:15:50]  <IllFlower> Chie leans back. "Still, it's probably better than nothing. Hold on, she told me where he lives..."
[09-Jul-2016 23:16:41]  <IllFlower> She pulls out her phone and zooms into the map of a neighborhood about four or five stations away.
[09-Jul-2016 23:17:27]  <IllFlower> Hadn't Juusakon said he was from the north? If you look at it right, the train line does kinda go north.
[09-Jul-2016 23:20:23]  <Calica> time to go north, I guess.  (Maybe in the next session, though.)
[09-Jul-2016 23:20:47]  <BGT2011> yeah
[09-Jul-2016 23:21:10]  <IllFlower> Maybe. We have already run a while.
[09-Jul-2016 23:21:56]  <IllFlower> Faster fallout in future, folks. ;)
[09-Jul-2016 23:22:50]  <IllFlower> Our next session is going to have to be a Sunday one, since I won't be available next Saturday. Any objections?
[09-Jul-2016 23:23:12]  <Calica> nope
[09-Jul-2016 23:24:14]  <Rig> When is that scheduled?
[09-Jul-2016 23:24:15]  <IllFlower> In any case, thanks for playing, everyone. We'll do a conflict next time, I promise.
[09-Jul-2016 23:24:23]  <IllFlower> Sunday the 17th.
[09-Jul-2016 23:24:40]  <Rig> Okay.
[09-Jul-2016 23:24:53]  <IllFlower> I just added a calendar event. CALENDARS ARE YOUR GOD
[09-Jul-2016 23:25:02]  <IllFlower> See you in a week!
[09-Jul-2016 23:25:02]  <Rig> I know, I have 9 of them.
[09-Jul-2016 23:25:09]  <Rig> See you. Thanks for running the session.
