[14-Nov-2015 21:37:33]  <IllFlower> Anyway, we're doing initiations. Who wants to go first?
[14-Nov-2015 21:37:50]  <IllFlower> (Who has an idea?)
[14-Nov-2015 21:38:00]  <BGTB2005> i have a vague one
[14-Nov-2015 21:38:49]  <IllFlower> Do tell.

[14-Nov-2015 21:43:03]  <IllFlower> Bueller?
[14-Nov-2015 21:43:21]  <Rig> I'm assuming I didn't miss anything during the awkward timeout then?
[14-Nov-2015 21:43:24]  <Calica> nope
[14-Nov-2015 21:43:42]  <Calica> BGTB2005 is probably writing something, he seems to be kind of a slow typer anyways though
[14-Nov-2015 21:44:03]  <Rig> I dunno what to do with Noriko's initiation. Maybe something about showing her knowledge?
[14-Nov-2015 21:44:04]  <IllFlower> That's my new band, Awkward Timeout.
[14-Nov-2015 21:44:04]  <BGTB2005> I'm thinking, maybe Chie got into a fight with some other kids after school, and Satori wants to end the conflict without violence?
[14-Nov-2015 21:44:35]  <Calica> for Emiko I'm thinking maybe something where she tries to assert herself but not sure about specfiics
[14-Nov-2015 21:44:38]  <Calica> *specifics
[14-Nov-2015 21:44:39]  <IllFlower> Chie's the kind of kid who would get into a fight? Hm.
[14-Nov-2015 21:45:04]  <IllFlower> So let's say Satori wants to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
[14-Nov-2015 21:45:19]  <IllFlower> Or allowing violence to happen?
[14-Nov-2015 21:45:49]  <IllFlower> I assume Satori's not much of an instigator.
[14-Nov-2015 21:46:07]  <BGTB2005> well she has all of 2 will
[14-Nov-2015 21:46:16]  <IllFlower> Just checking.
[14-Nov-2015 21:46:54]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's say I play Chie and you play Satori (of course), and you're trying to talk her down.
[14-Nov-2015 21:47:23]  <IllFlower> I dunno if this would be at school. The two of them go to different schools because of the age difference, right? Maybe a neighborhood thing.
[14-Nov-2015 21:48:23]  <BGTB2005> yeah, my idea was it happening as they walked home from their respective schools
[14-Nov-2015 21:49:09]  <IllFlower> So who would Chie get in a fight with?
[14-Nov-2015 21:51:00]  <BGTB2005> I dunno, probably some other kids that were making fun of her or her sister?
[14-Nov-2015 21:52:04]  <IllFlower> What for?
[14-Nov-2015 21:53:03]  <IllFlower> I could totally go for the weird religious family angle.
[14-Nov-2015 21:53:51]  <BGTB2005> yeah, probably
[14-Nov-2015 21:55:00]  <IllFlower> Let's set the stage, then. We're out on the street, Chie's about to go berserk on some classmates mocking her family, and Satori's trying desperately to stop her.
[14-Nov-2015 21:55:13]  <IllFlower> We'll start at talking, I assume?
[14-Nov-2015 21:55:28]  <IllFlower> Calica, Rig, feel free to bounce around ideas while we work on this conflict.
[14-Nov-2015 21:55:30]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[14-Nov-2015 21:56:23]  <IllFlower> All right. Roll Ac+Ht to start, plus your relevant 2d10 relationship.
[14-Nov-2015 21:56:32]  <IllFlower> I get 4d6 4d10 as always...

[14-Nov-2015 21:57:11]  <IllFlower> All right, BGTB2005, I think it's best if you raise first.
[14-Nov-2015 21:57:43]  <Calica> Rig: For you?  My first thought is some student council thing, trying to show off your knowledge to sempai
[14-Nov-2015 21:58:03]  <Rig> Hahaha, that's not a bad one. I meant more if you had any ideas for your character.
[14-Nov-2015 22:02:13]  <IllFlower> I don't think it would make particular sense for Chie to be all "I'm going to continue to punch this idiot in the face like before!" after all.
[14-Nov-2015 22:02:34]  <Rig> Nah, that's a great raise.
[14-Nov-2015 22:03:22]  <Calica> Trying to assert herself?  The comedy option that would be a pain in the butt to run is "assert herself to Noriko"
[14-Nov-2015 22:03:57]  <Rig> Yeah, no idea how to run that, but the core idea is good. Maybe asserting herself to her parents?
[14-Nov-2015 22:04:35]  <IllFlower> Are we on track to make Emiko kind of a smiling, grin-and-bear-it pushover?
[14-Nov-2015 22:04:57]  <IllFlower> She doesn't like being talked over, so that seems weirdly contradictory.
[14-Nov-2015 22:05:28]  <Calica> I was sort of pushing from high Ht, low Wl, but I dunno, maybe that sort of abstract bit should be pushed in another direction
[14-Nov-2015 22:06:23]  <IllFlower> Wl seems tuned to physical conflict more than this kind of social conflict.
[14-Nov-2015 22:07:08]  <Rig> How about she wants to be physically stronger?
[14-Nov-2015 22:07:30]  <Calica> IllFlower: hmm, true
[14-Nov-2015 22:07:38]  <IllFlower> Run faster, jump higher, etc., I threw it on the ground.
[14-Nov-2015 22:07:50]  <IllFlower> She wants to throw things on the ground.

[14-Nov-2015 22:27:30]  <Rig> I'm not sure how to play an initiation for "I hope I was the biggest smart-ass ever seen."
[14-Nov-2015 22:27:52]  <Calica> yeah, the treadmill is probably not possessed by demons, but I think I do like the idea of her trying to get physically stronger because she knows the track&field people etc.
[14-Nov-2015 22:28:48]  <IllFlower> She wants to be able to run (jog) a few laps around the track without stopping.

[14-Nov-2015 23:12:57]  <IllFlower> I have no dice, so I give.
[14-Nov-2015 23:13:15]  <IllFlower> Choose a 1d6 trait appropriate to the conclusion of this conflict!
[14-Nov-2015 23:13:23]  <IllFlower> Calica, you're next!
[14-Nov-2015 23:14:13]  <BGTB2005> 1d6 'Violence is not an acceptable answer'?
[14-Nov-2015 23:15:44]  <IllFlower> Works for me.
[14-Nov-2015 23:18:27]  <Calica> alright, so now it's time for Emiko to try to get stronger/more fit/etc?
[14-Nov-2015 23:19:19]  <IllFlower> Whatever you please.
[14-Nov-2015 23:19:42]  <Calica> I guess the question is, how do we start?
[14-Nov-2015 23:20:13]  <Rig> Raise against the exercise machine.
[14-Nov-2015 23:20:30]  <IllFlower> I was thinking Emiko was out on the track or something.
[14-Nov-2015 23:21:02]  <IllFlower> She wants to run 400 m without stopping, egged on by, say, Mayumi.
[14-Nov-2015 23:21:16]  <IllFlower> I play the role of the voice in her head telling her to stop.
[14-Nov-2015 23:24:26]  <Calica> okay
[14-Nov-2015 23:25:08]  <Calica> I'm guessing this is going to start out as a physical non-fighting, since she's just running on the track?
[14-Nov-2015 23:25:18]  <IllFlower> Yeah. I don't see how it could escalate much of anywhere.

[14-Nov-2015 23:25:39]  <IllFlower> Wow, that's crap.
[14-Nov-2015 23:26:00]  <IllFlower> Arguably you can roll in the relationship with Mayumi in the middle of the action if you feel it's appropriate to do so.
[14-Nov-2015 23:26:08]  <Calica> ok
[14-Nov-2015 23:26:10]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I think I'll start.
[14-Nov-2015 23:26:43]  <BGTB2005> ("You can do it, Emiko!" :D)
[14-Nov-2015 23:27:32]  <IllFlower> Right off the starting line, Emiko doesn't like the feeling in her shoes. Why did she let Mayumi talk her into this? She hadn't run on a track since elementary school, and even then she wasn't that great at it.

[14-Nov-2015 23:36:12]  <IllFlower> PUSH HARDER
[14-Nov-2015 23:36:55]  <Calica> Emiko pushes the aches out of her mind, continuing to run, thinking about the impressed looks on her friends who are in the track and field club when they hear that she did it.

[14-Nov-2015 23:46:08]  <Calica> But from back where she started, she can definitely hear something.  Sounds like Mayumi talking to one of the other track and field girls around.
[14-Nov-2015 23:46:32]  <Calica> (here'd be a place to add the die for Mayumi but it's kinda pointless at this point)
[14-Nov-2015 23:47:20]  <Calica> Mayumi was the one who egged her on to do this, she cares about her, and even someone else is around.

[14-Nov-2015 23:49:04]  <IllFlower> I'm going to quickly check on my laundry and then we'll finish up with Rig's initiation.

[15-Nov-2015 00:03:50]  <IllFlower> RIG YOU'RE UP
[15-Nov-2015 00:04:28]  <Rig> We were gonna go with convincing Takumi to let Noriko help, right?
[15-Nov-2015 00:05:01]  <IllFlower> I think so.
[15-Nov-2015 00:05:18]  <Calica> IllFlower: hm, yeah, maybe "Can push herself through pain" or is that a bit too strongly worded?
[15-Nov-2015 00:05:44]  <Rig> Do you want me to start?
[15-Nov-2015 00:05:50]  <IllFlower> So let's say it's been a long afternoon and Takumi and Noriko are the only ones left in the student council room. Takumi because of work, Noriko only partly because of work.
[15-Nov-2015 00:06:00]  <Rig> Works for me.
