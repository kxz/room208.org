She then looks around to see Emiko, again, having followed her to this park, with Satori behind her, kind of embarrassed about her presence.

@time=2016-02-07T21:37:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Well, she and Ruri have some of their own... circumstances," Chie says. She's obviously being deliberately vague.
