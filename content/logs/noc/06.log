@time=2016-01-10T01:03:19.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I think lumping us in with you is a bit much."
@time=2016-01-10T01:04:43.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"There's one difference.  We didn't send an exploding letter to a civilian(or some other setting-appropriate word)"
@time=2016-01-10T01:04:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It's not like I invented the concept of magical girls."
@time=2016-01-10T01:05:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Calica: "Perhaps, but I have no way of knowing if you've done something worse."
@time=2016-01-10T01:07:02.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And that's how you justify it?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:09:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"No, not at all. I have my own personal reasons for working with Akamine. I couldn't care less about his turf battles, but he has things that I need."
@time=2016-01-10T01:10:04.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What's that?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:10:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Satori remembers Akamine mentioning a Mr. Tamura.
@time=2016-01-10T01:10:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Some kind of persuasion? Probably not particularly nice persuasion.
@time=2016-01-10T01:11:25.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Is it something to do with Tamura?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:12:04.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Tamura?" Noriko asks. He was just an convenience store owner. What could this have to do with him?
@time=2016-01-10T01:12:20.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(("Tamura Gear!?"))
@time=2016-01-10T01:12:23.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :does Emiko know about Tamura? (question to be asked after every name)
@time=2016-01-10T01:12:50.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe Noriko mentioned him once or twice?(??)
@time=2016-01-10T01:13:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Go with your gut on this one.
@time=2016-01-10T01:14:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"He's part of it," Suzuhara says to Satori.
@time=2016-01-10T01:15:27.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Part of what?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:15:47.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko nods along. How could he be involved?
@time=2016-01-10T01:16:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm going to pretend Noriko said the "convenience store owner" thing aloud.
@time=2016-01-10T01:16:26.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Fine with me
@time=2016-01-10T01:17:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"He's not just a convenience store owner. I suspect he wants to keep a low profile, but you must have heard some of the stories about him."
@time=2016-01-10T01:18:15.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :we're getting into convenience store owners with dark secrets and probably mafia ties or something, this really is durarara
@time=2016-01-10T01:18:27.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha.
@time=2016-01-10T01:18:41.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(well okay I'm primarily thinking of the Russian Sushi guy but still)
@time=2016-01-10T01:19:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, has Noriko heard the rumors?
@time=2016-01-10T01:20:06.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I was trying to decide.
@time=2016-01-10T01:20:18.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Those are just rumors from stupid kids."
@time=2016-01-10T01:21:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Some of them are true.
@time=2016-01-10T01:21:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"He really does own about half of the real estate in this neighborhood.
@time=2016-01-10T01:22:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And he really has broken a few bones."
@time=2016-01-10T01:22:59.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(("People get into accidents all the time and he's getting on in years."))
@time=2016-01-10T01:23:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You know what I meant.
@time=2016-01-10T01:23:16.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :(("What does osteoporosis have to do with your scheming?"))
@time=2016-01-10T01:23:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Besides, stupid kids can't think of a story like Tamura's."
@time=2016-01-10T01:24:10.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"So, what? You're doing this for real estate? To get revenge?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:24:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The former, yes, after a way of speaking."
@time=2016-01-10T01:26:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Suzuhara looks at the ground.
@time=2016-01-10T01:27:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"If he knew, I don't know why it took this long for him to come around. He's worth billions of yen and he can't spare one apartment for a seventeen-year-old girl."
@time=2016-01-10T01:28:28.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"If he knew what?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:29:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"He knew why I was using Akamine. What I wanted from him. What I was getting away from."
@time=2016-01-10T01:30:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A slight wind picks up, blowing Suzuhara's hair over her eyes.
@time=2016-01-10T01:30:44.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :¬.¬
@time=2016-01-10T01:31:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hey, gotta play up the drama.
@time=2016-01-10T01:31:14.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What were you getting away from?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:31:34.000Z :ShowerAvenue NICK CentralAve
@time=2016-01-10T01:32:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I'd rather not say. Especially to someone who shut me in a box and hasn't bothered to tell me who she is."
@time=2016-01-10T01:32:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Okay, maybe she's a little annoyed at Satori.
@time=2016-01-10T01:34:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Not even Akamine knows. It would destroy any leverage I have."
@time=2016-01-10T01:35:15.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We can't let you go on attacking people for your selfish needs."
@time=2016-01-10T01:36:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You don't have to. That doesn't mean I won't keep doing what I feel I must."
@time=2016-01-10T01:38:38.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"If 'doing what you feel you must' means you keep hurting people, then I'm going to have to keep shutting you in boxes."
@time=2016-01-10T01:39:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She addresses Noriko. "I have a proposition, if you care for it."
@time=2016-01-10T01:39:40.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Propositions seem to be something I'm involved in a lot recently."
@time=2016-01-10T01:41:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Give me a week. Once the ink is dry on my contract with Mr. Tamura, we can destroy Akamine's outfit. I won't need him anymore, and I've actually grown to dislike him rather intensely."
@time=2016-01-10T01:41:37.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And in that week how many more people will get hurt?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:41:49.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And why should we believe you?  You are the one who did the dirty tricks with Mayumi."
@time=2016-01-10T01:41:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That's up to him. And to you."
@time=2016-01-10T01:44:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Suzuhara doesn't seem to have blinked in quite some time.
@time=2016-01-10T01:44:57.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I don't think that works for me. For us. You've twisted magic and used it against civilians for your own gain."
@time=2016-01-10T01:45:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Then what do you want?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:47:01.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"To stop you."
@time=2016-01-10T01:47:34.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Conflict?
@time=2016-01-10T01:48:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You don't want that. If that was all you wanted, you could stop now and nothing would be any different. But you don't trust me.
@time=2016-01-10T01:48:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You want to crush me underneath your heel and make me submit to you."
@time=2016-01-10T01:50:41.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko shakes her head, "Do you think I'm a mirror? Do I reflect your goal that you'll attack a girl for some juvenile Yakuza wannabe to accomplish?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:51:33.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What I want to do is protect those innocents from the ones that would wield magic for their own gain."
@time=2016-01-10T01:53:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Do you believe that what you're doing is right?"
@time=2016-01-10T01:53:57.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"We all want to believe that."
@time=2016-01-10T01:54:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Then we have more in common than you think."
@time=2016-01-10T01:54:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :If we're going to do conflict, I don't think you should wait for me to start it.
@time=2016-01-10T01:55:25.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I'm just not sure what the stakes would be beyond "prevent Suzuhara from continuing her plan"
@time=2016-01-10T01:55:42.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or if we want to do this conflict this session or jump into it next session.
@time=2016-01-10T01:55:54.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :personally, I want to know what she's running away from
@time=2016-01-10T01:56:02.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It seems like "apprehend her and keep her under watch" but who knows.
@time=2016-01-10T01:56:29.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, that's probably an okay stake.
@time=2016-01-10T01:57:18.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That okay with BGTB2005 and Calica?
@time=2016-01-10T01:57:27.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah
@time=2016-01-10T01:57:48.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I like the stake.  Not sure about doing a conflict this late in the session as opposed to the start of next but
@time=2016-01-10T01:57:55.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I figure we could learn more about her motivations once we've detained her
@time=2016-01-10T01:58:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shall we leave off here and conflict next session?
@time=2016-01-10T01:58:45.000Z :Iverum PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That works for me.
@time=2016-01-10T01:59:11.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :sounds good
@time=2016-01-10T01:59:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Then we'll pick up next week. Thanks for playing!
@time=2016-01-10T01:59:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :This is going to be *exciting*.
