[09-Jan-2016 21:31:16]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | RIGHT NOW: Novus Ordo Conservatorum
[09-Jan-2016 21:31:22]  <IllFlower> All right, let's eat.
[09-Jan-2016 21:31:29]  <IllFlower> Uh, I mean, get this game started.
[09-Jan-2016 21:31:58]  <IllFlower> Last time, we left off with Rei trying to burn a hole in Noriko's shoulder.
[09-Jan-2016 21:32:13]  <IllFlower> We came to an agreement that maybe we didn't want magic shooting.
[09-Jan-2016 21:32:54]  <IllFlower> So that raises the question: What *do* we want?
[09-Jan-2016 21:33:04]  *** Iverum <~Iverum@2602:306:37ff:ad48:fc7a:19a0:7fed:9793> has joined #madokamadness
[09-Jan-2016 21:33:24]  <Iverum> Sorry about that.
[09-Jan-2016 21:33:41]  <IllFlower> Reliable internet connections, apparently.
[09-Jan-2016 21:33:56]  <BGTB2005> maybe we could sort this out with a chat over tea and cookies?
[09-Jan-2016 21:35:11]  *** Rig <~Iverum@2602:306:37ff:ad40:c7f:7b28:3055:3468> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 198 seconds)
[09-Jan-2016 21:35:19]  <Iverum> Well, I think last time I was starting to agree that maybe just shooting her with magic would be appropriate.
[09-Jan-2016 21:35:38]  <IllFlower> We got a badass here.
[09-Jan-2016 21:36:14]  <Calica> Are we still near the school?
[09-Jan-2016 21:36:47]  <IllFlower> I imagine that's still an option.
[09-Jan-2016 21:37:00]  <IllFlower> I thought you folks were just standing outside the classroom door the whole time.
[09-Jan-2016 21:37:24]  <Iverum> Yeah, I think we are.
[09-Jan-2016 21:38:06]  <IllFlower> Well, it seems like you're all interested in confronting her, so the only question is how.
[09-Jan-2016 21:38:38]  <Iverum> Well, she seemed disinteresting in talking.
[09-Jan-2016 21:39:29]  <BGTB2005> maybe we could 'invite' her somewhere?
[09-Jan-2016 21:39:59]  <BGTB2005> and by invite I totally mean "kidnap"
[09-Jan-2016 21:40:03]  <Iverum> Maybe we should just let her move on and then come back to her later. Follow her or something?
[09-Jan-2016 21:41:01]  <Calica> follow her could work, yeah
[09-Jan-2016 21:41:28]  <IllFlower> What are you hoping to find out?
[09-Jan-2016 21:41:52]  <BGTB2005> where she lives?
[09-Jan-2016 21:41:54]  <Iverum> Where she's gotten these sorcerous powers from? If she has a cabal?
[09-Jan-2016 21:42:43]  <Iverum> A sorcerous cabal.
[09-Jan-2016 21:43:00]  <IllFlower> lol

[09-Jan-2016 21:43:54]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara's phone rings. She pulls it out from her school bag and glances at the screen impassively.
[09-Jan-2016 21:44:45]  <IllFlower> "I have to go," she says. "We can talk more about this later."
[09-Jan-2016 21:44:54]  <Iverum> https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fpaQpyU_QiM/hqdefault.jpg Rapidly beginning to picture her this way
[09-Jan-2016 21:44:55]  <Omnipresence> 14[i.ytimg.com] JPEG image (480 × 360 pixels, 10.2 KB)
[09-Jan-2016 21:45:36]  <Iverum> Noriko smiles, "That'd be good."
[09-Jan-2016 21:45:57]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara heads for the staircase for whatever engagement she has.
[09-Jan-2016 21:46:43]  <IllFlower> Hm, if you want to spy on her, maybe it's best if we pretend all three of you weren't just there with her.
[09-Jan-2016 21:46:59]  <Iverum> Who should be the spy then?
[09-Jan-2016 21:47:05]  <Iverum> I vote the weird religious one.
[09-Jan-2016 21:47:43]  <BGTB2005> sure
[09-Jan-2016 21:47:54]  <Calica> yeah, I don't think Satori's done much this campaign, and also she's probably more likely to be able to dismiss it as "just the weird religious one being weird", etc.
[09-Jan-2016 21:50:24]  <IllFlower> Noriko gives a small nod to Satori, firing a glance at the departing Suzuhara.
[09-Jan-2016 21:50:38]  <Iverum> Sneaky spy nods.
[09-Jan-2016 21:50:43]  <IllFlower> Satori nods back and starts following.
[09-Jan-2016 21:51:12]  <BGTB2005> Bd+Ht?
[09-Jan-2016 21:51:37]  <IllFlower> After a fair bit of walking, during which Suzuhara doesn't bother looking back even once, the two girls arrive at a tidy little café.
[09-Jan-2016 21:53:00]  <IllFlower> Akamine is already there. His presence is like the effect of a leather biker's jacket on top of a nice cocktail dress.
[09-Jan-2016 21:53:58]  <IllFlower> "Nice work," he says to Suzuhara as she arrives. She doesn't particularly acknowledge this comment and just heads straight for the table.
[09-Jan-2016 21:55:30]  <IllFlower> "I have no idea how you pulled that shit off, but the entire school's talking about it."
[09-Jan-2016 21:55:53]  <IllFlower> "I only did what I said I would," Suzuhara says.
[09-Jan-2016 21:56:47]  <IllFlower> "Can you show me the ropes? I can think of a bunch of other situations where a little bit of shock and awe would do the trick."
[09-Jan-2016 21:57:13]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara shakes her head. "It's not something I can teach."
[09-Jan-2016 21:59:01]  <IllFlower> "I see." Akamine laughs, seemingly a little nervous. "Well, anyway, we're counting on you for this one. I can only imagine what's going through Minase's head right now."
[09-Jan-2016 21:59:38]  <IllFlower> A grin. "If I could have been there when his girlfriend got set on fire..."
[09-Jan-2016 22:00:18]  <IllFlower> "I'm sure you would have enjoyed it," Suzuhara answers, somewhat coldly.
[09-Jan-2016 22:00:38]  <IllFlower> It looks like this particular conversation is beginning to peter out.
[09-Jan-2016 22:02:12]  *** Medicine <~Vick@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
[09-Jan-2016 22:02:38]  <Iverum> Well, that was moderately insightful.
[09-Jan-2016 22:02:55]  <BGTB2005> Clearly they need to be locked up
[09-Jan-2016 22:03:16]  <Iverum> I do not think the police would be terribly handy.
[09-Jan-2016 22:05:19]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara begins to get up to leave, after being there for so short a period of time that the café staff haven't even had a chance to ask her for an order.
[09-Jan-2016 22:05:23]  <Iverum> I dunno what we should do now. We have evidence that she's a sorcerer, but we don't have any way to really expose her to anyone.
[09-Jan-2016 22:05:35]  <BGTB2005> Locking them in a magical box sounds like it might be a good idea, but I'm doubting the wisdom of doing so in public
[09-Jan-2016 22:05:49]  <Iverum> Maybe just confronting her would be a decent move. She's only slightly likely to kill everyone.
[09-Jan-2016 22:06:27]  <IllFlower> "Oh," Akamine says, "about that thing that you wanted. We finally convinced Tamura to let go of that place. It'll be all yours in a week or so."
[09-Jan-2016 22:07:07]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara stops. "Is that so? Thank you." Then unstops.
[09-Jan-2016 22:07:21]  <Iverum> Unstoppag.
[09-Jan-2016 22:07:22]  <Iverum> *e
[09-Jan-2016 22:08:33]  <IllFlower> If Satori's gonna do something, might want to do it now.
[09-Jan-2016 22:08:35]  <BGTB2005> Watching Suzuhara, Satori whispers an incantation to magically seal the exit
[09-Jan-2016 22:08:48]  <BGTB2005> probably not the best of ideas, but :V
[09-Jan-2016 22:08:55]  <Iverum> Amusing though.
[09-Jan-2016 22:08:58]  <IllFlower> Ooh, this sounds like a conflict.
[09-Jan-2016 22:09:03]  <Iverum> It does.
[09-Jan-2016 22:09:11]  <Calica> yeah, that's conflict material for sure
[09-Jan-2016 22:10:09]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara pushes on the door, but it doesn't budge. The bell attached to it clanks around loudly.
[09-Jan-2016 22:10:39]  <IllFlower> One of the café staff comes over to try and help, but doesn't get much of anywhere.
[09-Jan-2016 22:11:02]  <Iverum> Too bad it's not a cat cafe.
[09-Jan-2016 22:11:44]  <IllFlower> Something seems to dawn on Suzuhara. She lifts her head, stares into space for a second, then turns around and looks directly at Satori.
[09-Jan-2016 22:12:50]  <IllFlower> Well, I have something at stake now: getting out of this frickin' shop.
[09-Jan-2016 22:13:10]  <Calica> oh boy
[09-Jan-2016 22:13:46]  <IllFlower> Shall we conflict.
[09-Jan-2016 22:13:58]  <BGTB2005> sure
[09-Jan-2016 22:13:59]  <IllFlower> I meant that as a question, but eh.
[09-Jan-2016 22:14:07]  <IllFlower> I just need something from you.
[09-Jan-2016 22:14:19]  <IllFlower> Maybe just "detain her for long enough to do something follow-up."
[09-Jan-2016 22:14:41]  <BGTB2005> Detain her long enough for backup
[09-Jan-2016 22:14:48]  <BGTB2005> to arrive
[09-Jan-2016 22:14:56]  <Iverum> Raise: Rapidly texts Noriko and Emiko on line.
[09-Jan-2016 22:15:05]  <Iverum> Sends them a sad Homura sticker.

[09-Jan-2016 22:22:17]  <Iverum> I can only imagine Satori seeing that by ordering a coffee.
[09-Jan-2016 22:22:21]  <BGTB2005> "It's not locked."

[09-Jan-2016 22:26:41]  <BGTB2005> I so want to roll for "Violence is not an acceptable answer", but I'm not sure if it's relevant enough to my raise
[09-Jan-2016 22:27:09]  <IllFlower> That seems like it's supposed to apply to situations where Satori would use violence, not someone else.

[09-Jan-2016 22:30:14]  <BGTB2005> It's technically unlocked; there's just a magical barrier preventing it from being opened

[09-Jan-2016 22:39:41]  <Calica> didn't Ayako throw someone out of a cafe window
[09-Jan-2016 22:39:44]  <BGTB2005> would not be the first dining establishment we contributed to destroying

[09-Jan-2016 22:48:04]  <Iverum> True.
[09-Jan-2016 22:48:38]  <IllFlower> Either that or, since they're locked in a room together, an unexpected diversion into yuri. This sort of thing happens a lot.
[09-Jan-2016 22:49:21]  <Iverum> Can you escalate to yuri?
[09-Jan-2016 22:49:38]  <Calica> if not, we should make a ditv hack that can
[09-Jan-2016 22:49:45]  <BGTB2005> I don't see why it wouldn't be an option?

[09-Jan-2016 23:01:55]  <Iverum> I think so.
[09-Jan-2016 23:03:07]  <IllFlower> I dunno if that *really* counts. Unless the magical box starts attacking her.
[09-Jan-2016 23:03:16]  <IllFlower> Probably more a physical thing.

[09-Jan-2016 23:15:26]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara notices the barrier closing around her, though to all of the café's patrons, it looks as if she's reacting to something that's not there.

[09-Jan-2016 23:18:17]  <IllFlower> "Hardly an excuse to squeeze someone to death," Suzuhara says.
[09-Jan-2016 23:20:58]  <IllFlower> Iverum: That was what was at stake, so yes.
[09-Jan-2016 23:21:43]  <BGTB2005> "I wasn't going to. You're dangerous and you need to be stopped, but I don't want to hurt anyone."
[09-Jan-2016 23:22:00]  <Calica> so presumably Emiko and Noriko are going to arrive on the scene soon?
[09-Jan-2016 23:22:48]  <IllFlower> "Where was I going to go, once you'd already locked the door?"
[09-Jan-2016 23:23:33]  <Iverum> Emiko and Noriko can just show up outside the door and be super confused.
[09-Jan-2016 23:25:48]  <BGTB2005> "The door was never locked."
[09-Jan-2016 23:26:05]  <Iverum> There is no spoon.
[09-Jan-2016 23:26:53]  <Iverum> Emiko and Noriko run up outside the cafe and try to enter only to find themselves blocked out.
[09-Jan-2016 23:27:52]  <IllFlower> "You haven't answered my question. But never mind that.
[09-Jan-2016 23:28:09]  <IllFlower> "What motivates you to keep me here, if not wanting to hurt me?"
[09-Jan-2016 23:28:35]  *** Xeniera <~Xen@usc-secure-wireless-088-134.usc.edu> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving.)
[09-Jan-2016 23:29:23]  *** Xeniera <~Xen@usc-secure-wireless-088-134.usc.edu> has joined #madokamadness

[09-Jan-2016 23:32:00]  <BGTB2005> "Stopping you from going out and hurting other people."
[09-Jan-2016 23:33:09]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara looks blankly at Satori.
[09-Jan-2016 23:33:31]  <IllFlower> "I see I won't be getting much of anywhere with you."
[09-Jan-2016 23:34:00]  <IllFlower> Good timing, then, for Noriko and Emiko to arrive on the scene.
[09-Jan-2016 23:36:24]  <Iverum> Well, she's not leaving, I guess.
[09-Jan-2016 23:37:03]  <IllFlower> I think Satori's no longer blocking the door.
[09-Jan-2016 23:37:12]  <IllFlower> As far as I know it's pretty much Suzuhara in a box.
[09-Jan-2016 23:39:28]  <Iverum> Noriko enters the cafe, glancing between Suzuhara and Satori. The employee who had been trying to open the door appears unsure of whether to greet them or flee.
[09-Jan-2016 23:40:22]  <Iverum> Akamine is pretty quiet.
[09-Jan-2016 23:41:17]  <Iverum> "Satori?"
[09-Jan-2016 23:41:33]  <BGTB2005> "Yes?"
[09-Jan-2016 23:43:03]  <Iverum> Noriko tries to phrase the question. This was not quite the covert action she was thinking of.
[09-Jan-2016 23:43:17]  <IllFlower> hahahahaha
[09-Jan-2016 23:43:37]  <IllFlower> For one, she was hoping it would actually be covert.
[09-Jan-2016 23:44:12]  <Calica> "Are you sure now about Suzuhara being involved?"
[09-Jan-2016 23:44:29]  <Iverum> Yeah, don't know if I want Noriko to be like "Why is Suzuhara trapped in a magic box? What is the plan here?"
[09-Jan-2016 23:48:51]  <Iverum> Just gonna stick with Emiko's question while Noriko fumbles for a goal.
[09-Jan-2016 23:50:26]  <BGTB2005> "I'm sure. She placed the letter bomb in Mayumi's locker."
[09-Jan-2016 23:51:11]  <Iverum> This is where Satori reveals she recorded the conversation and we can get Suzuhara expelled.
[09-Jan-2016 23:51:43]  <IllFlower> They didn't really say much that was incriminating. Maybe circumstantially.
[09-Jan-2016 23:51:59]  <Iverum> True.
[09-Jan-2016 23:52:11]  <Calica> "Do we have a confession?"
[09-Jan-2016 23:56:42]  <BGTB2005> Satori thinks about Suzuhara's chat with Akamine. "Um..."
[10-Jan-2016 00:00:11]  <Iverum> Noriko sighs. "What do we do now?"
[10-Jan-2016 00:01:03]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara looks at Noriko. "I'd like to know as well."
[10-Jan-2016 00:01:18]  <IllFlower> Her face is sour, as if realizing that she'd made a preventable mistake.
[10-Jan-2016 00:01:46]  <Iverum> "At least we're on the same page, right?"
[10-Jan-2016 00:03:04]  <IllFlower> "I don't know how I feel about that."
[10-Jan-2016 00:04:42]  <Iverum> Can we pause for like 15 minutes while I walk my dog?
[10-Jan-2016 00:05:00]  <IllFlower> We've been pretty slow as it is, so I don't see why not...
[10-Jan-2016 00:05:19]  <Iverum> Cool. Hopefully we can decide what to do when I get back, since I have no idea.
[10-Jan-2016 00:05:46]  <BGTB2005> ...order some tea and cookies and chat?
[10-Jan-2016 00:09:28]  <IllFlower> We're really going for the whiplash strategy of breaking our suspect, huh?
[10-Jan-2016 00:09:52]  <IllFlower> "Jesus CHRIST what do you WANT I don't even know anymore goddammit"
[10-Jan-2016 00:13:45]  <BGTB2005> I don't know if /we/ even know what we want
[10-Jan-2016 00:13:54]  <BGTB2005> I don't know if we ever knew what we wanted
[10-Jan-2016 00:14:28]  <IllFlower> Uh, let's not have a meaning-of-life conversation right now...
[10-Jan-2016 00:14:38]  <IllFlower> Seriously, though, what's the objective?
[10-Jan-2016 00:14:51]  <IllFlower> Justice? Revenge? Sadism?
[10-Jan-2016 00:16:05]  <Calica> I thought it was something like getting her to confess so she'd be punished by the school?
[10-Jan-2016 00:16:28]  <BGTB2005> I think that may have been the original plan?
[10-Jan-2016 00:19:58]  <IllFlower> And we're doing that how?
[10-Jan-2016 00:20:27]  <BGTB2005> I think this is the '???' step of our plan
[10-Jan-2016 00:20:54]  <Calica> I mean, we've got her trapped, and Satori has heard some stuff
[10-Jan-2016 00:21:03]  <Calica> and Noriko got burned
[10-Jan-2016 00:22:58]  <Calica> part of me thinks we could threaten her but dunno
[10-Jan-2016 00:23:41]  <Iverum> Part of me thinks Noriko knows she dangerous and needs to be eliminated somehow.
[10-Jan-2016 00:23:42]  <BGTB2005> sounds like a job for Noriko
[10-Jan-2016 00:24:14]  <Iverum> But I don't know if a cafe is the appropriately place to start threatening a student.
[10-Jan-2016 00:25:24]  <Calica> it worked for Ayako
[10-Jan-2016 00:25:46]  <Iverum> 'Worked'
[10-Jan-2016 00:26:06]  <BGTB2005> go for it :V
[10-Jan-2016 00:27:52]  <IllFlower> Wow, so much threatening going on here.
[10-Jan-2016 00:31:24]  <Iverum> "Suzuhara, you and Akamine obviously targeted Minase. You need to own up for what you did."
[10-Jan-2016 00:32:47]  <Calica> "Specifically, what you did to Mayumi, who wasn't involved."
[10-Jan-2016 00:34:02]  <IllFlower> Akamine is sitting in the back watching the goings-on with mild shock.
[10-Jan-2016 00:34:15]  <IllFlower> He hasn't known anyone to talk to Suzuhara like that.
[10-Jan-2016 00:35:04]  <IllFlower> "I don't see any benefit to doing so," she says.
[10-Jan-2016 00:35:26]  <Iverum> "Easing your conscious?"
[10-Jan-2016 00:35:51]  <Calica> conscience?
[10-Jan-2016 00:36:06]  <Iverum> Yeah.
[10-Jan-2016 00:40:30]  <IllFlower> "Do you expect that to actually work?"
[10-Jan-2016 00:41:09]  <BGTB2005> ("...Yes?")
[10-Jan-2016 00:43:43]  <Iverum> Should we engage in some kind of conflict? Like, making her confess or something? Though I honestly have no idea how to raise in that conflict beyond being like "Yeah, you should tell us, please."
[10-Jan-2016 00:44:20]  *** CentralAve is now known as ShowerAvenue
[10-Jan-2016 00:44:37]  <Calica> yeah I'm in the same place.  maybe take advantage of the box
[10-Jan-2016 00:45:01]  <Iverum> Just crush Suzuhara in an invisible box in the middle of a cafe.
[10-Jan-2016 00:45:03]  <Iverum> That'd work.

[10-Jan-2016 00:47:49]  <Iverum> "That seems like a reasonable choice."
[10-Jan-2016 00:47:59]  <IllFlower> "Akamine will be confused if we keep going here, at the very least.
[10-Jan-2016 00:48:20]  <IllFlower> "In the worst case, heavily traumatized. I hope it doesn't come to that."
[10-Jan-2016 00:48:23]  <BGTB2005> lol who cares about him
[10-Jan-2016 00:48:49]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara knocks against the barrier. It sounds like wood.
[10-Jan-2016 00:49:02]  <IllFlower> "It's not like I can go anywhere you don't want me to go."
[10-Jan-2016 00:49:38]  <IllFlower> Emiko is beginning to wish she could wipe the memory of all the other people in the café right about now.
[10-Jan-2016 00:50:18]  <Iverum> Well, where should we do this? Spooky trainyard?
[10-Jan-2016 00:50:25]  <BGTB2005> Satori looks to the other two
[10-Jan-2016 00:50:27]  <BGTB2005> sure
[10-Jan-2016 00:50:59]  <IllFlower> Not just, like, some out-of-the-way part of a park somewhere?
[10-Jan-2016 00:51:06]  <IllFlower> You're all-in on the aesthetic, huh.
[10-Jan-2016 00:51:12]  <Iverum> That works too.
[10-Jan-2016 00:51:34]  <BGTB2005> I'm quite fond of the trainyard
[10-Jan-2016 00:52:03]  <IllFlower> The Conservators leave the café, their suspect in tow.
[10-Jan-2016 00:52:07]  <Calica> the trainyard fight was nice but we just need someplace out of the way enough
[10-Jan-2016 00:52:32]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara walks very gingerly, careful to avoid smacking her knees against the by now very narrow barrier.
[10-Jan-2016 00:53:19]  <IllFlower> You could hear a pin drop in the café, let alone the bell on the door tinkling as the four of them exit.
[10-Jan-2016 00:53:45]  <Iverum> Super awkward.
[10-Jan-2016 00:54:24]  <IllFlower> Without an explicit decision, Noriko leads the group to a dense stand of trees in the middle of a nearby park.
[10-Jan-2016 00:54:58]  <Calica> how is Emiko going to explain that to everyone
[10-Jan-2016 00:55:40]  <IllFlower> "How long are you planning on keeping me in here?" Suzuhara asks.
[10-Jan-2016 00:56:01]  <Iverum> Noriko looks to Satori.
[10-Jan-2016 00:57:00]  <BGTB2005> Satori dispels the barriers
[10-Jan-2016 00:57:36]  *** Lin_Chong <~Kevin@116.87.39.204> has joined #madokamadness
[10-Jan-2016 00:57:40]  <Iverum> Now we all fight to the death.
[10-Jan-2016 00:57:50]  <IllFlower> "That answers that. Thank you. I was starting to feel a bit lightheaded."
[10-Jan-2016 00:59:31]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara takes a deep breath. "I see I picked the wrong girl to try and dissuade from getting involved," she says, looking at Noriko.
[10-Jan-2016 01:00:06]  <Calica> how much will the average magical girl/sorceror/etc know about conservators?
[10-Jan-2016 01:00:26]  <IllFlower> Time to find out!
[10-Jan-2016 01:00:42]  <Iverum> "I told you the proper authorities would handle it. That means us, apostate(or some other word that is more appropriate for setting)."
[10-Jan-2016 01:01:18]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara smiles. "That you did."
[10-Jan-2016 01:02:54]  <IllFlower> She looks at the three Conservators in turn. "I was under the impression that I was the only one in the whole school. I must have come to that conclusion last year."
[10-Jan-2016 01:03:19]  <Iverum> "I think lumping us in with you is a bit much."
[10-Jan-2016 01:04:43]  <Calica> "There's one difference.  We didn't send an exploding letter to a civilian(or some other setting-appropriate word)"
[10-Jan-2016 01:04:45]  <IllFlower> "It's not like I invented the concept of magical girls."
[10-Jan-2016 01:05:40]  <IllFlower> Calica: "Perhaps, but I have no way of knowing if you've done something worse."
[10-Jan-2016 01:07:02]  <Iverum> "And that's how you justify it?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:09:29]  <IllFlower> "No, not at all. I have my own personal reasons for working with Akamine. I couldn't care less about his turf battles, but he has things that I need."
[10-Jan-2016 01:10:04]  <Iverum> "What's that?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:10:27]  <IllFlower> Satori remembers Akamine mentioning a Mr. Tamura.
[10-Jan-2016 01:10:40]  <IllFlower> Some kind of persuasion? Probably not particularly nice persuasion.
[10-Jan-2016 01:11:25]  <BGTB2005> "Is it something to do with Tamura?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:12:04]  <Iverum> "Tamura?" Noriko asks. He was just an convenience store owner. What could this have to do with him?
[10-Jan-2016 01:12:20]  <Iverum> (("Tamura Gear!?"))
[10-Jan-2016 01:12:23]  <Calica> does Emiko know about Tamura? (question to be asked after every name)
[10-Jan-2016 01:12:50]  <BGTB2005> Maybe Noriko mentioned him once or twice?(??)
[10-Jan-2016 01:13:14]  <IllFlower> Go with your gut on this one.
[10-Jan-2016 01:14:50]  <IllFlower> "He's part of it," Suzuhara says to Satori.
[10-Jan-2016 01:15:27]  <Calica> "Part of what?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:15:47]  <Iverum> Noriko nods along. How could he be involved?
[10-Jan-2016 01:16:14]  <IllFlower> I'm going to pretend Noriko said the "convenience store owner" thing aloud.
[10-Jan-2016 01:16:26]  <Iverum> Fine with me
[10-Jan-2016 01:17:27]  <IllFlower> "He's not just a convenience store owner. I suspect he wants to keep a low profile, but you must have heard some of the stories about him."
[10-Jan-2016 01:18:15]  <Calica> we're getting into convenience store owners with dark secrets and probably mafia ties or something, this really is durarara
[10-Jan-2016 01:18:27]  <Iverum> Hahaha.
[10-Jan-2016 01:18:41]  <Calica> (well okay I'm primarily thinking of the Russian Sushi guy but still)
[10-Jan-2016 01:19:59]  <IllFlower> Well, has Noriko heard the rumors?
[10-Jan-2016 01:20:06]  <Iverum> I was trying to decide.
[10-Jan-2016 01:20:18]  <Iverum> "Those are just rumors from stupid kids."
[10-Jan-2016 01:21:14]  <IllFlower> "Some of them are true.
[10-Jan-2016 01:21:42]  <IllFlower> "He really does own about half of the real estate in this neighborhood.
[10-Jan-2016 01:22:02]  <IllFlower> "And he really has broken a few bones."
[10-Jan-2016 01:22:59]  <Iverum> (("People get into accidents all the time and he's getting on in years."))
[10-Jan-2016 01:23:12]  <IllFlower> You know what I meant.
[10-Jan-2016 01:23:16]  <Iverum> (("What does osteoporosis have to do with your scheming?"))
[10-Jan-2016 01:23:51]  <IllFlower> "Besides, stupid kids can't think of a story like Tamura's."
[10-Jan-2016 01:24:10]  <Iverum> "So, what? You're doing this for real estate? To get revenge?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:24:44]  <IllFlower> "The former, yes, after a way of speaking."
[10-Jan-2016 01:26:19]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara looks at the ground.
[10-Jan-2016 01:27:36]  <IllFlower> "If he knew, I don't know why it took this long for him to come around. He's worth billions of yen and he can't spare one apartment for a seventeen-year-old girl."
[10-Jan-2016 01:28:28]  <Calica> "If he knew what?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:29:36]  <IllFlower> "He knew why I was using Akamine. What I wanted from him. What I was getting away from."
[10-Jan-2016 01:30:19]  <IllFlower> A slight wind picks up, blowing Suzuhara's hair over her eyes.
[10-Jan-2016 01:30:44]  <Iverum> ¬.¬
[10-Jan-2016 01:31:09]  <IllFlower> Hey, gotta play up the drama.
[10-Jan-2016 01:31:14]  <BGTB2005> "What were you getting away from?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:31:34]  *** ShowerAvenue is now known as CentralAve
[10-Jan-2016 01:32:19]  <IllFlower> "I'd rather not say. Especially to someone who shut me in a box and hasn't bothered to tell me who she is."
[10-Jan-2016 01:32:50]  <IllFlower> Okay, maybe she's a little annoyed at Satori.
[10-Jan-2016 01:34:02]  <IllFlower> "Not even Akamine knows. It would destroy any leverage I have."
[10-Jan-2016 01:35:15]  <Iverum> "We can't let you go on attacking people for your selfish needs."
[10-Jan-2016 01:36:21]  <IllFlower> "You don't have to. That doesn't mean I won't keep doing what I feel I must."
[10-Jan-2016 01:38:38]  <BGTB2005> "If 'doing what you feel you must' means you keep hurting people, then I'm going to have to keep shutting you in boxes."
[10-Jan-2016 01:39:08]  <IllFlower> She addresses Noriko. "I have a proposition, if you care for it."
[10-Jan-2016 01:39:40]  <Iverum> "Propositions seem to be something I'm involved in a lot recently."
[10-Jan-2016 01:41:04]  <IllFlower> "Give me a week. Once the ink is dry on my contract with Mr. Tamura, we can destroy Akamine's outfit. I won't need him anymore, and I've actually grown to dislike him rather intensely."
[10-Jan-2016 01:41:37]  <Iverum> "And in that week how many more people will get hurt?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:41:49]  <Calica> "And why should we believe you?  You are the one who did the dirty tricks with Mayumi."
[10-Jan-2016 01:41:58]  <IllFlower> "That's up to him. And to you."
[10-Jan-2016 01:44:55]  <IllFlower> Suzuhara doesn't seem to have blinked in quite some time.
[10-Jan-2016 01:44:57]  <Iverum> "I don't think that works for me. For us. You've twisted magic and used it against civilians for your own gain."
[10-Jan-2016 01:45:49]  <IllFlower> "Then what do you want?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:47:01]  <Iverum> "To stop you."
[10-Jan-2016 01:47:34]  <Iverum> Conflict?
[10-Jan-2016 01:48:04]  <IllFlower> "You don't want that. If that was all you wanted, you could stop now and nothing would be any different. But you don't trust me.
[10-Jan-2016 01:48:19]  <IllFlower> "You want to crush me underneath your heel and make me submit to you."
[10-Jan-2016 01:50:41]  <Iverum> Noriko shakes her head, "Do you think I'm a mirror? Do I reflect your goal that you'll attack a girl for some juvenile Yakuza wannabe to accomplish?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:51:33]  <Iverum> "What I want to do is protect those innocents from the ones that would wield magic for their own gain."
[10-Jan-2016 01:53:29]  <IllFlower> "Do you believe that what you're doing is right?"
[10-Jan-2016 01:53:57]  <Iverum> "We all want to believe that."
[10-Jan-2016 01:54:28]  <IllFlower> "Then we have more in common than you think."
[10-Jan-2016 01:54:50]  <IllFlower> If we're going to do conflict, I don't think you should wait for me to start it.
[10-Jan-2016 01:55:25]  <Iverum> Yeah, I'm just not sure what the stakes would be beyond "prevent Suzuhara from continuing her plan"
[10-Jan-2016 01:55:42]  <Iverum> Or if we want to do this conflict this session or jump into it next session.
[10-Jan-2016 01:55:54]  <BGTB2005> personally, I want to know what she's running away from
[10-Jan-2016 01:56:02]  <IllFlower> It seems like "apprehend her and keep her under watch" but who knows.
[10-Jan-2016 01:56:29]  <Iverum> Yeah, that's probably an okay stake.
[10-Jan-2016 01:57:18]  <Iverum> That okay with BGTB2005 and Calica?
[10-Jan-2016 01:57:27]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[10-Jan-2016 01:57:48]  <Calica> I like the stake.  Not sure about doing a conflict this late in the session as opposed to the start of next but
[10-Jan-2016 01:57:55]  <BGTB2005> I figure we could learn more about her motivations once we've detained her
[10-Jan-2016 01:58:34]  <IllFlower> Shall we leave off here and conflict next session?
[10-Jan-2016 01:58:45]  <Iverum> That works for me.
[10-Jan-2016 01:59:11]  <BGTB2005> sounds good
[10-Jan-2016 01:59:24]  <IllFlower> Then we'll pick up next week. Thanks for playing!
[10-Jan-2016 01:59:29]  <IllFlower> This is going to be *exciting*.
