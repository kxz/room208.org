[07-Feb-2016 21:01:06]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | RIGHT NOW: The New School (no, not that one)
[07-Feb-2016 21:01:59]  <IllFlower> When we left our heroes, they were busy not really convincing Ruri Suzuhara that they were trustworthy.
[07-Feb-2016 21:02:30]  <IllFlower> Especially Noriko, who was at home doing schoolwork.
[07-Feb-2016 21:02:55]  <Rig> The least trustworthy activity.
[07-Feb-2016 21:03:03]  <IllFlower> I think we left off with an inclination to put the screws to Satori's sister.
[07-Feb-2016 21:03:13]  <IllFlower> Poor girl. What did she ever do to deserve screws?
[07-Feb-2016 21:03:14]  <Rig> If by screws you mean cookies.
[07-Feb-2016 21:03:33]  <Calica> Are any of the Girl Scout cookies screw-shaped?
[07-Feb-2016 21:04:02]  <IllFlower> http://www.amazon.com/Tool-Cookie-Cutter-Set/dp/B002VBNV5C # Maybe with one of these?
[07-Feb-2016 21:04:02]  <Omnipresence> 14[www.amazon.com] Amazon.com: R & M Tool Cookie Cutter Set: Kitchen & Dining
[07-Feb-2016 21:04:32]  <IllFlower> Anyway, is that still the plan?
[07-Feb-2016 21:05:06]  <Calica> I think talking to Satori's sister's the plan, yeah.
[07-Feb-2016 21:05:08]  <Rig> I don't see why it shouldn't be.
[07-Feb-2016 21:05:53]  <IllFlower> So, the scene right now is still Ruri, Chie, and Emiko awkwardly not talking to each other in the middle of a diner, while Satori tries her best to not be seen.
[07-Feb-2016 21:06:21]  <Calica> I thought Ruri walked away
[07-Feb-2016 21:06:32]  <Calica> or wait no, she just clammed up
[07-Feb-2016 21:06:52]  <IllFlower> Not everyone's as bad as the player characters with abruptness. ;)
[07-Feb-2016 21:07:18]  <Rig> At least we haven't started stealing everything in shops yet.
[07-Feb-2016 21:07:36]  <IllFlower> Was that something that was under consideration?
[07-Feb-2016 21:07:44]  <Calica> Nah, just a thing that PCs do
[07-Feb-2016 21:08:36]  <BGT|Mobile> I'm pretty sure it was an idea in a previous campaign 
[07-Feb-2016 21:08:50]  <Calica> nah, in the previous campaign we just threw people out of windows in diners
[07-Feb-2016 21:09:52]  <Calica> anyways I was thinking that maybe we should have Emiko do the "Nice to meet you" departure thing and then skip forward to when Chie would be able to talk
[07-Feb-2016 21:10:50]  <IllFlower> You can go ahead and jump out to the next scene if you want.
[07-Feb-2016 21:11:03]  <BGT|Mobile> I was thinking skipping to the next day after school 
[07-Feb-2016 21:11:35]  <IllFlower> That's a long time...
[07-Feb-2016 21:11:47]  <IllFlower> Who knows, if you wait that long, someone might get shot.
[07-Feb-2016 21:11:53]  <Calica> I was thinking after dinner at Satori's home but I didn't know how BGT|Mobile wanted to do it wrt having Emiko/Noriko there
[07-Feb-2016 21:12:40]  <IllFlower> Or Emiko could be real subtle and collar Chie all the way to a park somewhere.
[07-Feb-2016 21:13:13]  <BGT|Mobile> A meetup at a park sounds good
[07-Feb-2016 21:14:04]  <IllFlower> Subtle.
[07-Feb-2016 21:15:07]  <IllFlower> So, who wants to set this up?
[07-Feb-2016 21:15:42]  <Calica> I'll do it if nobody else really wants to
[07-Feb-2016 21:16:21]  <Rig> Go for it.
[07-Feb-2016 21:17:04]  <IllFlower> Do it even if someone else really wants to.
[07-Feb-2016 21:17:08]  <IllFlower> Fight! Fight!
[07-Feb-2016 21:17:29]  <IllFlower> Meanwhile I'm going to take a couple of minutes to fold my laundry.
[07-Feb-2016 21:20:55]  <Calica> After a short chat with Satori about Chie's likely route home and an exchange of texts with Noriko, Chie notices someone running to cross her path as she walks across a public park as a shortcut home.  She then looks around to see Emiko, again, having followed her to this park, with Satori behind her, kind of embarrassed about her presence.
[07-Feb-2016 21:22:06]  <IllFlower> Chie rolls her eyes.
[07-Feb-2016 21:22:15]  <Rig> Hahaha. Just like cutting her off in the park?
[07-Feb-2016 21:22:18]  <IllFlower> "I knew something was up," she says as the other two approach.
[07-Feb-2016 21:22:42]  <Calica> Rig: Something like that, yeah.  Blunt, but it's the first thing that came to mind.
[07-Feb-2016 21:24:00]  <IllFlower> "If you needed to talk to me, why didn't you just ask? I'm your little sister."
[07-Feb-2016 21:25:07]  <IllFlower> She gives Emiko a sheepish look. "Sorry she dragged you into this."
[07-Feb-2016 21:30:32]  <Calica> "It's... we're trying to figure out what Suzuhara is even planning."
[07-Feb-2016 21:31:18]  <IllFlower> "Ruri?"
[07-Feb-2016 21:31:45]  <Calica> "Her sister."
[07-Feb-2016 21:32:09]  <IllFlower> "Rei?"
[07-Feb-2016 21:33:14]  <IllFlower> Chie looks at Satori. "I didn't know you knew her."
[07-Feb-2016 21:35:53]  <BGT|Mobile> "I don't really know her."
[07-Feb-2016 21:36:21]  <IllFlower> Another funny look.
[07-Feb-2016 21:37:44]  <IllFlower> "Well, she and Ruri have some of their own... circumstances," Chie says. She's obviously being deliberately vague.
[07-Feb-2016 21:38:31]  <Calica> "Circumstances?"
[07-Feb-2016 21:38:34]  <Calica> ("Metal Gear?")
[07-Feb-2016 21:40:31]  <IllFlower> "It's not really my place to talk about them. Why didn't you ask Suzuhara herself, when you were back in the restaurant?"
[07-Feb-2016 21:40:48]  <Calica> "She didn't seem to want to talk to me that much."
[07-Feb-2016 21:40:54]  <IllFlower> PRESS F TO CONFLICT subtly appears on the screen.
[07-Feb-2016 21:41:21]  <Calica> Noriko quieter than I'd expect her to be, as well
[07-Feb-2016 21:42:05]  <IllFlower> Is she even there?
[07-Feb-2016 21:42:13]  <Calica> In the scene I set she was.
[07-Feb-2016 21:42:40]  <Rig> She was?
[07-Feb-2016 21:42:46]  <Rig> Oh, I didn't see.
[07-Feb-2016 21:43:00]  <Calica> Oh, I didn't mention it was Noriko crossing her path, whoops, lol
[07-Feb-2016 21:43:24]  <Rig> Yeah. Sorry, missed the cues.
[07-Feb-2016 21:44:33]  <IllFlower> Chie needs to be even more suspicious, then...
[07-Feb-2016 21:44:52]  <Rig> Noriko leans to Emiko and whispers, "Maybe circumstances with Mr. Tamura and short selling?"
[07-Feb-2016 21:45:02]  <IllFlower> "And who's the other girl?" she asks, indicating Noriko with a nod.
[07-Feb-2016 21:45:37]  <Calica> "This is Noriko.  She's a friend of ours."
[07-Feb-2016 21:45:41]  <Rig> "The other girl?" Noriko thinks to herself.
[07-Feb-2016 21:46:06]  <IllFlower> "Uh... huh."
[07-Feb-2016 21:46:15]  <IllFlower> PRESS F TO CONFLICT flahes up again.
[07-Feb-2016 21:46:34]  * Rig tries to find the F key on his Xbone controller.
[07-Feb-2016 21:46:41]  <Calica> f
[07-Feb-2016 21:47:03]  <Calica> (everything becomes it)
[07-Feb-2016 21:47:23]  <BGT|Mobile> F
[07-Feb-2016 21:47:56]  <IllFlower> Please enter the stakes:
[07-Feb-2016 21:48:26]  <Calica> Presumably to get her to open up about what she knows about the Suzuharas, unless someone has a better idea
[07-Feb-2016 21:48:27]  <IllFlower> I can't be the only one who reads "Xbone" as "X-bone."
[07-Feb-2016 21:48:58]  <Calica> Does anyone not, other than perhaps Microsoft's marketing department?
[07-Feb-2016 21:49:01]  <Rig> To foster sibling understanding.
[07-Feb-2016 21:49:09]  <IllFlower> Persuade her to spill?
[07-Feb-2016 21:49:32]  <BGT|Mobile> That's what I was thinking 
[07-Feb-2016 21:49:56]  <IllFlower> And who'll be doing the tipping over?
[07-Feb-2016 21:51:04]  <Calica> It could be all three of us but that'd be a bit lopsided
[07-Feb-2016 21:51:54]  <IllFlower> Like that's stopped you from browbeating others before. :p
[07-Feb-2016 21:52:05]  <IllFlower> No, yes, I agree.
[07-Feb-2016 21:52:41]  <Rig> I mean, Satori could sit out because she doesn't really want to strong-arm her sister.
[07-Feb-2016 21:54:26]  <IllFlower> The way this scene is going, Emiko would be most suited to this.
[07-Feb-2016 21:54:38]  <IllFlower> If you want to minmax, however, I think that's Noriko's job...
[07-Feb-2016 21:55:06]  <Rig> True.
[07-Feb-2016 21:55:27]  <IllFlower> Or munchkin. I keep forgetting which is which.
[07-Feb-2016 21:56:16]  <Rig> Same-ish thing anyway.
[07-Feb-2016 21:56:44]  <Rig> So, the stakes being to make her spill the beans about Suzuhara's family?
[07-Feb-2016 21:56:50]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[07-Feb-2016 21:57:02]  <IllFlower> Talking, of course. Let's talk.

[07-Feb-2016 21:58:17]  <Rig> Minmax indeed.
[07-Feb-2016 21:58:43]  <Rig> Is Emiko joining in?
[07-Feb-2016 21:59:01]  <Calica> I can but it looks like it won't be necessary anyways so maybe I shouldn't, lol
[07-Feb-2016 22:01:32]  <Rig> Okay, I guess Noriko can just take over.
[07-Feb-2016 22:01:45]  <IllFlower> I HAVE CONTROL
[07-Feb-2016 22:02:21]  <Rig> Let me just check on dinner real quick and then I'll raise.
[07-Feb-2016 22:06:09]  <IllFlower> Raise with a casserole.
[07-Feb-2016 22:07:12]  <Rig> Noriko steps around from behind Emiko. "Suzuhara Rei was telling us about her circumstances the other day. She seemed to think she was wronged by someone. Is that what they told you?"

[07-Feb-2016 22:41:13]  <IllFlower> Anyway, I think we can move on to the next day, yeah?
[07-Feb-2016 22:41:33]  <Rig> Yeah, that works for me.
[07-Feb-2016 22:41:33]  <Calica> yeah, I think that's a good plan
[07-Feb-2016 22:43:03]  <IllFlower> Anyone got scenes or should I go?
[07-Feb-2016 22:45:33]  <IllFlower> Eh, I guess I'll go.
[07-Feb-2016 22:45:57]  <IllFlower> I think it's, uh, Tuesday?
[07-Feb-2016 22:47:37]  <IllFlower> Anyway, Noriko's in the student council room, getting some stuff sorted out with Takumi.
[07-Feb-2016 22:47:48]  <IllFlower> It's a little awkward, given their last conversation.
[07-Feb-2016 22:48:02]  <IllFlower> Also because their relationship is kinda generally awkward.
[07-Feb-2016 22:48:32]  <Calica> ("Also because Noriko is kinda generally awkward.")
[07-Feb-2016 22:48:40]  <IllFlower> That's not very nice!
[07-Feb-2016 22:49:07]  <IllFlower> "Hey, Hisakawa, did you get the Tea Club's budget sorted out?"
[07-Feb-2016 22:50:08]  <Rig> Sorry, one moment. Gotta swap laundry
[07-Feb-2016 22:52:18]  * Rig thinks of ridiculous things to say about the tea clubs budget.
[07-Feb-2016 22:52:54]  <Rig> Noriko shakes her head, "I have no idea how they expect to buy entirely new china this year unless they're planning on reusing last year's tea leaves."
[07-Feb-2016 22:53:22]  <IllFlower> Takumi grins.
[07-Feb-2016 22:54:13]  <IllFlower> "Maybe they'll find a wealthy benefactor."
[07-Feb-2016 22:56:03]  <Rig> "That's the dream of every young club, isn't it?" Noriko looks up from the budgets in front of her. "Shinohara, can I ask you something?"
[07-Feb-2016 22:56:12]  <IllFlower> "Yeah?"
[07-Feb-2016 22:56:23]  <IllFlower> ("D-Do you like me?")
[07-Feb-2016 22:57:04]  <Rig> "The other day... you mentioned that your sister was upset with how you spent your time. Did you ever work it out with her?"
[07-Feb-2016 22:58:18]  <IllFlower> "Not really." He raps a sheaf of paper against the table to straighten it out.
[07-Feb-2016 22:59:04]  <Rig> "Oh," Noriko says quietly. "I'm sorry." 
[07-Feb-2016 22:59:24]  <IllFlower> "She's the only one who cares like that," Takumi says. "So it's not a big deal."
[07-Feb-2016 23:01:53]  <Rig> Noriko is at a loss for what to say. Does he want more people to care like that? "I'm sure other people care," she says. "Did you want to talk about it?"
[07-Feb-2016 23:02:29]  <IllFlower> I didn't mean it like that, lol.
[07-Feb-2016 23:03:09]  <Rig> Hahaha, should I do something else?
[07-Feb-2016 23:03:21]  <IllFlower> It was more like "she's the only one who gets on my case about it."
[07-Feb-2016 23:03:53]  <Rig> Okay, lemme do something else.
[07-Feb-2016 23:04:12]  <BGTB2005> 14kiss :p
[07-Feb-2016 23:04:47]  <Rig> Noriko is at a loss for what to say. Does he want more people to care like that? "Oh, well, I guess you get to continue setting your own schedule, right?"
[07-Feb-2016 23:06:43]  <IllFlower> "Eh... sort of." He glances out the door. "Actually, I have to have a little meeting with Mr. Takatsuki about the festival prep... so not really my own schedule, but..."
[07-Feb-2016 23:08:32]  <Rig> "But close enough, I guess."
[07-Feb-2016 23:09:22]  <IllFlower> "I guess. I'll be back in a little bit, all right?
[07-Feb-2016 23:09:29]  <IllFlower> "Are you still going to be here?"
[07-Feb-2016 23:09:51]  <Rig> "Yeah, I think I can manage without you for a little while. I should be. I still need to figure out this budget"
[07-Feb-2016 23:11:37]  * Calica accidentally presses F, gets into a conflict with the budget
[07-Feb-2016 23:11:54]  <IllFlower> LINE ITEM USED YENFLATION
[07-Feb-2016 23:12:32]  <IllFlower> "Great. Thanks." Takumi smiles again and heads out, closing the door behind him. It's not long before it opens again.
[07-Feb-2016 23:13:29]  <Rig> "Oh, hey, you're back early," Noriko says without looking up.
[07-Feb-2016 23:14:33]  <IllFlower> The door closes again.
[07-Feb-2016 23:14:43]  <IllFlower> "I heard you and Minase are getting friendly," an unfamiliar voice says.
[07-Feb-2016 23:15:58]  <IllFlower> Ooh, this isn't good.
[07-Feb-2016 23:16:42]  <Rig> Noriko looks up, startled, "This room is off limits if you're not in student council."
[07-Feb-2016 23:17:51]  <IllFlower> "Do I look like I care?"
[07-Feb-2016 23:18:46]  <IllFlower> This boy's hands have been behind his back the whole time, Noriko notices.
[07-Feb-2016 23:18:58]  <Rig> Anything else I should know about this boy?
[07-Feb-2016 23:19:29]  <IllFlower> Well, he's getting closer and closer...
[07-Feb-2016 23:20:04]  <Rig> Noriko stands up. "You need to leave now."
[07-Feb-2016 23:21:03]  <IllFlower> "We can't really afford to let Minase get on you folks' good side. Orders from the man himself, and, well...
[07-Feb-2016 23:21:24]  <IllFlower> "I guess you're cute. Maybe a few scars would make you cuter."
[07-Feb-2016 23:21:36]  <IllFlower> Ooh, he has a knife. This really isn't good.
[07-Feb-2016 23:21:59]  <Calica> insert joke about this being nsfw here
[07-Feb-2016 23:22:34]  <Rig> brb
[07-Feb-2016 23:22:48]  <IllFlower> lol
[07-Feb-2016 23:22:54]  <IllFlower> Impeccable timing.
[07-Feb-2016 23:22:58]  <IllFlower> COMMERCIAL BREAK
[07-Feb-2016 23:24:03]  <Rig> Okay, after that word from our sponsors, I think we might be in conflict territory.
[07-Feb-2016 23:24:08]  * Rig mashes the F key
[07-Feb-2016 23:24:28]  <Calica> i see you finally found it on your xbone controller
[07-Feb-2016 23:24:59]  <Rig> I just glued the letter F to a button.
[07-Feb-2016 23:25:11]  <Rig> I guess the stakes are escaping from this knife-wielding dude.
[07-Feb-2016 23:26:21]  <IllFlower> Something like that.
[07-Feb-2016 23:26:32]  <Rig> Any preference on the starting arena?
[07-Feb-2016 23:27:14]  <IllFlower> Well, he has a knife, so I'm gonna say hand-to-hand.
[07-Feb-2016 23:27:26]  <Rig> How about we start with physical non-fighting.
[07-Feb-2016 23:27:36]  <Rig> Unless you want to raise first?
[07-Feb-2016 23:27:37]  <BGTB2005> magic :V

[07-Feb-2016 23:30:03]  <IllFlower> The boy launches himself at Noriko, knife aimed straight at her face.

[07-Feb-2016 23:35:32]  <Rig> "Akamine put you up to this?" Noriko shouts at the boy, trying to attract someone's attention. In the meantime, she grabs a stack of student handbooks off the nearest desk and begins to fling them at her assailant.

[07-Feb-2016 23:36:55]  <IllFlower> "Oh, of course!"
[07-Feb-2016 23:37:35]  <IllFlower> The boy dodges, surprisingly deft given his awkward frame.

[07-Feb-2016 23:39:32]  <BGTB2005> I think oyu can also get dice for improvised weapons?
[07-Feb-2016 23:39:48]  <Rig> True.
[07-Feb-2016 23:40:22]  <BGTB2005> IIRC 1d4 if it's out of desperation or not the sort of thing the item was designed for

[07-Feb-2016 23:40:52]  <Rig> Noriko scrambles under the table as the boy dives at her with his knife slashing through the air.

[07-Feb-2016 23:43:01]  <IllFlower> How desperate are you?
[07-Feb-2016 23:43:08]  <BGTB2005> I think it might be dangerous?

[07-Feb-2016 23:44:32]  <IllFlower> Okay, then, d4 it is.
[07-Feb-2016 23:44:36]  <BGTB2005> maybe you could try threatening him with the wrath of the student council? :V
[07-Feb-2016 23:44:46]  <IllFlower> I thought you might try to flip the table over with him on it or underneath it.
[07-Feb-2016 23:44:58]  <Rig> Yeah, I could do that too. That'd be a d4?
[07-Feb-2016 23:45:05]  <IllFlower> Yup.
[07-Feb-2016 23:45:28]  <Rig> Noriko flips the table over onto the attacker, hoping to pin him underneath it or at least slow him down while she gets away.

[07-Feb-2016 23:47:48]  <Calica> really anything above a 1 would've worked i think?  or maybe even a 1?  i can't remember how reversing works
[07-Feb-2016 23:47:50]  <IllFlower> The boy loses his footing and spills onto the floor in a cascade of papers.
[07-Feb-2016 23:48:20]  <IllFlower> The knife clatters down at Noriko's feet.
[07-Feb-2016 23:48:42]  <IllFlower> Give.
[07-Feb-2016 23:48:59]  <Rig> Noriko kicks the knife into a corner under a table.
[07-Feb-2016 23:49:40]  <Rig> She also valiantly resists the urge to kick the prone boy in the face a few times.
[07-Feb-2016 23:50:13]  <IllFlower> How noble.
[07-Feb-2016 23:50:31]  <BGTB2005> I don't think anyone would really blame her for kicking him
[07-Feb-2016 23:50:52]  <BGTB2005> Well, Satori might, but still
[07-Feb-2016 23:51:06]  <Calica> i mean, he tried to attack her with a knife
[07-Feb-2016 23:51:25]  <Rig> Not sure if Noriko should call the police or something. Any thoughts?
[07-Feb-2016 23:52:23]  <IllFlower> Or interrogate the *fuck* out of him.
[07-Feb-2016 23:52:37]  <BGTB2005> while waiting for the police
[07-Feb-2016 23:53:01]  <Calica> ("First question: What the fuck.")
[07-Feb-2016 23:53:27]  <Rig> Noriko crouches down in front of the boy. "Akamine sent you?"
[07-Feb-2016 23:54:09]  <IllFlower> "Pretty sure I said that already," the boy says.
[07-Feb-2016 23:56:05]  <Rig> "Yeah, yeah," Noriko says. "Why? And why you? Are you that expendable or just dumb?"
[07-Feb-2016 23:56:26]  <IllFlower> Burn.
[07-Feb-2016 23:57:09]  <IllFlower> "Don't get too cocky. You pulled a nice trick, but if it weren't for that I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be in any position to talk in the first place."
[07-Feb-2016 23:59:29]  <Rig> "That doesn't answer any of my questions, so why don't you try again?"
[07-Feb-2016 23:59:43]  <IllFlower> Shit, son.
[08-Feb-2016 00:00:39]  <Rig> Should have kept the knife and tried to get a trait for enhanced interrogations.
[08-Feb-2016 00:01:00]  <Calica> noriko w. bush
[08-Feb-2016 00:01:06]  <IllFlower> Jack Noriko Bauer.
[08-Feb-2016 00:01:48]  <IllFlower> "He didn't think a little first-year girl would put up that much of a fight. Isn't that obvious?"
[08-Feb-2016 00:04:17]  <Rig> "But why did he send you? Does he really think I'm doing Minase any favors or is he just getting wound up about rumors?"
[08-Feb-2016 00:05:14]  <IllFlower> "You're *not* doing him favors?"
[08-Feb-2016 00:06:11]  <Rig> Noriko frowns. It was technically a deal with Minase, but mostly to keep him from doing anything rash.
[08-Feb-2016 00:06:32]  <Rig> "I'm helping out Mayumi and that's it."
[08-Feb-2016 00:08:03]  <IllFlower> "His girlfriend.
[08-Feb-2016 00:08:09]  <IllFlower> "So you like playing with fire."
[08-Feb-2016 00:08:50]  <Calica> no, that was Rin
[08-Feb-2016 00:09:01]  <Rig> Suzuhara Rin?
[08-Feb-2016 00:09:15]  <Calica> no, the one from the last emdogs
[08-Feb-2016 00:09:16]  <Rig> "I thought that was one of Akamine's other lackeys."
[08-Feb-2016 00:10:03]  <IllFlower> "Whatever. I'm amazed you're still involved."
[08-Feb-2016 00:11:36]  <Rig> "What do you mean?"
[08-Feb-2016 00:14:06]  <IllFlower> "Most people would back off when they saw that."
[08-Feb-2016 00:16:02]  <Rig> Noriko shrugs, "I'm not easily intimidated, as you can see."
[08-Feb-2016 00:17:46]  <Rig> Should we try a conflict to convince him to spill the beans on his boss or should we move on?
[08-Feb-2016 00:17:52]  <IllFlower> Up to you.
[08-Feb-2016 00:18:15]  <IllFlower> I don't know what you want to know about Akamine, though.
[08-Feb-2016 00:18:49]  <Calica> this has basically turned into The Noriko Session, hasn't it, heh
[08-Feb-2016 00:18:53]  <Rig> I don't know what we'd really be able to find out that we need to know. I guess finding out if he's in league with Suzuhara would be nice, but I feel like this guy probably doesn't know.
[08-Feb-2016 00:19:17]  <IllFlower> You're not far off.
[08-Feb-2016 00:19:41]  <IllFlower> What do you need to know?
[08-Feb-2016 00:19:54]  <IllFlower> I mean, outside the fact that you may have gotten on the Highland Boys' bad side.
[08-Feb-2016 00:20:00]  <Rig> If Suzuhara is calling the shots or if Akamine is, I guess.
[08-Feb-2016 00:20:34]  <IllFlower> Regarding?
[08-Feb-2016 00:21:24]  <Rig> Attacking Noriko and the general activities of the Highland Boys.
[08-Feb-2016 00:21:53]  <IllFlower> It's not much more complicated than what the boy's already said, far as Noriko.
[08-Feb-2016 00:23:14]  <Rig> Is there value in pursuing what he might know about Suzuhara?
[08-Feb-2016 00:23:27]  <IllFlower> I wouldn't say so.
[08-Feb-2016 00:24:20]  <Rig> Yeah, then I don't really know what path to pursue with him.
[08-Feb-2016 00:24:21]  <IllFlower> As far as Akamine's involved, he probably just wants you out of the picture.
[08-Feb-2016 00:25:05]  <Rig> Yeah, that makes sense.
[08-Feb-2016 00:26:26]  <Rig> Calica | BGTB2005: Any thoughts on how to proceed?
[08-Feb-2016 00:26:38]  *** CentralAve|shopping is now known as CentralAve
[08-Feb-2016 00:27:34]  <Calica> maybe ask what Suzuhara's doing but he might not know?
[08-Feb-2016 00:28:10]  <IllFlower> Maybe it's time to ask the man himself.
[08-Feb-2016 00:28:15]  <IllFlower> Or magic it out of him, who knows.
[08-Feb-2016 00:28:29]  <Rig> Yeah, maybe it is time to go after Akamine.
[08-Feb-2016 00:29:24]  <IllFlower> Would you like to make our friend send a message?
[08-Feb-2016 00:29:36]  <IllFlower> s/send/carry/
[08-Feb-2016 00:29:53]  <Rig> Yeah, that sounds good.
[08-Feb-2016 00:30:29]  <Rig> "How about you go tell Akamine I want to talk to him? No more rumors, just an honest talk."
[08-Feb-2016 00:30:40]  <Rig> I mean, Takumi will know how it is.
[08-Feb-2016 00:31:44]  <IllFlower> "Talk." The boy laughs.
[08-Feb-2016 00:31:50]  <Calica> Takumi's going to come back and the room's going to be wrecked and Noriko's meeting with another gang leader???
[08-Feb-2016 00:31:57]  <IllFlower> "Yeah, sure, I'll tell him. Might want to bring some friends."
[08-Feb-2016 00:32:24]  <Rig> "I'm sure he'll bring a few too. Hopefully ones with a bit more grace and tact than yourself."
[08-Feb-2016 00:34:30]  <IllFlower> "Yeah. Grace. That's what it'll be."
[08-Feb-2016 00:34:48]  <IllFlower> The boy pushes himself up on his feet and walks out.
[08-Feb-2016 00:37:15]  <IllFlower> Noriko looks at the clock. She probably has a few minutes to dust off before Takumi comes back.
[08-Feb-2016 00:39:06]  <Rig> Noriko tries to put the room back in order, but is unsure of what to do with the knife. It's not quite as large as it appeared to be during the skirmish, but it certainly isn't something you could carry around unnoticed.
[08-Feb-2016 00:41:20]  <Rig> She decides to stash it in the bottom of a drawer and handle it later.
[08-Feb-2016 00:41:59]  <IllFlower> She does have a school bag...
[08-Feb-2016 00:42:21]  <Rig> Right, right.
[08-Feb-2016 00:42:34]  <Rig> Scratch that and have her just tuck it somewhere in her bag.
[08-Feb-2016 00:44:16]  <IllFlower> Takumi comes back in just after Noriko finishes straightening up.
[08-Feb-2016 00:44:30]  <IllFlower> "Did something happen? You look a little frazzled."
[08-Feb-2016 00:46:44]  <Rig> "Oh, just a student came in needing something and they completely distracted me. It's all fine now. How was your meeting?"
[08-Feb-2016 00:47:49]  <IllFlower> "Same old, same old."
[08-Feb-2016 00:48:11]  <IllFlower> I don't really have anything left for this scene that's useful to the plot but I can totally do an uncomfortable crush scene.
[08-Feb-2016 00:49:48]  <Rig> Nah, it's good. I kind of need to go at 8, do you feel comfortable wrapping up here and picking up with the gang meeting.
[08-Feb-2016 00:50:23]  <Calica> i'm comfortable with that
[08-Feb-2016 00:50:25]  <IllFlower> No problem. We can pretend that Takumi invites Noriko to walk home with him and awkwardly fails to express his feelings for her.
[08-Feb-2016 00:50:36]  <IllFlower> I think plenty of stuff has happened in this session anyway.
[08-Feb-2016 00:50:39]  <BGTB2005> pfff
[08-Feb-2016 00:50:51]  <IllFlower> Oh, wait, next session is Valentine's Day, isn't it?
[08-Feb-2016 00:50:57]  * IllFlower pushes scene to next week
[08-Feb-2016 00:51:06]  <IllFlower> BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[08-Feb-2016 00:51:08]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[08-Feb-2016 00:51:13]  <Calica> pfffffffhahahahahahaha
[08-Feb-2016 00:51:14]  <BGTB2005> hahahaha
[08-Feb-2016 00:51:15]  <IllFlower> Anyway, thanks for playing. See you next time.
[08-Feb-2016 00:51:27]  <Rig> Thanks for letting me take over this session apparently.
[08-Feb-2016 00:51:37]  <Rig> And do better (sorta) at fighting than talking.
[08-Feb-2016 00:51:43]  <IllFlower> Well, you barely did anything last time, so yeah.
[08-Feb-2016 00:51:45]  <IllFlower> ;)
[08-Feb-2016 00:52:34]  <Rig> I see how it is.
[08-Feb-2016 00:52:44]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | NOVUS ORDO CONSERVATORUM: Love Edition - SUNDAY 4/1p
[08-Feb-2016 00:52:56]  <IllFlower> I bring balance to the Force.
[08-Feb-2016 00:52:58]  <Rig> Anyway, thanks. I'll see you next Sunday when we can flirt through school children.
[08-Feb-2016 00:53:02]  <IllFlower> :D
