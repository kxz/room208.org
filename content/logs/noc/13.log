@time=2016-03-19T20:05:37.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Last time, our heroes went over to the next ward to help a colleague in a spot of trouble.
@time=2016-03-19T20:05:48.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or several burning apartments' worth.
@time=2016-03-19T20:07:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anyway.
@time=2016-03-19T20:08:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Minako guides the Conservators over to a low-rise housing complex. It doesn't look like it's in the greatest of states, especially given the black scar across one building around the third floor.
@time=2016-03-19T20:09:15.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There's a substantial amount of caution tape blocking off the corridor. A couple of police officers are going over the scene.
@time=2016-03-19T20:10:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Another one is interviewing a young mother down in front of the building.
@time=2016-03-19T20:10:58.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko takes in the scene, thinking about how Suzuhara could be the one behind all this.
@time=2016-03-19T20:11:34.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The witch possessed a man," Minako says. "Tsukumo was trying to stop him on that balcony when he got hurt."
@time=2016-03-19T20:13:17.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Looking at the extent of the damage, it seems a miracle that Tsukumo got away with the relatively superficial burns he did.
@time=2016-03-19T20:13:59.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The fire started after he tried to stop him?"
@time=2016-03-19T20:15:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"No, he'd already set the fire, but Tsukumo's a water mage, so he thought... yeah."
@time=2016-03-19T20:16:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Minako frowns. "It didn't go quite the way we'd expected."
@time=2016-03-19T20:17:42.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko nods. "It looks like there was a lot of fire. I don't think Suzuhara was ever so explicit." Noriko looks to Emiko for her thoughts.
@time=2016-03-19T20:19:48.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"She wasn't, but if she's got witches following her, she may not have that much control."
@time=2016-03-19T20:21:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The police officer who was conducting an interview walks up to the girls. "Sorry, can I help you?" she asks.
@time=2016-03-19T20:23:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko smiles politely. "We were just curious about what had happened."
@time=2016-03-19T20:23:06.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The badge on her uniform reads "Sachi Inamura."
@time=2016-03-19T20:23:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"There was a fire here," Inamura says, restating the obvious. "We think it was set deliberately."
@time=2016-03-19T20:24:41.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"It looks quite bad.  Were there any injuries?"
@time=2016-03-19T20:25:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Not that we know of. We got lucky. It happened in the middle of the day, so most of the apartments' occupants weren't home."
@time=2016-03-19T20:29:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Do you know who lived there?" Noriko asks, pretty certain the officer has to be getting tired of the questions.
@time=2016-03-19T20:30:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I can't talk about that. We have a pretty good idea of who the intended target was, though."
@time=2016-03-19T20:32:29.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Emiko looks at Minako, wondering if she knows who the intended target was
@time=2016-03-19T20:33:45.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Another officer, Katsumi Higashiyama from the nameplate, walks up to Inamura and taps her on the shoulder. "We found this inside the place."
@time=2016-03-19T20:34:26.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Higashiyama holds up a charred index card with a hand-drawn map and a partially-readable series of numbers that looks like half of a date and time.
@time=2016-03-19T20:35:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That's the apartment, all right," Inamura says. "Can you put that into evidence?"
@time=2016-03-19T20:36:20.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Higashiyama nods obligingly and begins to walk back towards the crime scene.
@time=2016-03-19T20:36:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Were that date and time recent?
@time=2016-03-19T20:36:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :*the
@time=2016-03-19T20:36:50.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Can we even tell?
@time=2016-03-19T20:37:21.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :If Noriko's reading it right, it looks like earlier today.
@time=2016-03-19T20:38:23.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, maybe some kind of map to the apartment and a time to go and set the fire?
@time=2016-03-19T20:40:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Seems like it.
@time=2016-03-19T20:40:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It looks like the Conservators won't get much more information unless they inspect the room themselves, but with the police there that'll be a challenge.
@time=2016-03-19T20:41:03.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :is IllFlower suggesting we become outlaws?
@time=2016-03-19T20:41:14.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He generally does.
@time=2016-03-19T20:41:33.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Me? Never.
@time=2016-03-19T20:41:38.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Perhaps we should just excuse ourselves from the police and see if there is anything interesting nearby?
@time=2016-03-19T20:41:48.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Or maybe wait for them to leave and then search the room?
@time=2016-03-19T20:43:27.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Your call.
@time=2016-03-19T20:44:07.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Calica, BGTB2005?
@time=2016-03-19T20:44:41.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :is there any real reason we can't do both?
@time=2016-03-19T20:45:07.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, seems like we could try to see if anything interesting nearby first, then try to search the room tonight or something
@time=2016-03-19T20:45:19.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :assuming the police aren't keeping 24-hour watch
@time=2016-03-19T20:46:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Probably not. What would the purpose be of returning to the scene of this crime?
@time=2016-03-19T20:48:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Unless the arsonist wants to come back and appreciate his handiwork.
@time=2016-03-19T20:48:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Never doubt a narcissist arsonist. 
@time=2016-03-19T20:49:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Would make a good song title, "Narcissist Arsonist."
@time=2016-03-19T20:50:50.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It'd be a showstopper. It'd burn down the venue.
@time=2016-03-19T20:51:27.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So, plan is to do a lap around the housing complex and see if there is anything interesting and then head back to the crime scene?

@time=2016-03-19T20:53:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The Conservators leave Inamura to her work and head around to the other side of the block.
@time=2016-03-19T20:54:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The witch probably left traces of its presence at the scene," Minako says, "but they'll be gone soon if--"
@time=2016-03-19T20:55:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A buzzing sound interrupts the conversation. Minako reaches into her pocket for her phone, but it's still as a painting.
@time=2016-03-19T20:56:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It turns out that Satori is ascending to heaven suddenly and the buzzing noise is her.
@time=2016-03-19T20:56:45.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :her name does mean enlightenment iirc
@time=2016-03-19T20:56:53.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :pff
@time=2016-03-19T20:56:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Minako scans her surroundings. "It sounds like it's coming from underneath those bushes..."
@time=2016-03-19T20:58:26.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko moves toward the bushes cautiously, almost expecting it to be angry insects.
@time=2016-03-19T20:59:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Angry insects that make a very regular pulsating noise.

@time=2016-03-19T21:00:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Feeling around underneath the foliage, Noriko fishes out a very scuffed-looking black flip phone.
@time=2016-03-19T21:00:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Should I answer it?"
@time=2016-03-19T21:00:32.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Might as well, I think."
@time=2016-03-19T21:00:46.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko flips open the phone. "Hello?"
@time=2016-03-19T21:00:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The name on the incoming call is "Yamada."
@time=2016-03-19T21:01:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"He--" Yamada stops short. "Who is this?"
@time=2016-03-19T21:02:38.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Emiko tries to remember if she knows any Yamadas.  (Was she able to see this?)
@time=2016-03-19T21:02:56.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let's assume Noriko said who it was.
@time=2016-03-19T21:03:12.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Probably. But there are a million Yamadas in this city alone.
@time=2016-03-19T21:03:40.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :probably at least a dozen at school
@time=2016-03-19T21:03:49.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I, uh, found this phone. Do you know who it belongs to?" Noriko asks.
@time=2016-03-19T21:05:41.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yamada clears his throat. "Yes. Can you turn it in at a police box? I'll tell its owner where to retrieve it."
@time=2016-03-19T21:07:51.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko covers the mouthpiece and relays the call to the group.
@time=2016-03-19T21:08:20.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Should we?"
@time=2016-03-19T21:09:11.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Probably, but on the other hand, this close to the scene of the crime..."
@time=2016-03-19T21:10:22.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"What should I say? Should I ask him about the owner?"
@time=2016-03-19T21:10:55.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Worth a shot."
@time=2016-03-19T21:13:04.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Do you know where the owner is? It looks like the police are searching for him." Noriko says, trying to be imperative on the phone.
@time=2016-03-19T21:13:42.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"I can't talk about that," Yamada says, unintentially echoing the exact phrasing of Officer Inamura just moments ago.
@time=2016-03-19T21:15:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko shakes her head. "I'll drop the phone at a police box then."
@time=2016-03-19T21:16:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Thanks." Then a click as Yamada hangs up.
@time=2016-03-19T21:18:06.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"That wasn't at all helpful," Noriko says. She looks down at the flip phone and starts trying to find pictures or anything identifying.
@time=2016-03-19T21:19:39.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The information on the phone is completely barebones. There are only two numbers in the contacts, Yamada and someone named "Lerna." A foreign woman? Weird.
@time=2016-03-19T21:20:38.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :There are a few blurry shots of people, all invariably young, male, and seen from a distance.
@time=2016-03-19T21:20:47.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :call Lerna?  no way that could possibly go wrong
@time=2016-03-19T21:20:50.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, it's not exactly a cutting-edge camera.
@time=2016-03-19T21:21:10.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"There isn't anything useful on this. Seems like a burner phone."

@time=2016-03-19T21:21:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :boooo get off the stage
@time=2016-03-19T21:22:30.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Maybe we could call this other person? Lerna?" Noriko says. She holds the phone out to Emiko.
@time=2016-03-19T21:22:58.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Might be worth a shot.  Especially if it's a burner, who knows who they'll actually send to pick it up"
@time=2016-03-19T21:24:05.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :are you suggesting Emiko make the call?
@time=2016-03-19T21:24:10.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She is the charm offensive.
@time=2016-03-19T21:24:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Minako looks skeptically at Noriko. "I don't know if calling random people on a suspicious phone is a great idea..."
@time=2016-03-19T21:24:35.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"How do you feel about sneaking into a crime scene then?"
@time=2016-03-19T21:25:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Minako sighs. "Okay, okay, I guess you have a point."
@time=2016-03-19T21:26:33.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Emiko picks up the phone from Noriko and presses the buttons to make a call.
@time=2016-03-19T21:29:11.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :After several rings, a woman picks up the phone. "What's the story?"
@time=2016-03-19T21:29:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :First time Emiko's ever heard that greeting, certainly.
@time=2016-03-19T21:29:33.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :gratuitous english, I assume :p

@time=2016-03-19T21:32:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Sanada's alive?" a male voice in the background says before the call goes dead.
@time=2016-03-19T21:32:24.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It lasted approximately ten seconds.
