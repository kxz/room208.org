@time=2016-04-16T20:52:28.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You could tell Minako, for starters...
@time=2016-04-16T20:52:54.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :About the drug ring stuff?  Probably a good idea
@time=2016-04-16T20:54:11.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah, probably
@time=2016-04-16T20:54:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I suggest meeting in Noriko's hospital room.

@time=2016-04-16T20:55:24.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :yeah that sounds like a good idea.  We've had a lot of scenes in hospital rooms, haven't we?
@time=2016-04-16T20:55:54.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :it isn't an EmDog arc until we've had a scene in a hospital room

@time=2016-04-16T21:02:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :The conversation eventually gets down to business.
@time=2016-04-16T21:02:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"There's one thing that doesn't add up, though," Minako says.
@time=2016-04-16T21:02:26.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And what's that?"
@time=2016-04-16T21:02:40.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"The police officer. Higashiyama. Why did she lie in wait just for us?"
@time=2016-04-16T21:04:08.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Why would she call us out about magic in the open?"
@time=2016-04-16T21:05:07.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Minako shakes her head. "It's not that. She knows something. She *expects* something. I can't quite put my finger on it, but..."
@time=2016-04-16T21:06:25.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Maybe she wasn't waiting for us?"
@time=2016-04-16T21:06:51.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Do you think she was expecting the culprits to do magic?"
@time=2016-04-16T21:07:31.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: "If she wasn't, the fact that she knew of magic was a hell of a coincidence."
@time=2016-04-16T21:12:32.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Noriko sighs, wincing a little. "You think she was ambushing us because she was involved in the original attack?"

@time=2016-04-16T21:16:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A pause. "I just think there's something weird about all of this."
@time=2016-04-16T21:19:31.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Definitely.  Have there been any more incidents since we were last here?"
@time=2016-04-16T21:19:31.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Maybe we should look into that organization Higashiyama mentioned?"
@time=2016-04-16T21:20:18.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm thinking that organisation she mentioned was the police force?
@time=2016-04-16T21:20:55.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I assumed it was something more tightly associated with magic.
@time=2016-04-16T21:21:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :It was supposed to be the police. Probably.
@time=2016-04-16T21:22:01.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :maybe worth digging into
@time=2016-04-16T21:22:37.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :she mentioned her cousin, maybe that's worth looking into?  probably not though, since that was a throwaway reference to the last emdogs

@time=2016-04-16T23:05:54.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :If there were an applicable trait, this question would be easy to answer, but you have a Conservator relationship instead of a trait.
@time=2016-04-16T23:05:59.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :the lack of end quote is deliberate, but I'm not sure if I should let Inamura have a word in before going to the next half (which would be about how the letterbomb caused no actual injury)

@time=2016-04-16T23:11:51.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Should I just say the bit about the letterbomb?
@time=2016-04-16T23:12:09.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :sure
@time=2016-04-16T23:14:22.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I thought Noriko was undergoing rigorous PT in order to become Super Magical Girl Level 3.

@time=2016-04-16T23:19:58.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In a classroom? Bold.
@time=2016-04-16T23:20:37.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :it's why I said small
@time=2016-04-16T23:20:41.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :like, smaller than a desk or something
@time=2016-04-16T23:23:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Satori hovers a hand over Inamura's desk. A small, semi-transparent square appears underneath her palm, standing straight up from finger to wrist.
@time=2016-04-16T23:24:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Inamura taps a finger against the barrier. "What's that?"

@time=2016-04-16T23:30:05.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"You think she's hiding something."
@time=2016-04-16T23:30:30.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Emiko nods.
@time=2016-04-16T23:31:53.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"And that's why you want to do this under the radar."
@time=2016-04-16T23:35:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Inamura ponders for a bit. "All right. I don't know what you two are digging around in, and to be honest I don't want to. I'll get you the number of the informant's phone, but after that I'm out of this."
@time=2016-04-16T23:35:13.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Fair enough.  Thanks for your help!"
@time=2016-04-16T23:35:25.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You sound like someone getting off the line with customer service.
@time=2016-04-16T23:36:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just like "Now that you know magic exists, thanks for being a good sport."
@time=2016-04-16T23:38:35.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :thanks for not revealing magic to the world and thus making the Order put a bag over your head and take you to an undisclosed location
@time=2016-04-16T23:39:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And scene.

@time=2016-04-16T23:41:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That evening, Emiko's phone gets a text. The only contents are a 10-digit string of numbers: 090...
@time=2016-04-16T23:41:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :This must be the informant's number.
@time=2016-04-16T23:43:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So now what? Does she just call? That seems a little too straightforward.
@time=2016-04-16T23:46:25.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :what else can she do with it?  Speakerphone at Noriko's hospital room?
@time=2016-04-16T23:46:33.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha.
@time=2016-04-16T23:46:46.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :...yeah?

@time=2016-04-16T23:47:59.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Well, we can leave off now and make this a cliffhanger.
@time=2016-04-16T23:48:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :In time-honored contrived cliffhanger style.
@time=2016-04-16T23:48:14.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And hopefully we can rope Noriko back into things.
@time=2016-04-16T23:48:19.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Maybe next time Noriko can actually do something.
