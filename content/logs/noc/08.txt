[30-Jan-2016 21:26:50]  <Calica> So I think we had finished off last time with the convenience store guy talking about short selling
[30-Jan-2016 21:27:29]  <IllFlower> Yeah, let me pull out my finance dictionary first.
[30-Jan-2016 21:28:20]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | RIGHT NOW: Novus Ordo Conservatorum
[30-Jan-2016 21:28:32]  <IllFlower> Anyway, how did we want to pick up from here?
[30-Jan-2016 21:30:30]  <Rig> Well, we have a better idea of why Suzuhara might hate Tamura.
[30-Jan-2016 21:30:36]  <Rig> Still a little unclear though.
[30-Jan-2016 21:32:50]  <IllFlower> Isn't everything?
[30-Jan-2016 21:33:12]  <Calica> yeah.  For instance, what is Suzuhara doing
[30-Jan-2016 21:33:40]  <IllFlower> Magic, obviously!
[30-Jan-2016 21:34:28]  <IllFlower> Well, if no one has anything they want to do, I can pick up.
[30-Jan-2016 21:35:38]  <IllFlower> Bueller?
[30-Jan-2016 21:35:53]  <Calica> i can't think of anything in particular I want to do
[30-Jan-2016 21:35:58]  <Rig> Yeah, I don't know if I have anything for Noriko to say.
[30-Jan-2016 21:36:26]  <IllFlower> We'll skip out of the last scene and pick up on Monday, at school.
[30-Jan-2016 21:37:21]  <IllFlower> Noriko arrives early, just in time to catch Takumi at the gates.
[30-Jan-2016 21:38:03]  <IllFlower> "Hey, Hisakawa. How's it going?" he asks.
[30-Jan-2016 21:40:14]  <IllFlower> He looks unusually nervous this morning. Noriko remembers him as being more of the easygoing type.
[30-Jan-2016 21:40:57]  <IllFlower> (Other characters may feel free to barge in as [in]sensitively as they wish.)
[30-Jan-2016 21:41:07]  <Rig> "Hey," she says. The weekend didn't really ease her mind. "I'm okay. How about you?" She tries to put on a sincere smile, but it feels more uncertain than honest.
[30-Jan-2016 21:43:26]  <IllFlower> "My sister came home to visit. She's as demanding as ever. Says I need to spend more time studying," Takumi says.
[30-Jan-2016 21:43:33]  <IllFlower> He's clearly feeling Noriko out about a sensitive subject. This is awkward.
[30-Jan-2016 21:44:30]  <Calica> "Is this a usual thing when your sister is over?"
[30-Jan-2016 21:44:52]  <IllFlower> Suddenly, Emiko appears and inserts herself into the conversation.
[30-Jan-2016 21:45:09]  <IllFlower> "SURPRIIIIIIIIIIISE"
[30-Jan-2016 21:45:35]  <Calica> pfff
[30-Jan-2016 21:46:02]  <Rig> Noriko's question for Takumi is lost under Emiko's bubbly interruption. 
[30-Jan-2016 21:46:23]  <IllFlower> "Huh? Oh." Takumi laughs nervously.
[30-Jan-2016 21:47:03]  <IllFlower> "Well, uh, she broke her back to get into Tokyo U, so I think she's a little annoyed at me for not putting in the same amount of effort..."
[30-Jan-2016 21:47:53]  <Rig> "It always seems to me like you're busy. Between track and the student council it's amazing you have any time to study."
[30-Jan-2016 21:48:23]  <IllFlower> "Yeah, that's exactly what pisses her off, see..."
[30-Jan-2016 21:48:51]  <IllFlower> Emiko hears Mayumi calling to her from not too far away. "Good morning!"
[30-Jan-2016 21:48:57]  <Calica> how are extracurriculars and the like seen in the japanese school system
[30-Jan-2016 21:49:09]  <Calica> "Good morning, Mayumi!  How are you feeling now?"
[30-Jan-2016 21:49:36]  <Rig> "Does she want you to quit the track team?" Noriko asks, ignoring their growing crowd of companions for the moment.
[30-Jan-2016 21:49:46]  <IllFlower> Calica: "A lot better!" Mayumi says. "Hope I didn't make you worry."
[30-Jan-2016 21:50:25]  <IllFlower> Rig: "She wants me to do a lot of things. It's hard to keep track.
[30-Jan-2016 21:50:31]  <IllFlower> "It's like she's trying to become our mom."
[30-Jan-2016 21:50:49]  <IllFlower> Takumi looks aside for a moment at Emiko.
[30-Jan-2016 21:51:34]  <IllFlower> He makes a small motion with his shoulder to indicate that Emiko's timing was insanely bad and that he wanted to talk in private. Oh, dear.
[30-Jan-2016 21:51:51]  <Rig> And now we're on the bad ending path.
[30-Jan-2016 21:51:59]  <Calica> "Oh, I'm sorry.  I can step aside, if you'd like."
[30-Jan-2016 21:52:12]  <IllFlower> Emiko wasn't supposed to notice, lol.
[30-Jan-2016 21:52:20]  <IllFlower> Too busy having a good time with Mayumi.
[30-Jan-2016 21:52:33]  <Calica> oh, lol, I can say something to Mayumi instead
[30-Jan-2016 21:52:59]  <Calica> (if I seem a little out of it at least part of it is that I've got my roommate's kids arguing with each other quite loudly outside the door)
[30-Jan-2016 21:53:06]  <Icon> :<
[30-Jan-2016 21:53:39]  <Rig> Noriko gives an apologetic smile and considers asking if Takumi wants to talk later.
[30-Jan-2016 21:54:05]  <Calica> Emiko steps aside to talk to Mayumi.  "It's okay.  You're not the one who planted the letter there."
[30-Jan-2016 21:54:19]  <IllFlower> Calica: Try yelling "YOU'RE BOTH POOPYHEADS SO SHUT UP"
[30-Jan-2016 21:55:06]  <Icon> (For a second I thought you meant in-game. :V)
[30-Jan-2016 21:56:02]  <IllFlower> Rig: Takumi leans in, and says quietly, "I don't know how to say this, but did you talk to Hiroshi Minase last week, by any chance?"
[30-Jan-2016 21:57:15]  <IllFlower> Calica: "What letter? I don't know what you're talking about," Mayumi says playfully. "Oh, get this, I saw the most adorable animal at the zoo yesterday..."
[30-Jan-2016 21:57:27]  <Rig> Noriko tries not to notice how tall Takumi is when he leans in to talk to her. "I... Emiko and I did," she stumbles over the words.
[30-Jan-2016 21:58:27]  <IllFlower> "What did you talk about?" Takumi asks.
[30-Jan-2016 21:59:01]  <Calica> Emiko pauses for a second, and lets Mayumi talk about her zoo experiences for a while; if she's blocking things out, it's probably not a good idea to push too hard right away.
[30-Jan-2016 21:59:10]  <IllFlower> Satori has arrived in the meantime, but is trying her best to blend in with the shoe lockers. She decided she wanted to be a chameleon over the weekend.
[30-Jan-2016 22:00:21]  <IllFlower> Calica: Emiko doesn't let on that she's also listening in on Noriko's conversation.
[30-Jan-2016 22:00:34]  <Rig> "Minase was concerned about Mayumi. He thought someone was targeting her to get to him." Noriko is confused by Takumi's sudden interest in Minase.
[30-Jan-2016 22:00:53]  <IllFlower> "Mayumi?"
[30-Jan-2016 22:02:06]  <Rig> Noriko glances in Emiko and Mayumi's direction. "His girlfriend," she says quietly.
[30-Jan-2016 22:03:24]  <IllFlower> "Ah. Emiko's friend's boyfriend, then," Takumi says, a bit slowly as he tries not to stumble over the indirectness of the relationship.
[30-Jan-2016 22:04:20]  <IllFlower> "There are some rumors going around about that. Not good ones. Like the student council is trying to negotiate for something from the gangs."
[30-Jan-2016 22:05:12]  <IllFlower> Mayumi is still talking about the animal, which she has yet to name or adequately describe in terms other than synonyms for "cute."
[30-Jan-2016 22:05:27]  <Rig> Noriko sighs, "All because I talked to Minase?"
[30-Jan-2016 22:06:04]  <IllFlower> "People notice these things. You're not exactly anonymous, and that goes double for Minase."
[30-Jan-2016 22:06:07]  <Rig> She may have made a shady deal with Minase, but it was hardly like she'd made it in the name of the student council.
[30-Jan-2016 22:07:23]  <Rig> "Rumors are just rumors. Either way, I'll keep away from Minase and his friends, if it'll help you out."
[30-Jan-2016 22:08:46]  <IllFlower> "Sorry, it's not really my place to tell you who you can or can't talk to. Just... it might be good if you're a little more discreet."
[30-Jan-2016 22:10:53]  <IllFlower> ("WHY DID I GO INTO POLITICS FUCK EVERYTHING")
[30-Jan-2016 22:11:59]  <Rig> Noriko shrugs awkwardly. "I didn't realize how aggressive the rumor mill could be. I'll be more careful. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?" Noriko is a little put off that Takumi seemed to only want to talk to her in order to tell her off.
[30-Jan-2016 22:12:39]  *** Medicine <~Vick@d67-193-23-119.home3.cgocable.net> has joined #madokamadness
[30-Jan-2016 22:13:01]  <IllFlower> "Um..." Takumi looks away. "N-No, not really.
[30-Jan-2016 22:13:25]  <IllFlower> "I'll see you at the council meeting."
[30-Jan-2016 22:13:46]  <IllFlower> He turns, waves to Mayumi for some odd reason (not that she's unhappy with that), and leaves.
[30-Jan-2016 22:15:23]  <IllFlower> (Noriko bites her lip, and then punches a hole in the nearest wall.)
[30-Jan-2016 22:15:47]  <Rig> Noriko watches Takumi head off and wonders what this whole conversation was about. It seems like everyone she's talked to for the last week has had some hidden agenda. Maybe she should have stayed out of the student council.
[30-Jan-2016 22:16:11]  <Rig> "Hi, Mayumi," she says, turning to greet her friend's friend.
[30-Jan-2016 22:16:11]  <Calica> as IF said, politics
[30-Jan-2016 22:16:25]  <Rig> "You enjoyed the zoo then?"
[30-Jan-2016 22:16:54]  <IllFlower> Her response very clearly indicates that she did.
[30-Jan-2016 22:17:45]  <Rig> Noriko does her best to not wince at the excited noises Mayumi makes about the animals she saw.
[30-Jan-2016 22:17:58]  <Calica> just the one animal
[30-Jan-2016 22:18:00]  <IllFlower> I have nothing else to say in this scene.
[30-Jan-2016 22:18:15]  <IllFlower> Noriko: hates fun 1d10
[30-Jan-2016 22:18:23]  <Calica> "Are you sure you're okay about everything that happened last week, Mayumi?"
[30-Jan-2016 22:19:01]  <Rig> Gonna take traits in jaded at 1d10
[30-Jan-2016 22:19:02]  <IllFlower> "Trust me, I'm *fine*," Mayumi says, smiling.
[30-Jan-2016 22:21:34]  <Rig> "We should probably get to class," Noriko says.
[30-Jan-2016 22:22:03]  <IllFlower> So they do.
[30-Jan-2016 22:22:48]  <Rig> Where should we timehop to next?
[30-Jan-2016 22:23:06]  <BGTB2005> lunch?
[30-Jan-2016 22:23:12]  <Rig> Skip ahead to Mayumi's desk bursting into flames during first period?
[30-Jan-2016 22:23:21]  <IllFlower> The girls hear, through the grapevine, that Suzuhara is absent today. This is apparently remarkable in and of itself, since she has a reputation for being an excellent student.
[30-Jan-2016 22:23:24]  <Rig> When it turns out that Mayumi is working with Suzuhara.
[30-Jan-2016 22:23:49]  <Rig> This school has an impressive rumor mill.
[30-Jan-2016 22:24:00]  <Calica> Emiko knows a lot of people
[30-Jan-2016 22:24:07]  <IllFlower> It's high school, dude.
[30-Jan-2016 22:25:04]  <IllFlower> Noriko is on edge for most of the day, but nothing too far out of the ordinary happens. She does pass Minase in the hallway after lunch, but he seems to totally ignore her presence.
[30-Jan-2016 22:26:46]  <Calica> nothing out of the ordinary except Suzuhara's gone
[30-Jan-2016 22:26:56]  <IllFlower> * nothing else, fine
[30-Jan-2016 22:27:27]  <IllFlower> Now we'll just whiplash everyone by jumping to Satori's point of view.
[30-Jan-2016 22:27:34]  <Rig> So, magic girl with revenge motives missing.
[30-Jan-2016 22:27:55]  <Rig> Satori is watching a cricket.
[30-Jan-2016 22:27:58]  <Calica> and nobody seems to actually remember anything except our deal with Suzuhara
[30-Jan-2016 22:28:40]  <IllFlower> It's after dinner, and the Nakajima family is just kind of generally lounging around in the living room, as families are wont to do after dinner.
[30-Jan-2016 22:29:16]  <IllFlower> Chie and Satori are watching television when the phone rings.
[30-Jan-2016 22:29:50]  <IllFlower> "That's mine," Chie says, and runs off to answer it.
[30-Jan-2016 22:31:30]  *** Rig <~Iverum@2602:306:37ff:ad40:4d19:a992:8fac:61e1> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[30-Jan-2016 22:31:48]  *** Rig <~Iverum@99-127-250-212.lightspeed.iplsin.sbcglobal.net> has joined #madokamadness
[30-Jan-2016 22:31:48]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Rig
[30-Jan-2016 22:32:24]  <Rig> Chie kicked me off by answering the phone
[30-Jan-2016 22:32:55]  <IllFlower> "Suzuhara?" Satori hears from back in the living room. "Where *were* you today? ... no, I didn't mean that literally..."
[30-Jan-2016 22:34:00]  <IllFlower> Satori mutes the television.
[30-Jan-2016 22:35:39]  <IllFlower> "I mean, you haven't been in class since last Tuesday..." Chie continues. "No, I'm just kinda curious how you're supposed to spend all that time... A movie theater? And they didn't send you away? That's kinda nice..."
[30-Jan-2016 22:36:49]  <Rig> Suzuhara is a film buff?
[30-Jan-2016 22:37:49]  <Calica> or her sister, maybe
[30-Jan-2016 22:38:31]  <IllFlower> "You want to have dinner? Well, uh, I mean... I already ate, but... All right, we can meet up. The place by the station, yeah? ... All right, see you in a bit."
[30-Jan-2016 22:39:08]  <IllFlower> Chie walks back into the living room.
[30-Jan-2016 22:39:19]  <IllFlower> "Isn't it a bit quiet?
[30-Jan-2016 22:39:35]  <IllFlower> "Wait, 1,1onee-chan, why isn't there any sound coming from the TV?"
[30-Jan-2016 22:39:46]  <BGTB2005> Satori focuses intently on the cat in her lap, trying to pretend she didn't overhear the conversation
[30-Jan-2016 22:40:26]  <IllFlower> "Well, whatever. I'm gonna head out for a bit, okay, Satori?"
[30-Jan-2016 22:40:41]  <BGTB2005> "Okay."
[30-Jan-2016 22:40:52]  <IllFlower> Way to be passive!
[30-Jan-2016 22:40:59]  <Rig> It's her religion.
[30-Jan-2016 22:41:08]  <IllFlower> Passivity?
[30-Jan-2016 22:42:18]  <IllFlower> Sounds like a pretty easy religion.
[30-Jan-2016 22:43:21]  <Rig> Well, she also has a cat, which makes it a challenge.
[30-Jan-2016 22:43:34]  <IllFlower> Catsivity?
[30-Jan-2016 22:43:55]  <Calica> being passive even when the cat is digging her claws in, that is the true dharma
[30-Jan-2016 22:45:45]  <Calica> the question is, is Satori going to stalk her sister?
[30-Jan-2016 22:46:03]  <Nitya> 14,14fandom says yes
[30-Jan-2016 22:47:04]  <BGTB2005> Well Chie is meeting Suzuhara (probably not Rei, but still)
[30-Jan-2016 22:47:06]  <BGTB2005> so yes
[30-Jan-2016 22:49:21]  <IllFlower> After waiting a few minutes, Satori gets up and excuses herself, pretending that she's going to bed. She instead climbs out her window and follows Chie to the place by the station, not that such clandestine techniques were really necessary in the first place.
[30-Jan-2016 22:51:05]  <IllFlower> It's a small family restaurant, the kind that's already full of students at this particular hour anyway. Chie is talking to someone who looks to be her age. So not our Suzuhara, Satori confirms.
[30-Jan-2016 22:54:40]  <IllFlower> Probably her younger sister. She doesn't seem to have any of the elder Suzuhara's cold imperiousness. In fact, she seems pretty carefree. Or maybe irresponsible would be a better way of putting it.
[30-Jan-2016 22:57:14]  <IllFlower> Chie is sitting back, sipping on a soda, while Suzuhara is gesturing animatedly. Must be telling a story.
[30-Jan-2016 22:59:47]  <IllFlower> Something about Suzuhara's upper arm catches Satori's eye. It seems a bit misshapen somehow, like a bite's been taken out of it. Soon she realizes that the dark spot she's seeing isn't a shadow, but something on her skin. A bruise?
[30-Jan-2016 23:00:32]  <IllFlower> It looks distressingly fresh.
[30-Jan-2016 23:02:07]  <Calica> getting beaten up by either her big sister or the convenience store guy?
[30-Jan-2016 23:02:10]  <IllFlower> Should I monologue? It looks like I'm gonna have to monologue.
[30-Jan-2016 23:02:20]  <IllFlower> Oh, never mind.
[30-Jan-2016 23:02:24]  <BGTB2005> Pulling out her phone, Satori tries to move closer to get a better look and a picture while remaining hidden
[30-Jan-2016 23:03:25]  <IllFlower> Satori cringes at the shutter sound, but fortunately a group of girls near her is busy taking selfies on their phones and no one notices.
[30-Jan-2016 23:05:28]  <IllFlower> Are you going to do anything with that photo?
[30-Jan-2016 23:06:52]  <BGTB2005> Satori sends the photo to Emiko and Noriko
[30-Jan-2016 23:08:07]  <IllFlower> along with a note explaining its significance, obviously.
[30-Jan-2016 23:08:19]  <BGTB2005> yeah
[30-Jan-2016 23:09:08]  <IllFlower> To prevent the other two from just thinking that Satori has a weird fascination with younger girls, 1,1which is not out of the realm of plausibility in those two's minds.
[30-Jan-2016 23:09:35]  <Calica> didn't expect emdogs to go there
[30-Jan-2016 23:10:29]  <IllFlower> Where?
[30-Jan-2016 23:10:45]  <Calica> Satori having a weird fascination with younger girls
[30-Jan-2016 23:11:01]  <Rig> Noriko looks up from her homework to check her phone.
[30-Jan-2016 23:11:14]  <IllFlower> People just think she's weird. Her colleagues included.
[30-Jan-2016 23:13:54]  <IllFlower> Noriko spends a hell of a long time looking at her phone.
[30-Jan-2016 23:14:03]  <Rig> It's a very dark picture.
[30-Jan-2016 23:14:16]  <IllFlower> Har har?
[30-Jan-2016 23:14:41]  <Rig> Also, not really sure what she'd do.
[30-Jan-2016 23:14:58]  <Rig> Like, not much she can do beyond send back something like "Yep, seems suspicious to me."
[30-Jan-2016 23:15:03]  <Calica> Emiko sends a response.  "Do you think it's connected to Rei Suzuhara?"
[30-Jan-2016 23:17:55]  <IllFlower> Whatever happened to jumping to hasty conclusions?
[30-Jan-2016 23:19:27]  <Calica> Are you saying Emiko should be headed to the restaurant now?
[30-Jan-2016 23:19:33]  <BGTB2005> Satori messages back "Maybe? It's her little sister."
[30-Jan-2016 23:20:10]  <Calica> I assumed that fact was in the message attached to the picture, haha
[30-Jan-2016 23:20:12]  <IllFlower> Probably. It could be someone with the same name.
[30-Jan-2016 23:20:52]  <IllFlower> Just kidding.
[30-Jan-2016 23:24:42]  <Calica> strongly considering having Emiko decide to head over there and catch the younger Suzuhara on the way out "coincidentally"
[30-Jan-2016 23:26:33]  <IllFlower> Meanwhile, Noriko is all, "fuck, why can't things be simple?"
[30-Jan-2016 23:31:09]  <Calica> you know what?  yeah, I like this idea, let's have Emiko try to get info out when the girls leave the restaurant
[30-Jan-2016 23:33:23]  <IllFlower> Emiko texts Satori back to stall the girls if she seems them leaving.
[30-Jan-2016 23:34:00]  <IllFlower> Satori wonders how exactly she's supposed to accomplish that without blowing her cover, but Emiko arrives soon enough to make this a moot question.
[30-Jan-2016 23:34:57]  <IllFlower> What's the plan?
[30-Jan-2016 23:35:13]  <IllFlower> ("fuck plans, get money")
[30-Jan-2016 23:35:39]  <Calica> to tell Rei's sister that she looks familiar and ask if she knows her, I think
[30-Jan-2016 23:36:30]  <IllFlower> I mean, are we trying to ferret something out here?
[30-Jan-2016 23:36:44]  <Calica> to see if I can get her to drop anything on the bruise
[30-Jan-2016 23:37:41]  <IllFlower> Gotta get her to trust you and not think you're a creep.
[30-Jan-2016 23:37:49]  <IllFlower> Conflict?
[30-Jan-2016 23:38:03]  <Calica> sounds good to me
[30-Jan-2016 23:39:08]  <IllFlower> Chie and Suzuhara get up to leave, still engaged in conversation.
[30-Jan-2016 23:39:33]  <IllFlower> Emiko gestures to Satori to lay low while she walks up to the pair.
[30-Jan-2016 23:39:39]  <Calica> will Satori be involved in this as well or no
[30-Jan-2016 23:39:42]  <IllFlower> She doesn't want Chie to get suspicious.
[30-Jan-2016 23:39:48]  <IllFlower> Well, ultimately, it's up to Satori...
[30-Jan-2016 23:41:09]  <BGTB2005> On the one hand, yeah she doesn't want Chie to suspect anything
[30-Jan-2016 23:41:22]  *** Juan <~Juan_Carl@CPEbc4dfb91a083-CMbc4dfb91a080.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com> has joined #madokamadness
[30-Jan-2016 23:41:26]  <BGTB2005> on the other, she wants to know about Suzuhara's injury
[30-Jan-2016 23:43:25]  <BGTB2005> I guess Satori will stay on hand if a pursuit followup becomes necessary, but otherwise be uninvolved
[30-Jan-2016 23:44:54]  <Calica> ("Suzuhara's sister thinks Emiko's a creep. You need to chase her down and convince her otherwise.")
[30-Jan-2016 23:45:10]  <BGTB2005> lol
[30-Jan-2016 23:50:28]  <Calica> but from that it sounds like it's just me.  Talking conflict, of course
[30-Jan-2016 23:52:02]  <BGTB2005> Satori will still be there if you can figure out how to use those dice

[30-Jan-2016 23:56:28]  <IllFlower> Let me roll up.
[30-Jan-2016 23:58:46]  <IllFlower> What are the stakes?
[30-Jan-2016 23:59:05]  <IllFlower> Get her comfortable talking around Emiko?
[31-Jan-2016 00:00:28]  <Calica> That makes sense, yeah

[31-Jan-2016 00:01:17]  <IllFlower> Your raise.
[31-Jan-2016 00:01:28]  <Calica> ouch
[31-Jan-2016 00:01:58]  <IllFlower> Must be a genetic trait, good dice rolls.
[31-Jan-2016 00:04:01]  <Calica> Emiko walks by Chie and Suzuhara, trying her best to make it look accidental, and fakes a flash of surprise recognition.
[31-Jan-2016 00:04:13]  <Calica> ((I'm going to assume that Emiko and Chie have meet at least in passing at least once)
[31-Jan-2016 00:04:14]  <Calica> )
[31-Jan-2016 00:04:34]  <BGTB2005> Satori may have mentioned her once or twice
[31-Jan-2016 00:04:37]  <IllFlower> Or you could totally play it off.
[31-Jan-2016 00:04:41]  <Calica> "Hello Chie, it's been so long!  And you look familiar too, are you by any chance related to Rei Suzuhara?"
[31-Jan-2016 00:05:09]  <IllFlower> Subtle. As. Fuck.
[31-Jan-2016 00:05:17]  <BGTB2005> lol
[31-Jan-2016 00:05:27]  <Calica> subtlety just ends up slowing us down ;)

[31-Jan-2016 00:08:08]  <IllFlower> Chie makes a bit of a funny face.
[31-Jan-2016 00:08:52]  <IllFlower> The younger Suzuhara smiles. "Ruri," she says. "And you are?"

[31-Jan-2016 00:13:15]  <Calica> in the immortal words of horse_ebooks, "It was completely useless.  Thanks"
[31-Jan-2016 00:14:52]  <Calica> I think it's basically hopeless; might should just fold here and take a 4 for a followup?
[31-Jan-2016 00:15:25]  <IllFlower> Do you have any idea what you'd do for a follow-up?
[31-Jan-2016 00:17:01]  <Calica> not really.  Maybe do the stalker thing again with Satori, hide and see where she goes, but eh
[31-Jan-2016 00:18:27]  <IllFlower> Ruri laughs. "You can say it. She can be a real pain in the neck."
[31-Jan-2016 00:22:29]  <IllFlower> Chie seems to relax her guard a bit, though she's still not overjoyed about running into one of her sister's friends here.
[31-Jan-2016 00:22:41]  <Calica> "I don't know if I'd be quite that negative, but then again, I haven't had to interact with her near as much as you have, I imagine."
[31-Jan-2016 00:24:55]  <IllFlower> "I don't hate her, don't worry. Just saying, you don't have to be nice. We can both take it."
[31-Jan-2016 00:28:41]  <Calica> "She seems to be planning something, and I worry she's going after my friends."
[31-Jan-2016 00:30:04]  <IllFlower> Ruri raises an eyebrow. She glances over at Chie, who glances back at her.
[31-Jan-2016 00:30:50]  <IllFlower> "You're friends with everyone, though," Chie says.
[31-Jan-2016 00:32:37]  <IllFlower> Ruri is less snarky. "What exactly do you think she's planning?"
[31-Jan-2016 00:34:14]  <Calica> "Not entirely sure, but it has something to do with the gangs at school."
[31-Jan-2016 00:35:30]  <IllFlower> Ruri's facial expression doesn't change. It's as if she's waiting for more.
[31-Jan-2016 00:37:11]  <IllFlower> When it becomes clear that more isn't forthcoming, she says, "I know that."
[31-Jan-2016 00:37:26]  <Calica> "I think she's doing something to make it seem like something really bad's happening."
[31-Jan-2016 00:37:30]  <IllFlower> Chie is now just baffled.
[31-Jan-2016 00:37:49]  <Calica> i really don't like the phrasing of the sentence I was working on when you said that but *shrug*
[31-Jan-2016 00:38:01]  <IllFlower> I don't know what it's supposed to mean. >_>
[31-Jan-2016 00:38:28]  <IllFlower> Meanwhile, Noriko wonders what the hell the integral of hcos(x/2)dx is.
[31-Jan-2016 00:38:28]  <Calica> trying to hint at the illusions thing without going full on magical girl talk
[31-Jan-2016 00:39:05]  <Rig> Heh
[31-Jan-2016 00:41:58]  <IllFlower> "What do you mean, 'make it seem like'?"
[31-Jan-2016 00:42:42]  <Calica> "Like a stage magician or something.  Have you seen weird stuff happening around her recently?  Like, really weird?"
[31-Jan-2016 00:43:20]  <IllFlower> Ruri falls silent. She looks away, not even towards Chie.
[31-Jan-2016 00:46:02]  <IllFlower> "Sorry, I don't think I can talk about this," she says.

[31-Jan-2016 00:53:58]  <Rig> Let's see if I can stay connected.
[31-Jan-2016 00:54:04]  <Calica> i'm still here, just unsure about what next to say, also rig's connections issue
[31-Jan-2016 00:54:38]  <Rig> So, she's clammed up and you can't get anywhere?
[31-Jan-2016 00:55:12]  <Calica> sounds about right
[31-Jan-2016 00:56:24]  <Rig> I dunno. Make a joke about the Alliance of Magicians?
[31-Jan-2016 00:57:06]  <BGTB2005> maybe we should invite her over to Emiko's for tea and cookies :V
[31-Jan-2016 00:57:33]  <Rig> That actually might be an appropriate thing. For once.
[31-Jan-2016 00:58:04]  <IllFlower> Or interrogate Chie.
[31-Jan-2016 00:58:07]  <IllFlower> Because sister.
[31-Jan-2016 00:58:13]  <Rig> Also good.
[31-Jan-2016 00:58:25]  <Calica> yeah, that's actually not a terrible idea.  Or Chie, but that one with Satori probably?
[31-Jan-2016 00:58:27]  <Rig> Satori can start an inquisition.
[31-Jan-2016 00:59:09]  <IllFlower> Nobody expects the Satoric Inquisition!
[31-Jan-2016 01:02:20]  <IllFlower> Anyway, is this the plan?
[31-Jan-2016 01:02:28]  <IllFlower> Might want to send Ruri off in that case.
[31-Jan-2016 01:07:25]  <IllFlower> Alternatively, we can pick up with that next week since we've already done quite a bit this session.
[31-Jan-2016 01:08:52]  <Calica> either way works for me
[31-Jan-2016 01:14:34]  <BGTB2005> next week sounds good
[31-Jan-2016 01:15:13]  <IllFlower> All right, we'll wrap up for now. Thanks for playing, folks.
[31-Jan-2016 01:15:18]  <Calica> thanks for hosting
[31-Jan-2016 01:15:23]  <Rig> Thanks.
[31-Jan-2016 01:15:23]  <IllFlower> Next week we'll figure out what the hell is happening with Suzuhara. Maybe.
[31-Jan-2016 01:15:28]  <Rig> A possibility.
