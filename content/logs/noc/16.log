[30-Apr-2016 20:14:46]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | RIGHT NOW: Novus Ordo Conservatorum
[30-Apr-2016 20:15:18]  <IllFlower> Last time, our heroes had just gotten the number of our arson-plagued informant.
[30-Apr-2016 20:16:23]  <IllFlower> Also, Noriko is probably still in the hospital. Maybe she's getting better now, though.
[30-Apr-2016 20:16:51]  <Rig> Hopefully.
[30-Apr-2016 20:16:52]  <IllFlower> So what sayst we all?
[30-Apr-2016 20:18:11]  <Rig> I don't remember what the plan was now that we have a number.
[30-Apr-2016 20:18:16]  <BGTB2005> I vote for speakerphone at Noriko's hospital room
[30-Apr-2016 20:18:35]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[30-Apr-2016 20:18:52]  <Calica> there are worse ideas.  at least this one lets us all have a say :p
[30-Apr-2016 20:19:30]  <IllFlower> Suddenly, the hospital room transforms into a conference room with a barely-working telephone setup.
[30-Apr-2016 20:20:18]  <Rig> Sounds standard.
[30-Apr-2016 20:20:51]  <IllFlower> Seriously, though.
[30-Apr-2016 20:21:19]  <Calica> I mean, maybe try to arrange a meeting?
[30-Apr-2016 20:22:46]  <IllFlower> That sounds like the most eminently reasonable option.
[30-Apr-2016 20:23:04]  <IllFlower> So why are we considering it?
[30-Apr-2016 20:23:10]  <IllFlower> ... just kidding.
[30-Apr-2016 20:23:14]  <IllFlower> Someone set the scene, then.
[30-Apr-2016 20:24:36]  <Rig> Just gonna jump straight to the meeting?
[30-Apr-2016 20:25:01]  <IllFlower> Might as well.
[30-Apr-2016 20:28:54]  <Rig> Spending too much time trying to logic why Noriko's parents would let her go to a meeting with an informant after getting out of the hospital.
[30-Apr-2016 20:29:23]  *** SpruceZeus <~chatzilla@149.166-62-69.ftth.swbr.surewest.net> has left #madokamadness
[30-Apr-2016 20:29:38]  <IllFlower> Oh, not with the informant. Not yet.
[30-Apr-2016 20:29:47]  <IllFlower> Just the attempts to arrange one.
[30-Apr-2016 20:30:03]  <Rig> Ah, I misunderstood.
[30-Apr-2016 20:30:08]  <IllFlower> And, I mean, this is putatively a magical girl series, which means the parents are borderline neglecting their kids anyway.
[30-Apr-2016 20:30:23]  <Rig> Heh
[30-Apr-2016 20:31:44]  <Rig> Should we get Noriko out of the hospital now?
[30-Apr-2016 20:31:46]  <Calica> how many anime have present parents who aren't evil, anyways?
[30-Apr-2016 20:32:19]  <IllFlower> Madoka. Ish.
[30-Apr-2016 20:33:10]  <IllFlower> Rig: For all the chaos, it looks like Noriko's about to be discharged. Guess magic works better on rib fractures than anyone could have thought.

[30-Apr-2016 20:35:28]  <IllFlower> Oops.
[30-Apr-2016 20:36:06]  *** Rig <~rig@2602:306:37ff:ad40:9dd8:4e39:2bab:7278> has joined #madokamadness
[30-Apr-2016 20:36:06]  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o Rig
[30-Apr-2016 20:36:40]  <Rig> Sorry about that.
[30-Apr-2016 20:37:55]  <IllFlower> So let's say we're all in the hospital room, and Emiko's got the number.
[30-Apr-2016 20:38:05]  <Rig> Okay.
[30-Apr-2016 20:38:20]  <Calica> alright
[30-Apr-2016 20:38:48]  <BGTB2005> sounds good
[30-Apr-2016 20:38:49]  <Rig> Noriko has let the group now that she's soon to discharged.
[30-Apr-2016 20:39:25]  <Calica> Emiko explains the informant situation and how she got a hold of the number.
[30-Apr-2016 20:40:32]  <Rig> "So, we just call and set up a meeting?"
[30-Apr-2016 20:41:51]  <Calica> "I think so, unless there's any objections."
[30-Apr-2016 20:42:27]  <IllFlower> Objections like... INTERFERING WITH A POLICE INVESTIGATION??!!
[30-Apr-2016 20:42:44]  <Rig> "It seems unlikely they'd be willing to just meet with us, but it can't be the worst thing we've tried to do," Noriko says, gesturing vaguely to the hospital room.
[30-Apr-2016 20:42:59]  <Rig> IllFlower: We've done that already. The first time is the hardest.
[30-Apr-2016 20:43:13]  <Calica> I think you'll find that, according to a guy that has now played a cop in at least two(2) movies, fuck the police
[30-Apr-2016 20:44:17]  <IllFlower> Carry on, then.
[30-Apr-2016 20:46:09]  <Rig> Emiko can dial up that number then.
[30-Apr-2016 20:46:15]  <IllFlower> Rig: The hospital room doesn't gesture back.
[30-Apr-2016 20:47:23]  <Rig> ;-;
[30-Apr-2016 20:47:28]  <Rig> Senpai never notices Noriko.
[30-Apr-2016 20:47:56]  <Calica> Despite the hospital room's cold indifference to the girls, Emiko dials the number, and presses the little "Speaker" icon as the first ring comes through.
[30-Apr-2016 20:48:28]  <IllFlower> Beep.
[30-Apr-2016 20:48:34]  <IllFlower> Beep.
[30-Apr-2016 20:48:42]  <IllFlower> Beep.
[30-Apr-2016 20:48:58]  <IllFlower> Beep.
[30-Apr-2016 20:49:00]  <IllFlower> Wouldn't this call usually have gone to voicemail by now?
[30-Apr-2016 20:49:05]  <IllFlower> Beep.
[30-Apr-2016 20:49:10]  <Rig> They never set up voicemail.
[30-Apr-2016 20:49:11]  <IllFlower> "Hello?"
[30-Apr-2016 20:49:13]  <Rig> ;-;
[30-Apr-2016 20:49:56]  <IllFlower> Something about the respondent's tone sounds off. A voice changer?
[30-Apr-2016 20:50:01]  <Rig> Heh.
[30-Apr-2016 20:50:22]  <Calica> gotta hide the informant's voice from even the police
[30-Apr-2016 20:50:25]  <Rig> Should Emiko take the lead here?
[30-Apr-2016 20:50:55]  <BGTB2005> seems like a good idea
[30-Apr-2016 20:50:57]  <Calica> I can do that.  One sec.
[30-Apr-2016 20:51:15]  <Calica> "Hello.  Is this Sanada?"
[30-Apr-2016 20:52:25]  <IllFlower> "Who is this?"
[30-Apr-2016 20:52:49]  <IllFlower> Good question.
[30-Apr-2016 20:52:53]  <IllFlower> "How did you get this number?"
[30-Apr-2016 20:52:58]  <IllFlower> Also a good question.
[30-Apr-2016 20:55:48]  <Calica> "We got it from someone who knows someone.  We're people who are curious about something, something I think you know the police will struggle with, even with your help."
[30-Apr-2016 20:57:24]  <Rig> Lots of vagueness.
[30-Apr-2016 20:58:28]  <IllFlower> "What's that supposed to mean?"
[30-Apr-2016 20:58:46]  <Rig> "Maybe give them a little more to go on?" Noriko suggests.
[30-Apr-2016 20:58:48]  <IllFlower> An out-of-place *click* sounds over the line.
[30-Apr-2016 20:59:20]  <Calica> "There's something off about the fires your former group has been setting, hasn't there"?
[30-Apr-2016 20:59:26]  <Calica> question mark escaped its home

[30-Apr-2016 21:01:54]  <IllFlower> "Are you threatening me?"
[30-Apr-2016 21:04:55]  <IllFlower> Emiko glances at Noriko and Satori. Noriko sheepishly nods back: yeah, it does kinda sound like you are.
[30-Apr-2016 21:07:04]  <Calica> "I don't mean to.  If it helps, we won't tell the press, talking about magic would just throw more light on us, which is the last thing we're looking to do."
[30-Apr-2016 21:07:23]  <Calica> fuck it, tell everyone about magic :P
[30-Apr-2016 21:07:34]  <BGTB2005> what could go wrong
[30-Apr-2016 21:07:43]  <Calica> lots of things, but that's what makes it fun
[30-Apr-2016 21:07:45]  <Rig> Just start a revolution.
[30-Apr-2016 21:08:07]  <IllFlower> This conversation is getting more inexplicable by the second.
[30-Apr-2016 21:08:17]  <BGTB2005> ...so would that make us Revolutionary Girls?
[30-Apr-2016 21:08:19]  <Calica> if the chick does not break her shell, she will die without bei(ry
[30-Apr-2016 21:08:32]  <IllFlower> Couldn't you have pretended to be police or something?

[30-Apr-2016 21:10:58]  <Calica> We have a name but not much else, I think
[30-Apr-2016 21:12:50]  <IllFlower> I'm thinking this is good conflict fodder. Get our man to at least agree to meet somewhere.
[30-Apr-2016 21:13:01]  <Rig> Yeah, I think that might be fun.

[30-Apr-2016 21:34:39]  <IllFlower> To find out where he is now so maybe the Conservators can catch the fire dude.
[30-Apr-2016 21:35:01]  <Rig> Very clear.
[30-Apr-2016 21:36:43]  <IllFlower> Also to figure out if they're in the midst of some fucking fire magic.

[30-Apr-2016 22:14:05]  <Rig> @dice roll 3d4
[30-Apr-2016 22:14:05]  <Omnipresence> 14Rig: Rolled 1 2 3 = 6.
[30-Apr-2016 22:14:14]  <IllFlower> The park is busy, full of mothers with young children. Well, maybe nobody's going to get sniped in the head with this crowd.
[30-Apr-2016 22:14:15]  <Rig> Short-term and exp.
[30-Apr-2016 22:14:18]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[30-Apr-2016 22:15:41]  <IllFlower> It'd be funny if you went 1d4 temporary on conversation domination.
[30-Apr-2016 22:15:45]  <IllFlower> Overconfidence.
[30-Apr-2016 22:16:08]  <Rig> Hahaha, I was thinking of taking a temporary trait at 1d4 that was like "Kind of a jerk"
[30-Apr-2016 22:16:14]  <Rig> Or dropping Ht by 1.
[30-Apr-2016 22:16:45]  <IllFlower> That could work too.
[30-Apr-2016 22:18:34]  <Rig> Debating between bumping will up a point or increasing a trait.
[30-Apr-2016 22:18:35]  <BGTB2005> you should totally take "Kind of a jerk" as your XP
[30-Apr-2016 22:18:41]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[30-Apr-2016 22:19:21]  <Calica> ("A jerk, but gets things done.")
[30-Apr-2016 22:20:11]  <BGTB2005> well as long as she doesn't turn into Kazuki...
[30-Apr-2016 22:21:29]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[30-Apr-2016 22:21:32]  <Rig> I'll try
[30-Apr-2016 22:21:47]  <IllFlower> lol.
[30-Apr-2016 22:22:18]  <IllFlower> A man in his mid-twenties sits down on the bench next to Satori.
[30-Apr-2016 22:22:34]  <IllFlower> Well, "next to" might be a stretch. He seems to be trying not to look like he's sitting too close.
[30-Apr-2016 22:23:59]  <Calica> Satori freaks out, worried she'll have to talk.
[30-Apr-2016 22:24:01]  <Calica> (:P)
[30-Apr-2016 22:24:28]  <IllFlower> "So? Who are you?"
[30-Apr-2016 22:29:28]  <BGTB2005> (BGT freaks out, trying to figure out how to respond)
[30-Apr-2016 22:29:54]  <Calica> name, mention being in on the phone call?
[30-Apr-2016 22:30:32]  <IllFlower> I imagine the other two are there too, but this bench might be getting a bit long.
[30-Apr-2016 22:31:06]  <Rig> Yeah, I imagined they were hanging out nearby.
[30-Apr-2016 22:31:20]  <Rig> But I figured we'd give Satori a moment to shine.
[30-Apr-2016 22:31:25]  <Calica> yeah, I imagined the same, and we'll sort of hang out closer, but also that
[30-Apr-2016 22:31:49]  <Calica> maybe Satori could say a few lines then give a thumbs-up or something and the -kos will arrive closer then
[30-Apr-2016 22:33:09]  <IllFlower> Right now, the only thing shining is the radiant flustered blush of Satori's face.
[30-Apr-2016 22:38:03]  <BGTB2005> "Ah... Um... I'm Satori Nakajima, first year at Kumagawa High."
[30-Apr-2016 22:39:29]  <BGTB2005> She looks around for and motions  -- more like frantically flails -- to the others

[30-Apr-2016 22:40:25]  <Calica> Emiko slowly walks over towards Satori, making a slight hand motion intended to imply "calm yourself down a bit"

[30-Apr-2016 22:42:36]  <IllFlower> "I see."
[30-Apr-2016 22:42:52]  <IllFlower> Sanada's expression doesn't change.
[30-Apr-2016 22:42:57]  <IllFlower> "Don't mind me. I'm waiting for someone."
[30-Apr-2016 22:46:04]  <IllFlower> ("Y-You too? W-W-What a coincidence!")
[30-Apr-2016 22:46:16]  <Rig> Noriko gives up looking like she's busy with her phone and joins the group around the bench.
[30-Apr-2016 22:46:41]  <Calica> hahaha
[30-Apr-2016 22:47:24]  <Calica> Emiko also joins the group around the bench.  "Sanada?"
[30-Apr-2016 22:47:35]  <IllFlower> "So you really are a bunch of high school girls."
[30-Apr-2016 22:48:05]  <IllFlower> It's easier to hear the mildly dismissive tone in Sanada's actual voice.
[30-Apr-2016 22:50:45]  <Rig> It's not any harder for Noriko to ignore it.
[30-Apr-2016 22:50:58]  <IllFlower> "Man, oh, man, am I going to have a story to tell the next time the police check up on me."
[30-Apr-2016 22:51:29]  <Rig> "Maybe you can tell us the story you told them last time they checked up on you?"
[30-Apr-2016 22:51:54]  <IllFlower> "Which is?"
[30-Apr-2016 22:55:38]  <IllFlower> Sanada leans back on the bench. "Don't clam up on me now. You already know everything about me, don't you? I don't even know your names."
[30-Apr-2016 22:56:42]  <Rig> "We just want to know what you told the police about the fires."
[30-Apr-2016 22:58:03]  <IllFlower> "Fucking Rinzen trying to smoke me out, that's all. They don't want me talking about Adachi."
[30-Apr-2016 22:58:40]  <BGTB2005> "...Adachi?"
[30-Apr-2016 22:58:44]  <Calica> "Just you?  And who's Adachi?"
[30-Apr-2016 22:59:24]  <IllFlower> "The one thing I can't figure out is how they keep burning down all those apartments. Police are useless pieces of shit."
[30-Apr-2016 22:59:36]  <IllFlower> The words "operational security" come to mind.
[30-Apr-2016 23:00:15]  <IllFlower> "Oh, so you *don't* know? Maybe I'm not going to die after all."

[30-Apr-2016 23:03:47]  <Calica> Emiko gasps a bit, and looks to Noriko and Satori.
[30-Apr-2016 23:03:55]  <Calica> "Anything special about the killing?"
[30-Apr-2016 23:07:56]  <IllFlower> "Special? Adachi had a gun. Nasty-looking piece of work. A 9mm.
[30-Apr-2016 23:08:32]  <IllFlower> "The guy was a distributor. Deep in debt. About ten million, I think."

[30-Apr-2016 23:10:41]  <Rig> "And this made you turn informant?"
[30-Apr-2016 23:11:16]  <Calica> IllFlower: Yeah, that's what I thought, I was just curious about the "exact" number (and also looks like there's a bug :\)
[30-Apr-2016 23:11:35]  <IllFlower> "Well, I got in this business for the cash, not to become an accessory to murder."
[30-Apr-2016 23:12:28]  <IllFlower> Calica: That's WA's fault for returning bad XML...
[30-Apr-2016 23:15:29]  <Rig> "And Adachi sent Rinzen after you?"
[30-Apr-2016 23:16:22]  <IllFlower> "He doesn't want to get locked away on my account."
[30-Apr-2016 23:16:43]  <Calica> do we know who or what Rinzen is?
[30-Apr-2016 23:17:04]  <BGTB2005> IIRC all we know is it's a drug ring of some sort
[30-Apr-2016 23:18:14]  <IllFlower> Sanada was *in* Rinzen, if that wasn't clear.
[30-Apr-2016 23:18:41]  <Calica> oh, right.  Couldn't remember if Rinzen was the group's name or not
[30-Apr-2016 23:19:29]  <Rig> RIght.
[30-Apr-2016 23:20:36]  <Rig> "You haven't really mentioned the fires. Who is starting them? Who in Rinzen, I mean?"
[30-Apr-2016 23:21:41]  <IllFlower> "Dunno. Probably some grunts. If I stuck around to find out, I'd be dead."
[30-Apr-2016 23:22:41]  <Calica> "Do you have any guesses, based on who you knew when you were in there?"
[30-Apr-2016 23:24:23]  <IllFlower> "I mean, it's Adachi calling the shots, and that's what matters."
[30-Apr-2016 23:27:46]  <Rig> Should we try tracking down Adachi?
[30-Apr-2016 23:28:40]  <IllFlower> How?
[30-Apr-2016 23:28:55]  <IllFlower> The only way I can think of is by staking out Sanada's current place.
[30-Apr-2016 23:28:56]  <Rig> Maybe asking Sanada for a location?
[30-Apr-2016 23:29:00]  <Rig> Or that.
[30-Apr-2016 23:29:08]  <Rig> But stakeouts rarely work out for us.
[30-Apr-2016 23:30:13]  <IllFlower> What choice have you?
[30-Apr-2016 23:30:35]  <Rig> We could break into the police station.
[30-Apr-2016 23:30:40]  <Rig> See if they know where he is.
[30-Apr-2016 23:30:52]  <IllFlower> Where who is?
[30-Apr-2016 23:30:55]  <IllFlower> Adachi?
[30-Apr-2016 23:31:08]  <Rig> Yeah. Maybe there is some dirty cop or something.
[30-Apr-2016 23:31:23]  <IllFlower> So... breaking into a police station.
[30-Apr-2016 23:31:27]  <Rig> I'm kidding.
[30-Apr-2016 23:31:36]  <BGTB2005> I think the stakeout sounds like the better idea
[30-Apr-2016 23:31:39]  <Rig> We're saving that for the end of the arc.
[30-Apr-2016 23:32:21]  <IllFlower> `_`
[30-Apr-2016 23:32:30]  <IllFlower> Stakeout?
[30-Apr-2016 23:32:45]  <Rig> Stakeout sounds good. Do we let Sanada know we're watching him?
[30-Apr-2016 23:34:11]  <Calica> do you think he'll rat us out?
[30-Apr-2016 23:34:26]  <BGTB2005> I dunno
[30-Apr-2016 23:34:35]  <IllFlower> Anything you decide on will happen next episode, by the way. It's getting late.
[30-Apr-2016 23:34:53]  <Rig> Yeah, I kind of have been in and out for the last conversation because my girlfriend wanted to make dinner.
[30-Apr-2016 23:35:00]  <Rig> Kind of need to go eat it now.
[30-Apr-2016 23:35:09]  <IllFlower> You've gotta tell her about this.
[30-Apr-2016 23:35:12]  <Rig> I'm good with a stakeout unless someone has another idea.
[30-Apr-2016 23:35:22]  <IllFlower> "From four to seven, I'm pretending to be a sixteen-year-old girl, okay?"
[30-Apr-2016 23:35:27]  <Rig> She is aware.
[30-Apr-2016 23:35:32]  <Rig> However, hunger is hunger.
[30-Apr-2016 23:35:36]  <IllFlower> And she hasn't left you? Bless her heart.
[30-Apr-2016 23:35:44]  <Rig> And it is now 7:35.
[30-Apr-2016 23:35:57]  <BGTB2005> I need to go pick up dinner
[30-Apr-2016 23:36:00]  <IllFlower> CALICA AND BGTB2005 MAKE A DECISION ALREADY
[30-Apr-2016 23:36:25]  <BGTB2005> I like the stakeout plan
[30-Apr-2016 23:36:27]  <Calica> I'm good with a stakeout.  Not sure whether Sanada should know.
[30-Apr-2016 23:36:37]  <Rig> Let's keep him in the dark then.
[30-Apr-2016 23:36:46]  <IllFlower> So it shall be.
[30-Apr-2016 23:36:53]  <Rig> He probably wouldn't gain much comfort from being watched by some high school girls.
[30-Apr-2016 23:36:55]  <IllFlower> We'll pick up next time. Thanks again.
[30-Apr-2016 23:37:03]  <Rig> Thanks for running the session, IllFlower.
[30-Apr-2016 23:37:03]  <IllFlower> Isn't it usually the other way around?
[30-Apr-2016 23:37:07]  <Calica> Thanks for running
[30-Apr-2016 23:37:13]  <Calica> IllFlower: I was about to say, isn't that the opposite of the usual worry
