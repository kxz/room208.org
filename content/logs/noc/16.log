@time=2016-04-30T20:15:18.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Last time, our heroes had just gotten the number of our arson-plagued informant.
@time=2016-04-30T20:16:23.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Also, Noriko is probably still in the hospital. Maybe she's getting better now, though.
@time=2016-04-30T20:16:51.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hopefully.
@time=2016-04-30T20:16:52.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So what sayst we all?
@time=2016-04-30T20:18:11.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I don't remember what the plan was now that we have a number.
@time=2016-04-30T20:18:16.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I vote for speakerphone at Noriko's hospital room
@time=2016-04-30T20:18:35.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Hahaha.
@time=2016-04-30T20:18:52.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :there are worse ideas.  at least this one lets us all have a say :p
@time=2016-04-30T20:19:30.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Suddenly, the hospital room transforms into a conference room with a barely-working telephone setup.
@time=2016-04-30T20:20:18.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Sounds standard.
@time=2016-04-30T20:20:51.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Seriously, though.
@time=2016-04-30T20:21:19.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I mean, maybe try to arrange a meeting?
@time=2016-04-30T20:22:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :That sounds like the most eminently reasonable option.
@time=2016-04-30T20:23:04.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So why are we considering it?
@time=2016-04-30T20:23:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :... just kidding.
@time=2016-04-30T20:23:14.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Someone set the scene, then.
@time=2016-04-30T20:24:36.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just gonna jump straight to the meeting?
@time=2016-04-30T20:25:01.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Might as well.
@time=2016-04-30T20:28:54.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Spending too much time trying to logic why Noriko's parents would let her go to a meeting with an informant after getting out of the hospital.

@time=2016-04-30T20:29:47.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Just the attempts to arrange one.
@time=2016-04-30T20:30:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Ah, I misunderstood.
@time=2016-04-30T20:30:08.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And, I mean, this is putatively a magical girl series, which means the parents are borderline neglecting their kids anyway.

@time=2016-04-30T20:31:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Should we get Noriko out of the hospital now?

@time=2016-04-30T20:33:10.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Rig: For all the chaos, it looks like Noriko's about to be discharged. Guess magic works better on rib fractures than anyone could have thought.

@time=2016-04-30T23:32:45.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Stakeout sounds good. Do we let Sanada know we're watching him?
@time=2016-04-30T23:34:11.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :do you think he'll rat us out?
@time=2016-04-30T23:34:26.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I dunno
@time=2016-04-30T23:34:35.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Anything you decide on will happen next episode, by the way. It's getting late.
@time=2016-04-30T23:34:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Yeah, I kind of have been in and out for the last conversation because my girlfriend wanted to make dinner.
@time=2016-04-30T23:35:00.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Kind of need to go eat it now.
@time=2016-04-30T23:35:09.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :You've gotta tell her about this.
@time=2016-04-30T23:35:12.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm good with a stakeout unless someone has another idea.
@time=2016-04-30T23:35:22.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"From four to seven, I'm pretending to be a sixteen-year-old girl, okay?"
@time=2016-04-30T23:35:27.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :She is aware.
@time=2016-04-30T23:35:32.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :However, hunger is hunger.
@time=2016-04-30T23:35:36.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And she hasn't left you? Bless her heart.
@time=2016-04-30T23:35:44.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :And it is now 7:35.
@time=2016-04-30T23:35:57.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I need to go pick up dinner
@time=2016-04-30T23:36:00.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :CALICA AND BGTB2005 MAKE A DECISION ALREADY
@time=2016-04-30T23:36:25.000Z :BGTB2005 PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I like the stakeout plan
@time=2016-04-30T23:36:27.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :I'm good with a stakeout.  Not sure whether Sanada should know.
@time=2016-04-30T23:36:37.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Let's keep him in the dark then.
@time=2016-04-30T23:36:46.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :So it shall be.
@time=2016-04-30T23:36:53.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He probably wouldn't gain much comfort from being watched by some high school girls.
@time=2016-04-30T23:36:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :We'll pick up next time. Thanks again.
@time=2016-04-30T23:37:03.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for running the session, IllFlower.
@time=2016-04-30T23:37:03.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Isn't it usually the other way around?
@time=2016-04-30T23:37:07.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Thanks for running
@time=2016-04-30T23:37:13.000Z :Calica PRIVMSG #madokamadness :IllFlower: I was about to say, isn't that the opposite of the usual worry
