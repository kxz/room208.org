[27-Feb-2016 21:04:42]  <IllFlower> All right, we'll get started in just a couple of minutes.
[27-Feb-2016 21:05:44]  <IllFlower> I don't think we did reflection fallout from last time, so let's start with that.
[27-Feb-2016 21:06:04]  <Calica> I didn't, at least
[27-Feb-2016 21:06:07]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | RIGHT NOW: Novus Ordo Conservatorum
[27-Feb-2016 21:07:26]  <Rig> Yeah, I think we need to clarify what our characters learned from the last arc.
[27-Feb-2016 21:07:49]  <BGTB2005> We Suck At Talking?
[27-Feb-2016 21:08:24]  <Rig> I think Noriko feels kind of beaten down by everything that happened. She basically talked a big game and got told that she was bad at talking a big game and even worse at backing it up.
[27-Feb-2016 21:09:46]  <IllFlower> Having high Ac ain't everything.
[27-Feb-2016 21:09:47]  <Rig> Maybe adding a die to "I know what I'm doing"?
[27-Feb-2016 21:10:31]  <IllFlower> Did you ever use that trait?
[27-Feb-2016 21:10:42]  <IllFlower> I recall you doing so once but I might be wrong.
[27-Feb-2016 21:10:54]  <IllFlower> Totally justified, though.
[27-Feb-2016 21:11:20]  <Calica> I'm not entirely sure what Emiko should have learned from this arc
[27-Feb-2016 21:11:32]  <Rig> I used it once in desperation.
[27-Feb-2016 21:12:12]  <Rig> Calica: I think the stuff I remember most about Emiko is she was kinda nosey and engaged in some subterfuge-ish things with Satori's sister.
[27-Feb-2016 21:12:13]  <IllFlower> Calica: Gotta use more of that charm offensive.
[27-Feb-2016 21:12:28]  <Calica> IllFlower: yeah I think the charm offensive wasn't quite charming enough
[27-Feb-2016 21:12:30]  <IllFlower> Stop letting Noriko do that shit, she's not good at it.
[27-Feb-2016 21:12:39]  <Calica> also that
[27-Feb-2016 21:12:46]  <Rig> 1d6 I won't let Noriko talk
[27-Feb-2016 21:13:40]  <BGTB2005> I'm thinking of adding a die to Barrier Magic
[27-Feb-2016 21:14:47]  <IllFlower> I dunno if the barrier magic *really* worked for its intended purpose.
[27-Feb-2016 21:15:53]  <Calica> Rig: and yeah, she did end up kinda nosey, though I guess that's kind of a requirement for Dogs.
[27-Feb-2016 21:16:29]  <Rig> True, but you could make it part of her character.
[27-Feb-2016 21:16:33]  <Rig> Minmax your dogs.
[27-Feb-2016 21:16:38]  <IllFlower> I think it would have worked if she'd been more subtle about it.
[27-Feb-2016 21:16:43]  <IllFlower> She can make anyone talk.
[27-Feb-2016 21:16:53]  <Rig> That's a good trait.
[27-Feb-2016 21:17:01]  <IllFlower> Kixenmonogatari: 1,1à la Ougi
[27-Feb-2016 21:17:18]  <Kixenmonogatari> oooo
[27-Feb-2016 21:18:21]  <Rig> I dunno if the thing I remember most about Satori is actually a reflection of Satori or just a sign that she's not Rin.
[27-Feb-2016 21:18:30]  <IllFlower> Rig: Noriko did cut a deal with Akamine. So that probably counts for something.
[27-Feb-2016 21:18:32]  <Rig> I was like "Well, Satori didn't kill anyone."
[27-Feb-2016 21:19:09]  <Calica> 13:16 <@IllFlower> I think it would have worked if she'd been more subtle about it. <---the "she" here being Emiko, still?
[27-Feb-2016 21:19:15]  <BGTB2005> Rin didn't either
[27-Feb-2016 21:19:24]  <Rig> Akamine? I though the deal was with Minase?
[27-Feb-2016 21:19:59]  <IllFlower> Oops, yes.
[27-Feb-2016 21:20:04]  <IllFlower> Got my own delinquents confused.
[27-Feb-2016 21:20:15]  <Rig> Heh.
[27-Feb-2016 21:20:16]  <IllFlower> Calica: Yes.
[27-Feb-2016 21:20:28]  *** Haruspex <~Glossina@188-64-212-66.spl.org> has joined #madokamadness
[27-Feb-2016 21:20:47]  *** Kixenmonogatari <~xeniera@usc-secure-wireless-088-112.usc.edu> has quit IRC (Remote host closed the connection)
[27-Feb-2016 21:22:06]  <Calica> though "she should learn to be more subtle" could probably be turned into a good reflection fallout
[27-Feb-2016 21:22:37]  <Calica> oops, i didn't actually say "I worry that the lack of subtlety might be a player issue rather than a character one" before that
[27-Feb-2016 21:23:30]  <IllFlower> hahaha
[27-Feb-2016 21:23:43]  <IllFlower> I dunno, what were her conflicts?
[27-Feb-2016 21:23:54]  <IllFlower> Mayumi, yeah? And then of course the younger Suzuhara.
[27-Feb-2016 21:24:56]  <Calica> yeah, I think those were the big ones?
[27-Feb-2016 21:26:34]  <IllFlower> I think you mostly got really unlucky in the former.
[27-Feb-2016 21:26:55]  <IllFlower> Maybe "it's better to try than not try at all."
[27-Feb-2016 21:27:28]  <Calica> "it's better to try than to let Noriko do it" :p
[27-Feb-2016 21:27:35]  <BGTB2005> pff
[27-Feb-2016 21:27:42]  <Rig> A good idea.
[27-Feb-2016 21:28:46]  <IllFlower> ha
[27-Feb-2016 21:30:18]  <Calica> New traits in Reflection are always 1d6?
[27-Feb-2016 21:30:33]  <IllFlower> Yes.
[27-Feb-2016 21:31:43]  <Calica> that's one down
[27-Feb-2016 21:32:42]  <Rig> Oh, right. There is one more pick.
[27-Feb-2016 21:33:18]  <IllFlower> Rig: Did you already select something?
[27-Feb-2016 21:33:32]  <Rig> I went with adding a die to "I know what I'm doing"
[27-Feb-2016 21:33:42]  <IllFlower> Ah, see it now.
[27-Feb-2016 21:33:49]  <Rig> I was thinking I'd roll down the relationship with Mr. Tamura to 1d4 as well.
[27-Feb-2016 21:34:36]  <IllFlower> 'Cause she's torn on it. Makes sense.
[27-Feb-2016 21:36:35]  <IllFlower> Satori was mostly putting people in a box, right?
[27-Feb-2016 21:36:51]  <BGTB2005> Following people around and using magic
[27-Feb-2016 21:37:30]  <IllFlower> Maybe you roll down "not good with morally grey situations" to d4 and reword it as "quick to judgment" or somesuch.
[27-Feb-2016 21:37:42]  <IllFlower> Rig: Did you ever use conversation domination?
[27-Feb-2016 21:38:17]  <Rig> Once or twice.
[27-Feb-2016 21:38:53]  <IllFlower> Ah, against Chie.
[27-Feb-2016 21:39:41]  <BGTB2005> when I first thought of the trait, I was kinda thinking she had a black-and-white sort of morality
[27-Feb-2016 21:39:43]  <Rig> A few of Noriko's traits are a bit hard to use.
[27-Feb-2016 21:40:16]  <IllFlower> They are a bit weirdly bespoke.
[27-Feb-2016 21:40:18]  <Calica> same with Emiko's talking over and baking traits, but the latter I just need to get into a situation where I can promise to bake for a friend later clearly
[27-Feb-2016 21:40:33]  <IllFlower> I think you can reinterpret some of them, though.
[27-Feb-2016 21:40:51]  <BGTB2005> we should try interrogating people over tea and cookies
[27-Feb-2016 21:40:56]  <IllFlower> "I have a refined fashion sense" becomes a way to allay suspicion, make people underestimate her, etc.
[27-Feb-2016 21:41:13]  <IllFlower> Reading is good for factive knowledge. Or making up bullshit.
[27-Feb-2016 21:41:38]  <IllFlower> And then the dog lover is... okay, that's pretty weirdly bespoke.
[27-Feb-2016 21:42:09]  <Rig> :P
[27-Feb-2016 21:42:33]  <Calica> @define bespoke
[27-Feb-2016 21:42:34]  <Omnipresence> 14Calica: Wolfram|Alpha: Input interpretation: bespoke  (English word) | definition — Result: adjective | (of clothing) custom‐made
[27-Feb-2016 21:43:04]  <IllFlower> "specially tailored for certain situations"
[27-Feb-2016 21:44:03]  <IllFlower> Rig: If you turned the dog thing around to something to actively deploy in conversations, I think it'd be a lot easier.
[27-Feb-2016 21:44:35]  <Rig> "Do you like dogs? I like dogs. You know dogs are a good indicator of trust."
[27-Feb-2016 21:45:04]  <IllFlower> Or, just, like, "knows how to make bullshit small talk about cute animals."
[27-Feb-2016 21:46:19]  <Rig> Show them pictures of dogs on her phone to distract them.
[27-Feb-2016 21:46:25]  <IllFlower> You'd have to play it in narratively appropriate circumstances, but it'd be a good way to get the trust of strangers.
[27-Feb-2016 21:46:35]  <IllFlower> Or at least her peers.
[27-Feb-2016 21:47:18]  <Rig> Yeah.
[27-Feb-2016 21:48:51]  <IllFlower> Calica: Did you do a second thing?
[27-Feb-2016 21:49:15]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: You still have to do a first thing. :p
[27-Feb-2016 21:50:02]  <Calica> IllFlower: Not yet.  Thinking maybe a relationship change but not sure which relationship would have been played off most.  Noriko?
[27-Feb-2016 21:50:02]  <BGTB2005> Hmm...
[27-Feb-2016 21:50:44]  <IllFlower> Thinking: I feel like your characters didn't work together that much except when Rei was trying to fry everyone.
[27-Feb-2016 21:51:34]  <Rig> Yeah, we kind of did our own things a lot.
[27-Feb-2016 21:52:02]  <BGTB2005> I'll bump 'not good with morally grey' down to 1d4
[27-Feb-2016 21:52:49]  <BGTB2005> not sure if I want to go with the suggested rewording, or if 'quick to judge' would be better as a separate trait
[27-Feb-2016 21:52:58]  <IllFlower> Oh, and the confrontation with Akamine, though really Noriko was the person of interest there.
[27-Feb-2016 21:53:09]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: It'd be kind of the same thing split over two different traits.
[27-Feb-2016 21:53:24]  <BGTB2005> hm
[27-Feb-2016 21:54:08]  <BGTB2005> yeah I'll go with the rewording
[27-Feb-2016 21:55:59]  <IllFlower> Rig: Did you want to reword your traits at all?
[27-Feb-2016 21:56:40]  <Rig> Maybe the dog one. Something about winning people over with cute animals?
[27-Feb-2016 21:57:47]  <IllFlower> Sounds reasonable.
[27-Feb-2016 21:58:01]  <Calica> The other question would be, if the focus is Noriko, should the dice go up or down
[27-Feb-2016 21:58:01]  <IllFlower> Oh, Noriko also has the knife. Might be a good belonging.
[27-Feb-2016 21:58:24]  <Calica> I can think of reasons for both
[27-Feb-2016 21:58:31]  <IllFlower> I sense some discord between the two of them, really.
[27-Feb-2016 21:58:44]  <IllFlower> Or at least it would be justifiable in upcoming arcs.
[27-Feb-2016 21:59:34]  <IllFlower> You can add unassigned relationship dice per p. 122, as well. Dunno how you'd justify that, though.
[27-Feb-2016 21:59:41]  <IllFlower> "and her heart grew three sizes that day"
[27-Feb-2016 22:00:00]  <IllFlower> Actually, you can do it for strong negative feelings toward someone else, too.
[27-Feb-2016 22:00:33]  <Calica> Maybe strong negative feelings for Suzuhara/Akamine/etc but did Suzuhara disappear?
[27-Feb-2016 22:00:47]  <IllFlower> You didn't read the feedback doc, did you. :p
[27-Feb-2016 22:01:11]  <Calica> oops, lol
[27-Feb-2016 22:01:22]  *** JDAM|ThinkPad <~Arisaka@667f-d68c-6059-0a07-0868-64ed-a420-2062.6rd.ip6.sonic.net> has joined #madokamadness
[27-Feb-2016 22:04:32]  <IllFlower> I'm trying to cut down on the number of characters that only show up once, in any case.
[27-Feb-2016 22:04:59]  <Rig> I think we did a pretty good job only introducing character's that'll stick around.
[27-Feb-2016 22:05:15]  <Rig> I mean, Akamine's gang is super nebulous in my head, but I could name all the major characters this time.
[27-Feb-2016 22:05:16]  <Calica> thought on Noriko: possibly slow-burning rivalry.  But also negative feelings brewing towards Suzuhara, though I could also use existing dice for that probably (unless I wanted to use d4s)
[27-Feb-2016 22:05:57]  <IllFlower> Calica, BGTB2005: You've gotta work something out for the boyfriend/best friend relationships you've got, while you're at it.
[27-Feb-2016 22:06:28]  <IllFlower> I can assign names, but I need a general idea of who these people are.
[27-Feb-2016 22:07:28]  <Calica> hmmmm
[27-Feb-2016 22:08:00]  <IllFlower> Calica: One of the between-town options is 2d4 + any single die to rels.
[27-Feb-2016 22:10:46]  <Calica> yeah, I think I might do that and then assign the d4s to Suzuhara
[27-Feb-2016 22:13:13]  <IllFlower> Sounds good.
[27-Feb-2016 22:13:48]  * Calica checks Summary to make sure Rei's the older one
[27-Feb-2016 22:13:53]  <IllFlower> Yeah.
[27-Feb-2016 22:15:39]  <Calica> now all I have left is to decide what I want to do with the boyfriend
[27-Feb-2016 22:15:43]  <BGTB2005> For Satori's best friend, I'm thinking either Emiko (because cookies) or maybe someone on the track team
[27-Feb-2016 22:16:15]  <BGTB2005> also, unless the rewording counted as two, I think I still have one more reflection to figure out
[27-Feb-2016 22:16:22]  <IllFlower> If it were Emiko, though, I think it really needs to come out in the roleplaying.
[27-Feb-2016 22:16:30]  <Calica> worst idea: Emiko's boyfriend is secretly Takumi
[27-Feb-2016 22:16:36]  <BGTB2005> hahaha
[27-Feb-2016 22:16:36]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[27-Feb-2016 22:18:55]  <BGTB2005> hmmm...
[27-Feb-2016 22:19:10]  <IllFlower> Do you want a love triangle arc? This is how you get a love triangle arc.
[27-Feb-2016 22:19:44]  <Rig> I mean, that seems like a bad idea.
[27-Feb-2016 22:19:47]  <Rig> But at the same time...
[27-Feb-2016 22:19:49]  <BGTB2005> Maybe Takumi could be Satori's friend?
[27-Feb-2016 22:19:57]  <Rig> We could get a beach episode.
[27-Feb-2016 22:20:01]  <Calica> If I did that, I assume it'd end with magical pistols at dawn
[27-Feb-2016 22:20:20]  <BGTB2005> I'm not seeing the downsides to that
[27-Feb-2016 22:20:41]  <IllFlower> Wasn't Takumi doing track anyway?
[27-Feb-2016 22:21:46]  <Rig> I believe so.
[27-Feb-2016 22:21:46]  <BGTB2005> Yeah?
[27-Feb-2016 22:22:07]  <IllFlower> So maybe it's more of a captain respect thing.
[27-Feb-2016 22:22:20]  <IllFlower> Takumi's not the president of the student council, right? Just a representative.
[27-Feb-2016 22:24:34]  <Rig> That's what I thought.
[27-Feb-2016 22:24:52]  <IllFlower> So maybe he's, like, the vice captain of the track and field club.
[27-Feb-2016 22:25:55]  <IllFlower> I can buy that being a 1d10 relationship for a member of the club as Satori is.
[27-Feb-2016 22:26:24]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005: I could also buy Wl +1. That is kind of what Satori's role was last arc...
[27-Feb-2016 22:31:14]  <IllFlower> ping
[27-Feb-2016 22:32:07]  <BGTB2005> That sounded good, so I bumped Wl +1 to 3
[27-Feb-2016 22:32:36]  <Calica> Is the boyfriend thing something the arc is going to depend on or do I have time?
[27-Feb-2016 22:32:41]  <IllFlower> Will: existent.
[27-Feb-2016 22:32:47]  <IllFlower> Calica: Depends on whether you do it now.
[27-Feb-2016 22:33:35]  <Calica> fair enough.  I may need more time to think and don't want to hold the arc up over it so >_>
[27-Feb-2016 22:34:13]  <BGTB2005> Could/should I adjust Satori's 1d10 relationship?
[27-Feb-2016 22:35:06]  <IllFlower> I'd recommend doing it sooner than later.
[27-Feb-2016 22:35:26]  <Calica> er, hold the session up over it
[27-Feb-2016 22:37:03]  <IllFlower> Okay, we've got less than an hour, so let's get kicking.
[27-Feb-2016 22:37:46]  <IllFlower> The girls are in a café, trying to sort out the potential consequences of their confrontation with Akamine.
[27-Feb-2016 22:39:11]  <IllFlower> For the time being, they've agreed to not spend too much time alone. They may have magic, but better to not be in a situation where they'd have to use it.
[27-Feb-2016 22:39:44]  <Rig> Implementing a buddy system.
[27-Feb-2016 22:41:02]  <IllFlower> School is starting late today. A water main burst outside the Kumagawa front gates overnight, and the city crews are making the last repairs.
[27-Feb-2016 22:41:36]  <IllFlower> Talking time!
[27-Feb-2016 22:43:24]  <IllFlower> Or silent time, I guess.
[27-Feb-2016 22:43:33]  <BGTB2005> Satori's fine with silent time
[27-Feb-2016 22:43:44]  <Rig> Sorry, trying to figure out a good place to start a conversation that is like "He's totally willing to do very illegal things."
[27-Feb-2016 22:43:50]  <IllFlower> All three of them can just exchange significant glances at each other while the rest of the café wonders what the fuck is up with them.
[27-Feb-2016 22:44:19]  <Rig> "Akamine isn't afraid to send freshmen after you with knives," Noriko says, still bothered by the attack in the student council room.
[27-Feb-2016 22:45:32]  <Calica> we know about that attack, right?
[27-Feb-2016 22:45:37]  <IllFlower> Now you do.
[27-Feb-2016 22:46:07]  <Rig> Let's assume Noriko was sparse on the original details.
[27-Feb-2016 22:46:51]  <IllFlower> You guys gotta communicate more.
[27-Feb-2016 22:47:26]  <Calica> "Knives, and you got away.  Let's hope that doesn't make him too angry, then, or it could be more than the one."
[27-Feb-2016 22:48:58]  <Rig> "I don't think they'd be willing to come after us if we're in a group. The first guy waited until Takumi left me alone."
[27-Feb-2016 22:51:59]  <IllFlower> Hm, or maybe that was all the effort he thought he'd need to expend.
[27-Feb-2016 22:53:56]  <IllFlower> Anyway, if there isn't much else to discuss, we can pick up.
[27-Feb-2016 22:54:26]  <Calica> i don't have anything pressing, at least.  Rig?  BGTB2005?
[27-Feb-2016 22:54:37]  <Rig> Not that I can think of without some input.
[27-Feb-2016 22:55:07]  <BGTB2005> Got nothing
[27-Feb-2016 22:55:41]  <IllFlower> Okay, let's fast-forward.
[27-Feb-2016 22:55:53]  <IllFlower> It's ten o'clock, and classes are finally starting for the day.
[27-Feb-2016 22:56:22]  <IllFlower> Noriko slides into her seat, already exhausted.
[27-Feb-2016 22:56:54]  <IllFlower> The homeroom teacher comes up to the front and claps his hands. "All right, everyone, settle down. We've got to make up for lost time."
[27-Feb-2016 22:57:42]  <IllFlower> He takes a look around the class. "Good, nobody absent today.
[27-Feb-2016 22:57:49]  <Rig> A first.
[27-Feb-2016 22:58:05]  <IllFlower> "Before you go to your third period classes, I have an announcement to make.
[27-Feb-2016 22:58:55]  <IllFlower> "One of the teachers found a dangerous object in a student's school bag yesterday afternoon. I won't go into detail, but suffice it to say we've been asked as teachers to perform bag inspections today.
[27-Feb-2016 22:59:05]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[27-Feb-2016 22:59:08]  <IllFlower> "Please open your bags and put them on your desks. This will only take a few minutes."
[27-Feb-2016 22:59:18]  <Calica> I forget, are the three students in the same class?
[27-Feb-2016 22:59:36]  <BGTB2005> the Conservators?
[27-Feb-2016 22:59:49]  <Rig> They are, I believe.
[27-Feb-2016 22:59:52]  <IllFlower> We never came to a conclusion on that. Your call.
[27-Feb-2016 23:00:01]  <Calica> BGTB2005: yeah, the conservators, heh
[27-Feb-2016 23:00:15]  <Rig> I think it'd be better if they were.
[27-Feb-2016 23:00:17]  <BGTB2005> I thought they were
[27-Feb-2016 23:00:24]  <Calica> yeah, it'd probably be better
[27-Feb-2016 23:00:25]  <Rig> I imagined them being in class together.
[27-Feb-2016 23:00:43]  <Rig> So, Noriko still has the knife in her bag.
[27-Feb-2016 23:00:52]  <IllFlower> It'd be incredibly suspicious to go rifling around now, but...
[27-Feb-2016 23:01:16]  <Rig> What kind of knife was it? Did we ever specify?
[27-Feb-2016 23:01:38]  <IllFlower> Good thing the other two know about it, and have names that come before Hisakawa...
[27-Feb-2016 23:01:50]  <Rig> Should we do this as a conflict?
[27-Feb-2016 23:01:54]  <IllFlower> Yes.
[27-Feb-2016 23:02:10]  <IllFlower> Stakes are whether the teacher finds out. Physical.
[27-Feb-2016 23:02:11]  <Rig> Noriko glances over at Emiko, trying to see if she realizes the situation she's in.
[27-Feb-2016 23:02:18]  <IllFlower> I'll raise.
[27-Feb-2016 23:02:38]  <Calica> Physical is Bd+Ht, right?
[27-Feb-2016 23:02:53]  <IllFlower> Yes. And I think this is Noriko's conflict, though she can pull the others in.

[27-Feb-2016 23:07:24]  <IllFlower> Mr. Tsukimoto actually appears to be thoroughly checking bags. Noriko remembers the time he spotted the print on a novel one of the boys was sneakily reading in the back of the class. Wasn't homeroom usually supposed to be five minutes? Agh.

[27-Feb-2016 23:09:16]  <IllFlower> Think of it as a psychological thing, if you want.
[27-Feb-2016 23:10:10]  <Rig> Noriko tries to relax. She's got a stellar record of being on the right side of things. Maybe he'll just give her bag a cursory look. She's on the student council after all.

[27-Feb-2016 23:12:54]  <Rig> Mr. Tsukimoto goes to check Emiko's bag, pulling out a bottle of tea. Noriko tries to be inconspicuous as she desperately tries to get Emiko's attention. She's unclear whether Emiko got the idea or if she just slipped when she goes to take a sip of the tea and ends up dropping it. The bottle splashes off the desk and onto Mr. Tsukimoto, dousing his pants. Some of the kids start to laugh.

[27-Feb-2016 23:14:31]  <Rig> Yeah, I thought we'd ruled earlier that that counted.
[27-Feb-2016 23:14:49]  <Calica> probably, I was just confused for a second
[27-Feb-2016 23:15:21]  <IllFlower> lol
[27-Feb-2016 23:15:25]  <IllFlower> Nice one.
[27-Feb-2016 23:16:08]  <Rig> It was either that or she has a bag of cookies on her that she bribes him with.
[27-Feb-2016 23:17:08]  <BGTB2005> I dunno if bribery's going to work on him
[27-Feb-2016 23:17:22]  <Calica> stall for time by letting him have a cookie
[27-Feb-2016 23:17:37]  <IllFlower> "I didn't think you'd be so clumsy, Azuma," Mr. Tsukimoto says, laughing.
[27-Feb-2016 23:17:39]  <Rig> If you give a Tsukimoto a cookie, he'll ask for a glass of milk.
[27-Feb-2016 23:18:11]  <IllFlower> I'm going to assign 1d8 to "composed veteran teacher."
[27-Feb-2016 23:18:11]  <Rig> Oh no, he has the "No Shame" trait.

[27-Feb-2016 23:20:55]  <IllFlower> The mood in the classroom seems to ease a bit. Shit. This is just making the bag inspections go faster. At this rate, Noriko can't even count on the school bell to help her out.

[27-Feb-2016 23:23:27]  <BGTB2005> perhaps Noriko's got a bunch of books to read in her spare time with her?
[27-Feb-2016 23:23:40]  <Rig> Yeah, but first I've gotta see this raise somehow.
[27-Feb-2016 23:25:17]  <Rig> Noriko glances at the clock, willing it go faster. Luckily one of the students before her seems to have confused his bookbag with a trashbag and Mr. Tsukimoto is having some difficulty sorting through it.

She shifts her open bag on the table, trying to nonchalant about it as she gets her stack of "light" reading material to cover where she thinks the knife is. Maybe he won't give her more than a quick glance?

[27-Feb-2016 23:33:13]  <IllFlower> Tsukimoto rifles around in the bag with one hand. Maybe he's just trying to maintain appearances. He doesn't want to seem too obviously--
[27-Feb-2016 23:33:44]  <IllFlower> A sound of pain. He lifts his hand out. There's a small red line across two of his fingers. Oh God.

[27-Feb-2016 23:34:51]  <IllFlower> Hold your horses.
[27-Feb-2016 23:35:18]  <Rig> I love to, but I am sort of running late for something now. :P

[27-Feb-2016 23:35:29]  <IllFlower> Wrap, rather.
[27-Feb-2016 23:35:49]  <IllFlower> Tsukimoto looks closely at the bag and sees something glinting at the bottom.
[27-Feb-2016 23:35:55]  <IllFlower> He fires Noriko a significant look.
[27-Feb-2016 23:35:57]  <IllFlower> Shit. Shit.
[27-Feb-2016 23:36:20]  <IllFlower> "Can I see you in the staff room?" he asks, knowing Noriko has no choice but to answer "yes."
[27-Feb-2016 23:36:36]  <IllFlower> He moves on to the handful of students still remaining.
[27-Feb-2016 23:36:45]  <IllFlower> Okay, done. We can do a follow-up next time.
[27-Feb-2016 23:36:54]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, everyone! See you in a week.
[27-Feb-2016 23:36:54]  <Rig> Cool. This was a fun conflict.
