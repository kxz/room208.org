@time=2016-02-27T23:32:48.000Z :Rig PRIVMSG #madokamadness :"Gotta go fast" Tsukimoto whispers to himself as he overturns Noriko's bag.
@time=2016-02-27T23:33:13.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Tsukimoto rifles around in the bag with one hand. Maybe he's just trying to maintain appearances. He doesn't want to seem too obviously--
@time=2016-02-27T23:33:44.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :A sound of pain. He lifts his hand out. There's a small red line across two of his fingers. Oh God.

@time=2016-02-27T23:35:29.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Wrap, rather.
@time=2016-02-27T23:35:49.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Tsukimoto looks closely at the bag and sees something glinting at the bottom.
@time=2016-02-27T23:35:55.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :He fires Noriko a significant look.
@time=2016-02-27T23:35:57.000Z :IllFlower PRIVMSG #madokamadness :Shit. Shit.
