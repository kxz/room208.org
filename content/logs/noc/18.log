[21-May-2016 20:03:42]  *** IllFlower changes topic to https://wiki.room208.org/events | RIGHT NOW: Novus Ordo Conservatorum
[21-May-2016 20:04:41]  <IllFlower> All right, we left off with trying to get the jump on our mysterious arsonist.
[21-May-2016 20:05:06]  <IllFlower> Looks like Satori's in a position to ambush, but Noriko and Emiko might be in a bit of a pinch.
[21-May-2016 20:05:48]  <Rig> Sounds right.
[21-May-2016 20:06:45]  <IllFlower> Cool. I guess I'll raise first.
[21-May-2016 20:07:37]  <IllFlower> We'll start at talking for now. I don't think our man is crazy enough to just set two girls aflame.
[21-May-2016 20:07:43]  <Rig> What are the stakes?
[21-May-2016 20:07:49]  <Calica> And who are the combatants?
[21-May-2016 20:08:00]  <IllFlower> Our man's stakes are getting to set the apartment on fire.
[21-May-2016 20:08:07]  <IllFlower> Your stakes... probably stopping him, for now.
[21-May-2016 20:09:15]  <Rig> That makes sense.
[21-May-2016 20:09:54]  <IllFlower> Combatants are up to you.
[21-May-2016 20:10:02]  <IllFlower> I imagine everyone will be participating, though.

[21-May-2016 20:42:45]  <Calica> do we all have to contribute a line or do we just need dice

[21-May-2016 20:54:53]  <BGTB2005> I feel like the simplest solution here would be for Satori to plant a magic barrier for the guy to run into (again)
[21-May-2016 20:55:12]  <IllFlower> You could optionally escalate to punching.
[21-May-2016 20:57:36]  <Rig> With Rin the punching was never optional.
[21-May-2016 20:57:56]  <IllFlower> Or just try to block his path.
[21-May-2016 20:58:01]  <IllFlower> Which wouldn't need an escalation.
[21-May-2016 21:05:53]  <BGTB2005> From her vantage point, Satori chants an incantation to block the next landing with a barrier
[21-May-2016 21:05:58]  <Rig> I'd probably go without the escalation, yeah.

[21-May-2016 21:07:59]  <IllFlower> BGTB2005, I think you still haven't rolled for the new level, physical at least. I kinda struggle with seeing a barrier as anything lower than hand-to-hand, though.

[21-May-2016 21:42:21]  <IllFlower> Still need a see.

[21-May-2016 21:47:59]  <Rig> BGTB2005: Any ideas for a see?
[21-May-2016 21:48:40]  <BGTB2005> still not sure what to go with; Satori holding her ground or letting him by
[21-May-2016 21:49:08]  <IllFlower> Flip a coin.
[21-May-2016 21:51:09]  <BGTB2005> hmm, I think I have an idea
[21-May-2016 21:53:02]  <BGTB2005> Whether paralysed with fear or bolstered by reckless bravery, Satori doesn't budge
[21-May-2016 21:53:10]  <BGTB2005> @dice use 4 6

[21-May-2016 21:56:01]  <Calica> I'm split between trying to do some sort of magical demonstration to scare him and asking him if he really wants to shoot a high school girl
[21-May-2016 21:56:36]  <Rig> The time for talking is a bit past, but the effort is commendable.
[21-May-2016 21:57:00]  <Calica> haha
[21-May-2016 21:57:01]  <Calica> true
[21-May-2016 21:59:53]  <Calica> Emiko begins to chant something and small rocks and such begin to start swirling around her slowly.  "Are you really sure you want to do this?"  The time for secrecy passed the moment he pulled out a gun, and besides who would really believe that testimony?
[21-May-2016 22:00:17]  <Calica> (except I guess the police officer who knows a magical girl)

[21-May-2016 22:00:34]  <Calica> and I have a 6 from the see, right?
[21-May-2016 22:00:39]  <IllFlower> Yeah.

[21-May-2016 22:04:17]  <IllFlower> The man turns his gun to point off the balcony, down where Emiko and Noriko still are, and squeezes off a random shot.
[21-May-2016 22:04:30]  <IllFlower> @dice add d10 >! blind fire

[21-May-2016 22:05:06]  <Calica> do any of us have fallout this time around?
[21-May-2016 22:05:11]  <IllFlower> No.
[21-May-2016 22:07:16]  <Rig> Amazing.
[21-May-2016 22:09:27]  <IllFlower> All right, fallout done. So what are we doing with this fellow?
[21-May-2016 22:11:03]  <BGTB2005> disarming and then interrogating him?
[21-May-2016 22:11:29]  <Calica> sounds ok to me
[21-May-2016 22:11:42]  <Rig> Sounds like a good plan. Need to find out more about Rinzen, right?
[21-May-2016 22:13:27]  <IllFlower> Figuring out who this dude is might be a good plan.
[21-May-2016 22:13:52]  <Rig> Also good.
[21-May-2016 22:15:28]  <IllFlower> Your call.
[21-May-2016 22:17:28]  <Rig> Should we just interrogate him on the landing here? What about the fire he started?
[21-May-2016 22:17:41]  <Calica> yeah we should probably get away from the fire
[21-May-2016 22:17:46]  <IllFlower> There's just lighter fluid all over the ground. No fire yet.
[21-May-2016 22:18:00]  <IllFlower> Don't drop your cigarette butts on the fourth-story balcony.
[21-May-2016 22:18:06]  <Rig> Heh
[21-May-2016 22:18:22]  <Calica> none of our magical girls are smokers, are they?
[21-May-2016 22:18:27]  <Rig> Not this time.
[21-May-2016 22:18:45]  <Rig> So, interrogate him where he stands?
[21-May-2016 22:20:30]  <Calica> probably easier than moving him
[21-May-2016 22:21:07]  <Rig> True.
[21-May-2016 22:22:23]  <Rig> Noriko and Emiko rush up the stairs to join Satori who has already taken the gun. She holds it carefully like it might bite her.
[21-May-2016 22:22:34]  <IllFlower> It's made of teeth.
[21-May-2016 22:22:49]  <Calica> interesting magical weapon imho

[21-May-2016 22:24:18]  <Rig> "Who are you?"
[21-May-2016 22:24:51]  <Calica> (*extremely Shadow voice* DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION)
[21-May-2016 22:25:23]  <IllFlower> "Kasuga," the man spits. "Tomoyuki Kasuga."
[21-May-2016 22:27:11]  <Rig> "You work for Rinzen?"
[21-May-2016 22:28:05]  <IllFlower> "Seems like you already know the answer to that question.
[21-May-2016 22:28:45]  <IllFlower> "Who the fuck are you? Some kind of superpowered manga girls?"
[21-May-2016 22:29:53]  <Rig> Hahaha.
[21-May-2016 22:29:57]  <Calica> basically
[21-May-2016 22:30:12]  <Rig> What information do we want to get out of him?
[21-May-2016 22:32:17]  <Calica> I'm not entirely sure, honestly.
[21-May-2016 22:33:11]  <IllFlower> Might be good to ask how he's been constantly finding Sanada...
[21-May-2016 22:33:34]  <Rig> "How did you know where to find Sanada?"
[21-May-2016 22:35:57]  <Rig> Apparently I ordered my dinner to be delivered to the wrong place.
[21-May-2016 22:36:07]  <Calica> oops
[21-May-2016 22:37:01]  <IllFlower> "Why would I tell you?"
[21-May-2016 22:37:59]  <Calica> "Because it's the right thing to do, obviously.  Or because we have you surrounded."
[21-May-2016 22:40:59]  <IllFlower> Kasuga looks around. Guess Emiko's right.
[21-May-2016 22:42:16]  <IllFlower> just a sec
[21-May-2016 22:46:31]  <IllFlower> "We've got a cute little birdie inside the police, obviously. Telling us everything we need to know."
[21-May-2016 22:48:42]  <Calica> i can't believe Icon is passing on information to a drug ring
[21-May-2016 22:50:25]  <Rig> I knew something was up with her.
[21-May-2016 22:50:30]  <Rig> Finally got my food.
[21-May-2016 22:50:43]  <Rig> Who wants to bet that Higashiyama is the leak?
[21-May-2016 22:52:04]  <Calica> It could also be the other one we've met
[21-May-2016 22:52:22]  <BGTB2005> Inamura?
[21-May-2016 22:53:01]  <IllFlower> You could... ask...
[21-May-2016 22:53:26]  <Calica> "Who's the mole?"
[21-May-2016 22:54:05]  <Rig> "Is it Higashiyama?" Noriko asks. The soreness in her ribs flared up after all minimal amount of running she did.
[21-May-2016 22:54:16]  <BGTB2005> "I thought it was a bird?"
[21-May-2016 22:56:04]  <IllFlower> "If you already know everything, why do you keep asking me?
[21-May-2016 22:56:14]  <IllFlower> "For fuck's sake."
[21-May-2016 22:57:54]  <Rig> I almost feel sorry for him.
[21-May-2016 22:58:23]  <Rig> "We just expected you to be a little bit more important." (Noriko rolls for her jerk trait.)
[21-May-2016 22:59:04]  <Rig> Should we string him up and actually call the cops?
[21-May-2016 22:59:15]  <IllFlower> What if one of them is Higashiyama?
[21-May-2016 22:59:27]  <Calica> gotta make sure one of 'em isn't Higashiyama, yeah
[21-May-2016 23:00:07]  <Rig> That seems a little difficult to do without weirdly implicating ourselves.
[21-May-2016 23:00:24]  <Rig> We could just have him contact Higashiyama and try to take them both out?
[21-May-2016 23:00:40]  <IllFlower> Or drag him to a police box yourselves.
[21-May-2016 23:00:59]  <IllFlower> I mean, it seems kinda unlikely that she'd be in that particular box.
[21-May-2016 23:02:50]  <Rig> Law of Narrative Coefficient says she would be.
[21-May-2016 23:02:56]  <Rig> But yeah, that sounds fine.
[21-May-2016 23:03:03]  <IllFlower> In any case, we've hit three hours, so we can pick up next time.
[21-May-2016 23:03:15]  <IllFlower> Let's assume Kasuga gets turned in and everything is fine.
[21-May-2016 23:03:20]  <Rig> Cool. A good session. Guns came out and no one died.
[21-May-2016 23:03:22]  <Rig> A first.
[21-May-2016 23:03:25]  <IllFlower> 'Cause, man, he's a dick.
[21-May-2016 23:04:04]  <IllFlower> Thanks for playing, all. See you in a week.
